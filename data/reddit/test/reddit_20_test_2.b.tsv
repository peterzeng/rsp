&gt;John Farmer, Jr., senior counsel to the Commission stated that the Commission ""discovered that...what government and military officials had told Congress, the Commission, the media, and the public about who knew what when — was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue."" Farmer continues: ""At some level of the government, at some point in time … there was a decision not to tell the truth about what happened...The (NORAD) tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public.""[23] Thomas Kean, the head of the 9/11 Commission, concurred: ""We to this day don’t know why NORAD told us what they told us, it was just so far from the truth.""[24]

Are you abusing the word wrong in context to Dave Ramsey then?

Also, do you understand what my argument is? It isn't very apparent that you do because your response is ""yes this math is correct"". Did I say your math was wrong? Did I say that paying off the highest interest loan wasn't the optimal solution solely in terms of saving money?

&gt;\&gt; Here is an argument. For people who have debt, should they\-  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;1.\) Continue making bad financial decisions\(pay off loans based on fun and feelings weeeeee\)  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;2.\) Make the correct decision  
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;Are you promoting that people that poorly manage money to continue poorly managing money?

That isn't an argument nor is it even convincing on an rhetorical level. Its a poorly constructed false dilemma combined with a strawman. I am not taking it seriously because you aren't taking it seriously.

&gt;\&gt;You are completely wrong.

There are great arguments in favor of the debt avalanche method with the main one being that it maximizes the amount of money you save when paying off loans. This is incredibly obvious and nobody contests it.

Making a post where you claim that the debt avalanche is the best method to pay off debt and only making the argument from the point of it being mathematically optimal is really silly.

This is the equivalent to going on a weight loss forum and claiming that X diet plan is wrong and all you need to do is cut calories to lose weight... Yeah, we all kind of know that cutting calories is how is how you lose weight, you aren't providing some sort of revelation to anyone, everyone here knows this... The people on the forum are actually dealing with real people and real circumstances and trying to find the most optimal solution for that person. The goal is of course the same, to maximize weight loss, but the people on the forum know that if they don't factor in the person when they give advice that they aren't giving good advice."

24	"I think part of the issue with those involved combat systems is that they take away from the larger scale that makes TES games so fun. They're big games with a lot of places to go and things to do. In a more focused experience, like Dark Souls, that really involving combat system works, but I think in a game where one dungeon is often just a quick excursion before you launch yourself into any number of other opportunities available, you don't want every fight to be this super intense thing.

Like, people complain about the combat and go on and on about how bad it is, but the combat has clearly never prevented the series from gaining in popularity. TES games are about the larger experience for most people, not the combat, I think too complex or challenging of a system would be too far removed from what the series has previously been trying to attain.

Granted, I'm not saying it couldn't be better, but something like Dark Souls combat would be super out of place in a TES game."

34	Hawks were only brielfy mentioned in like the second episode with zero call backs. They even took one of our two charscrers in the series (korver hawk)	"Nope... The Libs were the ones who introduced this mismatch technologies. Lab had pretty much everyone on Fibre to the Premises (FTTP). 

Libs decided Fibre to the Node (FTTN) would be good enough. This decision was made based on a bunch of assumptions that went against all expert advice and evidence:

1. The existing Copper Network had been maintained to an adequate level. Instead, the Copper Network is falling apart and a huge roadblock in the Government's ability to use 100-year-old infrastructure as the basis of their next century technology.

2. That our infrastructure needs over the next 100 years could be based on mediocre global contemporary needs (FTTN wasn't really that impressive at the time it was announced). FTTN would have made us a decently well-equipped nation 5-10 years ago, but just about every expert knew it wouldn't be enough to sustain emergent technologies and needs. FTTN just won't cut it for what we will want/need to do in 10-20 years. 

3. That rapidly increasing internet usage would *plateau* for no real reason whatsoever. Youth engagement with the internet is skyrocketing, modern business projections all point the rising need of quality internet access. The Libs in their infinite wisdom decided that future generations would find no more uses for the internet than we had and that we had pretty much reached peak internet. 

[Malcolm even had a fancy whiteboard presentation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/aug/26/malcolm-turnbull-nbn-internet-speed-whiteboard-video), where he arbitrarily cut off internet usage needs at about ~8mb range to make it seem like FTTN would be all we needed going forward.


Then in an attempt to cover their mistakes, the Libs have rolled out a wide range of Not Quite Right style NBN projects and that's where this current mismanaged lottery system comes from. 

Now depending on your luck and assuming you are in a urban/suburban enviroment, you might have:

1. FTTP (if you were lucky to get connected during Lab Government).

2. Fibre to the Curb (FTTC), where the Liberal government has decided to effectively concede their FTTP vs FTTN debate without actually conceding or giving us the 100% best solution available.

3. Hybrid Fibre Co-Axial (HFC), basically a FTTN spinoff that involves using the same cables pay TV does. Also Lib.

4. FTTN, if you were unfortunate enough to be one of the *lucky* people to have their NBN rollout during the early Lib years.



This mess is labelled  Multi-Technology Mix (MTM) and advertised as a good thing, but it's really just the Liberal party fucking up. 



Oh, and lets not forget how [Malcom Turnbull had investments in a French FTTP company](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/turnbull-likes-fibre-to-the-home--in-france-20120821-24kpe.html) while saying there wasn't a market value in FTTP technology...

&gt; This sub and all the research posted here really has opened my eyes regarding child trafficking. Thank you to everyone here for all the research you’ve shared. There is clear evidence that child trafficking is a worldwide industry. The most frightening part of it is that it is not a poorly-financed group of petty criminals – it a well-financed, well-organised operation. And it is used by large capital interests, primarily to entrap and blackmail people in power, including politicians, businessmen, the media, and even the police. If you’re wondering why our governments seem to continually serve large corporate interests instead of their voters, this is one of the reasons.

&gt; The material is out there and it is reliable. So much work has gone into investigating the issue and producing the material – all I’ve done is put it together into one package to tell a comprehensive narrative, so you can see it all in one place. This is what I’ve done – the film is called Imperium and I’ll release it tomorrow. The film is split into ten parts, told over two films (Volume I is 1hr57, Volume II is 2hr40). Once I release it it will be yours. It belongs to all of you and always has. I hope it sheds some light on the issue.

"In the Vedas a story is related of the primordial man Purusha, who was cut up into parts that became all of humanity. The head became Brahmins (priests, scholars, and teachers), the arms became the Kshatriyas (warriors, rulers, and administrators), the thighs became the Vaishyas (farmers and merchants), and the feet became the Shudras (laborers and servants). Dalits are those who didn’t fit into this scheme (with other groups becoming scheduled tribes for various complicated reasons). How literally anyone takes this story depends on their philosophical outlook within Hinduism, but most would probably see it as being metaphor for the transcendental nature of the self while also providing a very basic principle of how to set up and maintain an agricultural society rather than a literal description of cosmic events.

Historically, an extremely simplified version would be to say that the early Indo-Iranians responsible for developing Vedic philosophy likely had the same “priest-soldier-farmer” societal division you see in every other Indo-European culture and religion, and then kept adding rungs to the bottom over time. Those native to Bactria and Pakistan/Northern India when they migrated would’ve become Shudras, with Dalits as a later development.

If I get started on Trump we're likely to get in a fist-fight....so I try and change the subject or just leave the room.

There is no arguing with these people. It's terrible how a big part of the American electorate has been duped by this swine. "	"The article explains it:

(TL;DR There is possibly a defect in the brain circuitry that prevents schizophrenics from recognizing the voice as their own.)

&gt;Whenever a person hears her own voice, an unconscious recognition circuit lights up in the brain. It works by comparing the sound she hears with the expected sound of her voice, a prediction honed through years of experience with conversation. If the actual voice matches the prediction, the brain concludes that the voice was self-generated. Alternatively, if the heard voice doesn’t match the prediction, the brain concludes that someone else is speaking.

&gt;Schizophrenic patients like Brandon are believed to have a defect in this circuit. When Brandon hears his own voice, the unconscious matching system incorrectly identifies a mismatch (false negative) and prevents him from consciously recognizing that it is his own speech that he’s experiencing. His brain is left to reconcile two seemly contradictory pieces of information: on the one hand he hears a voice that isn’t his own. On the other hand, there’s nobody else in the room. So, whose voice is it?

&gt;The brain tries to generate the most logical explanation it can. Who could project a voice into Brandon’s mind who isn’t in his vicinity? Perhaps someone with access to impressive technologies—someone with the means and motivation to spy on him. Someone from the FBI? That’s possible. If an agent had implanted a chip in his brain, that would explain the voice in his head. If the agent has been spying on Brandon for a while, that would explain why the voice seems to know so much about him.

&gt;The brain is a master storyteller, designed to make sense of the chaos of our lives. It compensates for the presence of auditory hallucinations, caused by a defect in self-recognition, by writing a narrative to account for them. It's no accident that schizophrenic patients reach for spy agencies, religious entities, or supernatural forces when describing the voices in their heads. These are theories that the brain concocts to explain how a foreign voice could infiltrate a mind, know it intimately, and torment its victim with relentless surveillance. Faced with such bewildering circumstances, the explanation the brain generates is surprisingly logical.

"Are those differences between axons in a discrete or continuous range? I'm guessing those changes affect the voltage potential as the presence of ions at either side of the synaptic gap will cause an increase of voltage potential with an increase in charge, and the gap length will determine a voltage potential at which the charge will jump from one axon to the next over the gap.

So not only is it then not binary, discretizing the synapse properties would lead to potentially a very high number base. For example, if there were even 10 charge states corresponding to 10 gap widths (since gap width and total charge before firing are not linearly independent), that's still a base 10 number instead of a base 2 number.  Even at base 2, 7000 synapses is still a humongous number. Any higher base would be unfathomable, like say base 10, because it's a 7000-digit number.  I don't think it's right to quantify it in divisions of any word size other other 7000 digits isn't really representative at all, because the total neuron state would be all 7000 synapses simultaneously it seems to me."

What this means is that while there can be good looking short dudes, and ugly tall dudes, stating that being over 6ft makes one attractive is more correct than it is wrong.  Being 6ft gives you a huge increase in your chances of sucessful online dating.  Almost anyone short or tall with any significant experience in online dating will agree with this."

If the ultimate goal of Indian religions is to reach Moksha, then surely being rich is not the defining factor. One could reach this as a poor person in India perhaps even more likely than someone who never had to experience any negative material experiences. The story of Buddha was that he was born in great wealth, but he deliberately abandoned it in order to achieve nirvana. He literally was a beggar.

"The extremely high incidence of abusive backgrounds in criminals, and the specific claim about serial rapists being abused by women as children, are both common knowledge among feminists who work on those topics.  They are not denied or suppressed.   

There is the expected scepticism because criminals are motivated to invent or exaggerate an abusive background as a mitigating factor in sentencing, but I don't see feminists doing that more than anyone else.  

I knew almost nothing about Breivik but your first paragraph immediately made me think ""narcissist mother"", which turns out to be the case.   They both were severe narcissists.   The mix of heredity and the specific type of abuse narcissists do often creates narcissism or BPD and makes it common for people to be able to identify three generations of narcissists in their family.  

I have a lot of contact with children of narcissists.  Direct sexual abuse by the parents is unusual, though very much more common than in the general population.   A much more typical scenario is a narc mother ignoring or tolerating her live in BF's abuse of her daughter, blaming it on the daughter if she is told.   

I know someone who was made to sleep with her horrifically abusive narcissist mother until I think 15.  It was not sexual, and I've seen other similar cases with Nmoms so you should not assume a sexual aspect just from that.   
You mentioned her encouraging him to touch another man's penis.  That could be all sorts of N monkey business, you can't classify it as sexually motivated abuse without further info.   

A grotesque lack of insight is normal for narcissists, his claim his mother had nothing to do with it seems ridiculous after reading a review of Seierstad's book on him.

I have a couple family members who have gone this route, too, and it's unfortunate because I don't want to be around them. They are toxic, negative, and the irresponsible use of deliberate and egregious misinformation sets an extremely bad example for others, particularly children.

These are people who would have once scolded their kids for using the type of Twitter insult Donald Trump slings, but now go out of their way to justify it. I don't really have any way to justify their behavior - it's simply bad, and while they're certainly within rights to be negative, malicious, and misleading, I don't see any reason to be their audience. Especially since any attempt at reason is met with hostility or conspiracy theory. Note, by the way, this isn't even political reason. This is reasoning like ""Would your mother have appreciated the type language you just used? Would you teach it to your own kids?"" Or, ""That information is verifiably inaccurate and here is a source to the actual data."" Those aren't political refutations, they aren't coming from or using a political source, they're just attempts at grounding someone in reality and reasonable discussion.

&gt;For the next release of Litecoin reference client, we will reduce the relay fees from 0.001 LTC/kb ($0.30/kb) to 0.00001 LTC ($0.003/kb). We hope to have that out next week. Once people are using the new relay fees, we will reduce the actual min fee to 0.0001 LTC/kb ($0.03/kb).

&gt;I'm proposing an upgrade to Litecoin with a soft fork that will let miners signal their min accepted fee in the block header. This will let a fee market develop without having us decide what the min fee is. Will also make it easier for users to estimate fees. More details later.

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949746681662205952
&gt;1/ Technical info: Use 5 of the version bits (fee_bits) to specify min fee rate 

&gt;min_fee_rate = 2^fee_bits (in litoshi) 

&gt;Soft fork enforces that all transaction in that block has a fee rate higher than min_fee_rate and that fee_bits is set to highest possible.

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949747438117535744
&gt;2/ This accomplishes 2 things. 

&gt;1) min fee rate is stored in block headers, so SPV clients can look at it to more easily calculate a good fee. For example, median min fee rate of last 100 blocks means that &gt;50% of hashrate will mine that transaction. So it should confirm in 2 blk

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949748150201303040
&gt;3/ 

&gt;2) Miners can choose to not mine low fee transactions to signal to the market to increase the fees. This should help create a fee market.

&gt;If mining is competitive, this should lead to a good fee market. I'm convinced this will work. I think worthwhile to test on Litecoin.

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949751747186122752
&gt;4/ As @pwuille pointed out, out of band fee payments can skew the results. But I think median min fee rate will not be skewed much at all and will be useful. 

&gt;The other important thing is to remove us (developers) from deciding and changing what the min fee and relay fee is.

191	"&gt; that's fine -- it's a singular angel at any given time, defined by the role. he's identified as yahweh because by definition he is speaking in place of yahweh. it's later hellenistic judaism that singles this role out as a specific identity rather than a role.

Yes, I agree, any angel is singular at any given time.  Any angel who is titled as an angel of the Lord is contextually *the* angel of the Lord.  Similarly, any dog is *the* dog if he is the only dog in a given scene.  There is, it is needless to say, no discrete being of ""the angel of the Lord"" affirmed to exist in the Hebrew Bible though.

I would not necessarily say that a given angel is identified as YHVH simply because he is speaking in the place of YHVH (though I wouldn't disagree).  Rather, I would say an angel is identified with YHVH because an angel is not a discrete being, rather being an avatar, manifestation, or conduit of YHVH.  I think it would perhaps be more apt to refer to ""angel of the Lord"" as something along the lines of ""instance of the Lord"".

&gt; yahweh is one of the three. the other two go on to sodom, where they appear to act in yahweh's stead.

If it is presupposed that YHVH cannot be expressed from multiple instances, then one ought to assume that YHVH cannot be all these beings.  Yet I don't know that this presupposition aptly applies to the theology in the Hebrew Bible.  There certainly were those affirming multiple instances of YHVH (YHVH of Teman, Samaria, Hebron, Zion, etc.) who functioned simultaneously.  In this story, the company of angels are introduced with the manifestation of YHVH, and they function collectively and without clear distinguishment.  YHVH proceeds to speak from one of the men, and perhaps it is this embodiment who continues to converse as YHVH throughout the entire following scene with Abraham.  Yet despite being on Earth in some capacity, YHVH expresses his intentions to descend to Sodom and Gomorrah (and in the later scene YHVH observes Sodom and Gomorrah out from heaven).  YHVH's location continues to also be in heaven and he functions out of heaven, even when he has manifested himself on Earth.  If YHVH can conflate himself with various entities and able to express himself from multiple instances, it seems natural enough that at the onset of the story YHVH is expressing himself in three beings.

You don't have to agree, but it still remains the case that YHVH is expressed here through at least one embodied, isolated, emissarial being who lacks the moniker ""the angel of the Lord"".  There is no suggestion in the Hebrew Bible that there exists a discrete ""the angel of the Lord"" who alone can express an embodiment of YHVH in the world.  YHVH, in typical ANE style, can conflate and express himself without much restraint.

&gt; part of the problem is that there's a layer of redaction in the text. some appearances of yahweh seem to have been redacted to say ""angel"". the akedah is another instance of this. that obviously complicates later theology, further conflating these concepts.

I don't know that this is a problem in this instance.  In Genesis, Jacob does not clearly wrestle with either an angel or YHVH.  Instead, he wrestles with (an?) Elohim.  It is instead Hosea, agreeing that Jacob wrestles with Elohim, who identifies said Elohim as an angel who is identified as YHVH.  I don't see what part of Hosea here was redacted, nor to end it would be in this way redacted.  It also doesn't seem that Hosea is confused by an earlier text, for he begins with Elohim and it is he who subsequently introduces both ""angel"" and ""YHVH"" into the equation.  It seems Hosea simply doesn't see a conflict with YHVH being expressed and conflated with a given angel.

Regardless, I don't think asserting that the Hebrew Bible was redacted which confused later theologies defends the position of the other commenter, nor do I think it shows that YHVH can only conflate and express himself through one, discrete ""the angel of the Lord""."

The current system is so flawed, and for a number of reasons. We are placing way too much weight on the actions and decisions of 18–22 year olds, which has negative impact for them and for society as a whole.

I’m sort of the poster child for this issue. I was always a smart kid (not trying to brag this is just a relevant detail) who became increasingly disinterested in school due to the fact that I didn’t really see any value in most of it, but more importantly due to undiagnosed depression. Things were at their worst in college when I slept about half of the day away and just barely maintained grades good enough to avoid being kicked out of school. I was finally diagnosed with depression during my senior year and things began to turn around for me, and by the time I graduated I was in a good place. I realized a few years later that graduate school was in order, but I felt like my options were really limited due to the old cumulative GPA weighing me down. I could apply myself as much as I wanted and could do everything perfectly in the present tense, but I couldn’t escape a number that represented me as a depressed 19 year old who really had no relation to the present tense version of me.

I managed to get into school and became a physical therapist, and now I’m planning to apply to medical school in 2019, but I really feel like I defied the odds to get to this point. I very easily could have spent years applying to schools with no success, and I would have been stuck at a dead end with no ability to pursue certain paths even if I was doing everything in my power to further myself. This current system was so close to keeping me from doing the things I’m capable of doing, as well as keeping me from becoming a more productive member of society that might fill a needed role in healthcare or whatever else I may have found as a calling.

As I was fishing off the dock, minding my own business, I spotted a patrol boat sailing up the river. I continued catching trout as I watched the driver sail straight through my line towards the dock. She did a sharp turn and ended up crashing her boat right on top of my dock. 

For the next five minutes I sat there while the stranded boat driver kept complimenting me while ranting about the cult. The boats gunner was hanging around on the shore when all of a sudden he started shooting. Out of no where a bear runs up and attacks me. The boat driver didn’t make it and her friend got knocked down, but I picked him back up. 

After killing the bear, I continued on with fishing for the next ten or so minutes. I started hearing the faint sound of a planes motor. The sound got closer and closer. I looked up from my little dock and saw the plane for a brief moment. Very quickly the plane took a nosedive right into the hillside surrounding the lagoon. 

All of this happened within the course of thirty or so minutes. I did manage to catch plenty of trout in that lagoon! I’ve been really enjoying my time vacationing in Hope County. "	technology	gaming	-1

Can you detail how your security is being surrendered? What exactly prevents a hostile entity from walking into a women's bathroom at any given point? Are you advocating for some sort of armed guard to be placed at the entry points of each bathroom in all public bathrooms? 

You have an interesting point with comfort. As a man if I'm not comfortable with women being in the military, because women introduce a lot of additional expense (feminine hygiene, bras, smaller clothing sizes than the existing male soldiers, separated bedding and bathroom facilities, etc). I also know that as women can potentially become pregnant there's times where women have gotten pregnant prior to deployment and have had to delay their deployment which is a hindrance to military operations and planning. As a man, I'm uncomfortable with the idea that fellow male soldiers thus either have to pick up the slack or be recalled to duty earlier than their regularly scheduled deployment. Lastly women are easily seen as sexual objects and can interfere with the mission of our men in uniform. It's a basic reality and should be addressed.

On a desktop you have many processes that all run at the same time and are competing for resources which can slow things down if it gets too overloaded. However things work differently on mobile platforms. People don't realize that apps aren't always running in the background and that iOS ""freezes"" them and will kill them off completely if it needs more resources. People still think you need to close apps to get better performance out of the device. This logic is also perpetuated by these stupid ""cleaning"" apps that claim to improve device performance cleaning cache or killing processes or whatever ridiculous crap they claim these days. There's probably also some kind of OCD component where people don't like things being in the app switcher even though they known they're not running.

269	"Nerfing Eviolite is a terrible idea. Just saying😂 with that being said, one Pokémon I wish was competitively viable is Lickilicky. Lickilicky has this dopey design, and I love it, but despite it’s solid physical move pool, its 85 base attack isn’t doing it any favors.

Bulk-wise, it’s great. 110 hp, 95 and 95 defenses. No changes needed.

Based on the move pool, and the lack of special attacks, it’s obvious it was intended to be a special attacker.  Attack 100 (+15) Sp. Atk 65 (-15) 

The last move Lickilicky learns via leveling up is Gyro Ball. Despite being slow enough as it is, it still outspeeds quite a bit, and could do significantly more damage to Pokémon with lower speed. Speed 25 (-25). 

I would also give it the ability to learn Thrash. Thrash would be amazing on Lickilicki, with 120 base power STAB, plus own tempo to keep it from getting confused

With these changes, I would run

Lickilicky @ Figy Berry
Own Tempo
Brave Nature
IVs: 0 Speed
EVs 252 HP 252 Atk 4 SpDef
-Belly Drum
-Thrash
-Power Whip/Earthquake
-Gyro Ball

The minimum speed helps deal the most possible damage  with gyro Ball, which helps take out fairy, rock and ice types.  Of course, this would most likely be used on a Trick Room team, so between Power Whip and Earthquake, it comes down to the coverage of the rest of your team. Earthquake would be better in a singles battle, that was you have coverage against Steel types, whereas in doubles, you could run Power Whip and let a teammate have a way to cover steel types (a fire type for instance, Power Whip would cover all types that threaten a fire type). Thrash provides massive stab without the confusion drawback due to Own Tempo, and the belly drum/Figy berry combo is just way too good to pass up on a Pokémon like this."

281	"I mean I ride and I also have a new Mercedes (which means the interior is very quiet) but when merging in LA, I still hear motorcycles when they are about 30 feet behind me and so I actively look for it.
"	"I've read the 9.9% article the Atlantic published, I don't believe it exonerates the 1% or the .01%. The article simply adds another detail of the stratification of the economy and the current inequality. The people that are reading the Atlantic, or the NY times and watching MSNBC/FOX/CNN/YOUTUBE NEWS are likely a part of this 9.9%. They have kids getting tutored for the SATs, they have money but feel it isn't enough bc everyone in America is looking upwards at the billionaires instead of surveying the levels below and seeing that if they just gave up a little bit, everyone would be better off. But I do want to say the 9.9% article is really fantastically written and worth a read purely on it's own merits as an article.

In this article they say Reeves and Stewart are arguing it's a conscious effort by people in these upper brackets to hoard wealth which, at least for Stewart's article, is not exactly what he's arguing. The argument, as I read it, is much closer to : the 9.9% act out of self preservation spending on tutors for their kids and locking up their zipcodes (NIMBYism) as the only way to maintain their place in the economy; to maintain their property value and avoid the high expense of college tuition. However, the 1% tends to actively push other down by not paying higher wages, by funding politicians that will obey, etc. 

I think this distinction is important though certainly not an excuse. I have a family member who is practically a case study of being in the 9.9%- free college, fell into a cush job selling insurance and yet his siblings are unable to pay their mortgage but his only suggestion is for them to work harder, to hustle. Two have gone back to school (now indebted), one works 2 jobs and has a roommate, no health insurance and no retirement at 59. Yet they aren't working hard enough. He spent his summer in Florida in a condo he owns. 

The point of that story is he isn't unwilling to help but he is unable to understand the issues of the lower class in America. He doesn't see that housing is too large of an expense on the avg salary or health insurance (which he sells) isn't economical. 

I suggest reading both articles and keeping your salt shaker close for both in case you find some distasteful points that don't mesh well with other sources.

Here's the article in question: The Atlantic: The 9.9 Percent Is the New American Aristocracy.
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/?utm_source=feed


Edit: The main attack in this article is on sloppy data by Stewart (I agree) and Reeves points which I cannot contest/defend or comment on as I haven't read the book (Dream Hoarders). I found Stewart's article important precisely bc of it's grouping which states that even owning property and having a net worth is better than 90% of Americans. Having security in the resource of shelter (parents home or otherwise) is an important safety net that many go without. 

TL;DR the stratification by Stewart is oversimplified but, I think, helpful in organizing the inequality argument and definitions of wealth and isn't ""distracting"" from the problem of the 1% but clarifying the levels of the economy. Cannot and will not defend speak to the attack on Reeves."	business	Economics	-1

Look at banks. Banks are incredibly regulated. My father was a CFO of a mid-sized bank. One of their claims to *success* was lower NFS fees. This attracted obviously lots of poorer customers who willingly overdrew their accounts and racked up charges. The government sees this and says that's exploitation. His bank did a study of the customers who overdrew to understand why they were doing this. They found out it wasn't from a lack of understanding how NFS charges work but that it was ***cheaper*** than the alternative like a late phone bill or power bill! This same finding occurred when evaluating pay day loans. [Source](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/payday-loans/).

286	"The functionality has been in Chrome for a few releases now, what's changing in Chrome 66 is that it's being enabled *by default*.

If you're using Chrome today and want to turn it on, you can go to `chrome://flags`, search for the flag titled ""Autoplay Policy"" and change its setting to ""Document user activation is required"".

Since mid-October, Chrome has been keeping track of which sites you regularly watch video on and if you both visit a site regularly *and* regularly allow videos with sound to play for more then 7 seconds, Chrome will allow that site to continue to autoplay video.  (This is to allow sites like YouTube and Netflix to continue to work like you want them to.)   You can view Chrome's statistics on how often you watch video on a site by going to `about://media-engagement`.  Any row with ""Is High"" that reads 'Yes' will be able to autoplay videos.

Also, this autoplay policy only applies to videos that aren't muted.  Muted videos, or videos without sound will continue to be able to autoplay.  This also applies to *any* sound by the webpage -- pages won't be able to make sound until you interact with them by clicking on them.

Also keep in mind some sites, like CNN, use some underhanded tricks to get around this autoplay restriction (by not actually navigating to a new page when you click a link; but instead just swapping out the *current* page's content) so they'll still be able to 'autoplay' on everything *except* the first page you visit until Chrome comes up with some plan to address that behavior.   For sites like that, you can permanently mute them by right-clicking on the tab and choosing ""Mute site"", which will persist between visits.  (You can undo ""Mute site"" by clicking on the icon at the left edge of the address bar and changing the permissions for Sound back to ""Use global default"".)   In those cases, video will still play, but it won't be allowed to make any sound."	"Thank you, Alan.

I won't argue that people don't *feel* love for animals in general. I'd just argue that killing animals when you have a choice not to kill them isn't how you should *act* when you love animals.

It's like a father who abandons his children will often say he still loves them. I don't doubt he still cares for them in plenty of ways. He has just done absolutely nothing that would prove that. In fact he has acted the opposite of how someone who loves their children should *act*.

The discrepancy people have in regards to animals is that people often ""love animals"" only because of how animals make them feel. They love animals because they are silly, interesting, cute, etc. Or even how they taste. They love animals for the feelings animals give them.

My main point is that if you truly love animals you should do what is in their best interest. You should *act* like you love animals and not just say it.

307	Cars in the 60s were rated by gross horsepower, so an engine on a stand running with all of its accessories powered by something else. In the early 70s and about the time smog and gas laws changed they also changed to net horsepower, so the engine had to run powering all of it's own accessories. So you have an identical engine in 1969 making 300 horsepower going down to 200. Add on smog equipment which improved emissions but caused worse combustion of fuel means that same 1969 runs extra smog equipment which drained power and also burnt the same amount of fuel less effectively causing a double whammy of power loss.

Once he does(it takes a few minutes, making me a bit impatient), I reapproach and flash my brights at him to signal he move over. He doesn't, so I flash them again (I have halogen headlights so I know it can be blinding to get flashed). He brakes, and slows down to about 45 mph(still a 55).

I’m sorry you haven’t heard from your half brother. When I messaged my biological father’s daughter she deleted her Ancestry profile, but thankfully used her real name so I could still find him (I initially thought I was the product of a known affair my mother had.) I’ve matched to two donor conceived half siblings since finding out and it’s gone much better with them. One already knew and one didn’t know, but has been open to a relationship. I think it’s easier to talk to DC siblings, because you’re all in the same boat. When you talk to your donor or his family you feel like an interloper.

This is entirely wrong. Open source uses copyright as an  enforcement mechanism for the provisions in the license. Ask RMS - here is not in favor of removing copyright because then there is no way to stop people from taking open source code and using it in closed source applications, and no way to compel them to release updates too their derivative copy of the codebase.

Without copyright, I could take the linux kernel, make a bunch of modifications to it, then release the binary and you'd have no way to force me to release my changes. I could ignore the attribution provision in the licenses that require it. There would be no limits because you wouldn't have any claim of ownership. Open source is only possible because of copyright.

4. Not on my end. There has been some issues with the non biological mother adopting the kid. I'd say legal inconvenience rather than problems.

358	Nothing really, but from a functional perspective, training should reflect the tasks you plan to do. Training for a longer plank when you are already capable of holding one for a minute is probably unnecessary and would net you diminishing returns compared to training for stability in other positions and then stability during dynamic movements.  Holding a single position for a long time can also be unpleasant and boring for many people. And from an athletic performance point of view, you'll get way more bang for your buck with training explosive movements and lifting than working to improve your plank hold time. This said, none of these mean you shouldn't go for it, if a long plank time is something you care about!	At 54, I concur.

360	Was reading further up in the thread. There's a theory that for some animals, like whales (I'm going to paraphrase a lot here), they are so big that a tumor will grow on their cancer tumor before it reaches lethal size, and that second tumor will kill the first one. Essentially their cancer gets cancer before it can kill them. From what else I read, whales have some tumor suppressing genes. There's a theory someone mentioned up there that is based off of the fact that larger animals technically should get more cancer than us, but proportionally don't. It's still an open field.

I don't know if Parmar did it, you can go either way, he wasn't charged in court and then he was picked up by police and killed later on. Something that the Indian government has done to innocent Sikhs countless times. Some believe he was an agent or a person that may have done the attack out of political revenge. Jagmeet Singh wanted to make sure that the narrative of Sikhs wanting revenge on Hindus was dead, this attack was political, media all around have skewed it for their agendas, especially the Indian media who use it to defame the Sikh rights movement during the 80's and 90's.  I get people wanted a more straight answer but we're all in the same boat, no one knows who is officially responsible, until then we can't just go around and condemn people, but we can condemn the act. If evidence comes up in the future which directly and unequivocally shows Parmar as responsible then you'll see jagmeet Singh and all other Sikh politicians condemn him and his acts. Until then they'll continue to denounce the act and the skewing of the truth by media.

416	"&gt; Is WPvP seen as a waste of time? It's literally the core purpose of warmode, why does it need compensation? No such ""compensation"" existed on PvP servers for the last 13 years, why is it suddenly needed now?

Because the carrot and stick changed. Once they made Warmode optional, they needed *something* to introduce new players to PvP (in this case, risk vs reward). Look how much the PvP scene shrank over the years. They didn't want to risk launching Warmode with only the hardest of core players PvPing it out (and it would have been boring seeing such a small group of players like that). Having played almost exclusively on PvP servers, I knew a bunch of people that only played on PvP servers for the chance of finding a bigger guild, but were never interested in PvP because there wasn't much of a reward in world PvP, and in the process never really had the incentive to learn how to PvP (and it got really boring fighting someone who just essentially took the ganking without putting up a fight, simply because they knew you'd eventually get bored).

Do I think the current implementation of Warmode is perfect? No, but at the same time, I appreciate it for what it is. The rewards (10% resources AND the Conquest system included) adds more of a compelling reason to actually stay flagged for PvP, and I know very real examples of people (in my guild especially) who dipped their feet into it this expansion and are now introducing themselves to PvP and are actually learning to fight instead of just staying away from it altogether."

It would mean that more than 20% of all humans have experienced sexual abuse. Something a quarter of all women, a sixth of all men experienced would mean the number of perpetrators is insanely huge and the number of survivors even higher.

That should not mean something like that is okay, not that it can ever be okay.

But one of the aspects of that statistic is wrong, must be wrong, just out of logical reasoning.

Certain antibotics, when given in low, sub-therapeutic doses, are known to improve feed conversion efficiency (more output, such as muscle or milk, for a given amount of feed) and may promote greater growth, most likely by affecting gut flora.

https://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/growth-promotants-and-production-enhancers/antimicrobial-feed-additives

According to the National Office of Animal Health (NOAH, 2001), antibiotic growth promoters are used to ""help growing animals digest their food more efficiently, get maximum benefit from it and allow them to develop into strong and healthy individuals"". Although the mechanism underpinning their action is unclear, it is believed that the antibiotics suppress sensitive populations of bacteria in the intestines. It has been estimated that as much as 6 per cent of the net energy in the pig diet could be lost due to microbial fermentation in the intestine (Jensen, 1998). If the microbial population could be better controlled, it is possible that the lost energy could be diverted to growth.

436	"I notice the numbers seem to change depending on who is arguing for them so let's take a look at 2017 in the U.S.! 77 of the 32,000 estimated deaths are pediatric deaths that year, that is .2% not even 1% ..... .2. Now 80% may seem like a scary number until you realize how small that number is and quite frankly, if their immune system was compromised to a point where complications following the flu killed them... chances are the minor symptoms the vaccine can give you with a compromised immune system would have triggered those complications anyway.

 Polio is 100% effective if given the four doses that you are supposed to receive, even just one dose is 90%, two is 99%, three is 100%, four is just to be sure really. The flu vaccine itself is usually only 25% effective, though that depends on the strain and the year. I've done my research, I don't believe I'm misinformed here. Now the elderly are the ones that we really need to be concerned about, but again they have weaker immune systems so whether or not the vaccine would do them any good at that point (where they are susceptible to pneumonia etc.) is highly debatable.  

Also, no, the U.S. is over-medicated in general, antibiotics being a big culprit too. Have a sinus infection? Most of the time a doctor will immediately prescribe antibiotics. This is how drug resistant bugs happen, MRSA is a big result of this, antibiotic resistant gonorrhea being another well known one. I've had mrsa infection as a result of being in the hospital where it thrives, ironically, and it is not something I would care to repeat. "	Ah, yes... Reagan's big scary trope.

We deal with Chinese shippers all day every day in my business and the scams and tricks they pull to evade import or export restrictions or customs duties is astounding.

Like, either:

A) He really believes this and, for some reason feels entitled to a very specific type of girl (what type that is I can't say, since ""better looking"" is so subjective) and legitimately feels that you don't measure up, meaning that he's more or less keeping you around until this mythical ""better"" girl appears and gives him the time of day and relationship he feels he deserves. Thus, he is a useless shithead who doesn't see women as people and is okay with treating people as disposable placeholders until he gets what he ""really"" wants.

or

B) He is saying these things specifically to break you down, because he wants you to feel like you're less than in the relationship and thus put you on the defensive, so you feel like you're afraid of him walking away whenever this mythical ""better looking"" woman suddenly appears and for some reason becomes entranced by... his shitty personality and misogyny, I guess? He wants you to feel like you're never going to measure up so that you are always feeling obligated to fight and claw and compromise to 'win' his affection, so that you'll bend over backwards to give him whatever he wants because he has you so broken down and afraid of him abandoning you. This is why he'll always find something new to criticize you about, and ESPECIALLY why he's targeting *very specifically* the achievement you were feeling so good about - the fact that he specifically called out the pull-ups, a goal that you achieved and a reason you were feeling good about yourself, as the point when your ""new"" ugliness appeared... he knows exactly what the fuck he's doing.

Honestly, OP, I expect it's a blend of both. He's a misogynist shithead who feels he's entitled to women, and he's an abusive shithead who is blatantly breaking you down to try and make you feel like a) you can't do better than him b) you 'owe' him for 'settling' for you and c) anything that makes you feel good or proud or secure is actually bad.

If he was *really* concerned about having a skewed expectation of women due to porn and fraternity norms, that's HIS problem to solve via therapy. If he actually cared about anyone but himself, he would WANT to change this skewed perception that has caused him to repeatedly hurt someone he supposedly loves.

"I think your ""only reason to invade the EU reason"" is wrong, and I hope you can understand my explanation and why that may be the case.

To get to the point, you can't take control of another countries military presence unless you literally absorb said presence and units by absorbing their government. Obviously, no one is absorbing the US anytime soon.

Society another country has a military presence somewhere, your choices are to get them to remove it, wait for them to remove it, or eliminate it. As you stated, one would not want to invade the EU for their natural resources but their productivity and stability, both which would be eliminated following an invasion. So that third way of eliminating a military presence is out. 

So then there's just convincing or waiting, neither which involve an invasion. So your reasoning doesn't really line up. 

Now, are there actually other reasons to invade? Sure. Many. But that's not my point here. My point is only that you would not invade a country to control their presence, you'd invade a country to replace or eliminate someone else's military presence. "	asoiaf	worldnews	-1

You know about the GFC in 2008\-2009 well that went around the world \- and the consequence of it was the people stopped buying stuff \- just STUFF. So who did that impact ? The people who make all the STUFF \- China.

So while the US, UK and EU pumped TRILLIONS into their BANKS via quantative easing \- Australia engaged in Keynsian stimulus \- instead of putting money into the banks it was put into the pockets of workers in order to get the credit creation process going (money in the hands of workers is spent \- in the hands of banks it increases asset prices) \- pink batts, school building capital building funds, first home buyer grants.

In a similar manner China also stimulated  \- but instead of Australia's $80 Billion \- China injected close to a TRILLION US DOLLARS into their economy \- this was also aimed at building \- namely housing and apartment construction. This is the single largest injection into any economy \- ever. It was absolutely MASSIVE. It ended up being close to 3 Trillion.

Anyway \- that went directly into demand for STEEL to built with. To make steel you need coal and iron ore. That meant Australia needed to supply it \- so two things happened.

Money FLOODED into Australia to build the mines, ports, railways, roads, freeways, ships, terminals, etc \- that demand for Australian dollars (this is needed) for what is called CAPEX \- CAPITAL EXPENDITURE from direct foreign investment and domestic \- drove the dollar through the roof.

As an aside our car industry was amongst the most competitive in the world \- all nations, all car companies are subsidised \- so prior to the dollar hitting $1:15 we were amongst he most competitive \- in that two year window of high AUD the LNP shut down every car company in Australia \- along with most of our manufacturing because ITS UNIONIZED.

Now the AUD is likely heading back down to well below 60 cents. It has hovered at 70\-80 cents due to foreign reserve bank demand at the SPREAD between our high interest rates and foreign interest rates as we have a AAA\+ credit rating, plus continued commodity demand.

In the time since 2009 we have pumped our debt levels to the worlds highest and are therefore staring at a systemic collapse in our currency \- which means paying that debt back will cripple our economy and deny us the ability to continue to borrow and destroy our credit rating.

We are completely and utterly fucked \- and no longer have any manufacturing industries to claw our way out of debt \- these industries took 150 years to create \- two years to destroy.

And fucking morons on this sub continue to claim shutting down our manufacturing was a good thing because SUBSIDIES.

And can they all get time off work to go to another part of the country for an extended period of time for treatment? No? Oh, hmm, I wonder if that affects access to these institutions.

&gt;And the majority live near world class institutions.

Citation?

&gt;Every major city has world class institutions.

No, every major city has hospitals. They're not all world class. Come on, seriously?

&gt;Suggesting that a small privileged minority is the only group getting care at these hospitals is absurd.

"Have you gone unemployed or somehow spent significant time not working in a situation that was not a vacation? The reason I ask is that I felt like I might have said the same thing as you until I had to test the theory in my own life.

I had to go on medical leave while doing clinical internships in school, which meant that I had about 9 months of downtime with no particular obligations. I was on leave due to significant nerve damage in one arm, so the first 1.5 months was mostly spent at home due to severe pain and the haziness of combined sleep deprivation and constant pain meds. After that, I had all this time and found it very hard to fill.

I’d get up at a normal time, go spend a lot of time at the gym most days, and then come home and go “Ok, now what?”. I did a lot of hiking, I went on long drives, played all the video games I wanted, and read lots of books. I play the piano, and I was able to devote some time to that as well, and I had the cleanest car known to man thanks to lots of time spent detailing it to the degree that probably suggests obsessive tendencies. With all that, I was still left with a lot of free time. I was staying with my folks since I didn’t want to keep paying rent in the city where I went to school, so I would have maybe taken up some sort of time consuming hobby like woodworking but I couldn’t exactly set up shop in their garage. 

When you remove work from the equation, you are left with an amount of time to fill that is sort of hard to fathom until you’re in that situation. I would easily fill my time if I worked less than I do now, but doing that with no work at all is another story. "	Economics	science	-1

533	"One person did this for me when my little brother (4 years younger) was born. They bought me The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I was so excited because I had been learning to read. I actually managed to read it at 4 &amp; a half-5 years old, just out of pure determination (it was my present, after all, and I was damn well gonna enjoy it!). It sparked a lifelong obsession and now I'm studying to teach literature. As a result, I've followed this LPT with all of my friends' kids. It especially helps if it's an activity thing for the kid, since getting a sibling is often the catalyst for a lot more independent play. The eldest child often gets too much attention from mom &amp; dad to the point where it's suffocating...and then it suddenly drops off when they realize their parenting style is unsustainable. I think that an activity-focused gift is a great way to commemorate the rite of passage into entertaining their own damn selves.

I don't remember feeling entitled to the gift. I remember thinking 'huh, that's weird that I would get a present'. But maybe it helps that it wasn't presented in an appeasing way. It was more of a spontaneous 'here, we saw this and thought you'd like it' gift, which are the best kind of presents. I also don't remember it setting an expectation, because i knew it was a one-off and didn't think I would get stuff on other important occasions.

For people who think this will spoil a child, remember that you can always just get a couple of toys suitable for multiple ages. You don't have to make it explicitly FOR the older kid.

547	It's more beneficial to take new debts with good conditions to pay for old loans with worse conditions. Because money is 'cheaper' nowadays as far as i know	"This is a double edged sword that has a simple solution.

It's double edged because consumer debt is a **very bad thing** for economies. Economies based on consumer debt fail hard and fast within a generation. Guess what's happening as we speak? Yeah, this has historical precedent (although, this time is so much worse because it's a global, not local phenomenon). History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme.

It's also double edged because high liquidity and loans are the lifeblood of modern (Read: post 1800) economies. Done *sanely*, having access to loans means businesses are easier to get started. Since 99% of buisnesses fail, making it easy to start a business is in the macro sense a very good idea. Problem today is, *we don't do anything remotely approaching sanity.* Businesses nowadays take loans to repurchase stocks and pay off old loans. Nowhere in that previous sentence does anything actually increase their revenue, and that means they are entirely incapable of repaying this debt without cuts they'd never want to implement (dividend cut would defeat the purpose of the stock repurchases, who the heck will cut their own salary, and cutting workers rarely leads to direct revenue increases). It's a ticket to insolvency.

So, consumer loans are poison, corporate loans are a necessity, but sanity is required for both. How can this be solved without banks? Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Yes, you will need someone to orchestrate it (and you can call that a ""bank""), but doing what LendingClub or any of its comepetitors did on a larger scale would be a simple solution that would also democratize loans (that is, let even the poor get a fair chunk of the massive profits that at the moment are reserved for banks and banks alone)."	worldnews	Bitcoin	-1

590	"I think this is a genuinely interesting photograph, quite possibly a historical one. It *does* tell a story. But just like many other famous photograph, the story is a complete fabrication. Looking at the picture, you see a furious man surrounded by a group of disgusted women staring at him. An observer will assume that they're disgusted at him, when in reality, they're his relatives and they're there to *support* him. They're disgusted by the same thing that's making him angry.

Remember how the Times darkened [OJ's arrest photo](http://www.arogundade.com/oj-simpson-murder-trial-case-time-and-newsweek-magazine-cover-controversy-1994-oj-simpson-photo-manipulation.html), making him appear to have a five o'clock shade and giving him a menacing look? That's a pretty clear cut example of a major news source altering a photograph to make it fit better with their narrative.

In the OJ case, the times actually edited the photo in order to create the lie. This case is much more interesting, because the lie was created through careful photo composition by a skilled photographer.

* The photographer needed to take the picture from an angle where he was completely surrounded by women. Note how most of the men in the picture are blocked by the heads of the women, making it appear like almost everyone in his vicinity are female.
* Obviously, the photographer needed to catch a moment where Kavanaugh was railing and screaming. Based on videos of this hearing, it seems that was not hard to do. This is a bit of an own goal when it comes to controlling the media narrative.
* To further tell *his* story, the photographer needed to take a snapshot at a moment when the women where looking furious at the same time as they're looking at Kavanaugh. I'm guessing the photographer sifted through thousands of shot shots to find this moment.
* One subtle detail that I think a lot of people miss is that except for Kavanaugh, the men pictured here have a very neutral expression. This furthers the impression that Kavanaugh is saying something deeply offensive to women, but once again, it's actually just a carefully chosen photograph. I really believe that this is one of the most important reasons why this picture is so powerful.

My conclusion is that it's pretty obvious the Kavanaugh was trying to control the media narrative by placing his own female relatives around him during this hearing. His attempt backfired miserably as this photographer managed to twist the narrative into the exact opposite through some truly impressive skill.

Very powerful stuff."	So somewhere out there is a narrative where ripping kids from their families and traumatizing them is a good thing?  I don't think so.	photography	politics	-1

All that said, I frankly don't feel all of that has an especially significant impact on drug development. The fact is, pharmaceuticals follow the money like everyone else. Having worked in the medical field, I would honestly say there's *more* of a trend to develop and market things for women right now, as this is seen as highly profitable.

So, this is probably not the answer you want, but the state of birth control is mostly to do with regulatory context over time and  the level of development in the drugs. I don't deny that cultural issues surrounding birth control exist (they absolutely do), I simply think they aren't the driving forces behind what you're observing.

but somewhere around O-5, they might slip up and lose their temper once and yell. and then that junior person is like 'oh shit!' and the thing gets done right quick. and the O-5 is like, 'hey, that was pretty neat!' and they try it again. and again. and again. and by the time theyre make O-6, theyve become a full on tyrant. they couldnt use their old leadership skills anymore even if they wanted to, which they dont. the only thing they have left is their hammer. and when thats all youve got, everything is a nail."	baseball	todayilearned	-1

664	"&gt;Solar roads seem like a terrible idea to me, what is the point in exposing solar panels to all that dirt and having trucks drive over them. 

""Glass"" is a huge field of materials science, and it turns out that you can make glass that is both more durable and less slippery than asphalt. A successful solar roadway is one that wouldn't need to be maintained as frequently as normal roadways, thus saving maintenance (and hopefully money).

Also, how often do you see roads covered with an opaque layer of dirt? Most roads are exposed to the sun most of the time. Even if they are dusty or grimy, the idea of solar roadways is that because they are such an economy of scale, reduced efficiency isn't that much of a detriment. Think of the articles on solar windows that pop up every now and then. It doesn't matter that they'd produce 10% the electricity of a dedicated solar panel, because if every equator-facing window of every skyscraper was producing *some* electricity, it'd be huge.

&gt; Plus roads are often shaded by vehicles and buildings. Plus to clean/replace them you have to close the road.

Some of the early research into solar roadways showed that even during bumper to bumper traffic, the amount of time a road surface is shielded from the sun is only like 50%. And that kind of traffic only occurs during a short part of the day.

&gt;Seriously can anybody explain why you wouldn't just put the panels somewhere better?

Solar roads bring up a bunch of interesting side benefits. In moderately cold areas, they can have heating elements which produce enough heat to prevent build up. Solar roads are also usually proposed as being covered in LEDs. When severe tile damage occurs (think pothole), they could highlight it. Traffic lines could be literally illuminated at night, improving safety. Since they're networked, the entire road system could be used to deliver road closure or detour messages. Since they're all interconnected and powered, they could also be designed to replace long runs of low-voltage overhead powerlines and telecommunication lines.

Problem is, they're a totally new concept that has state-of-the-art engineering challenges in materials science, electric microgrid research, and at the end of the day, cost. Nevertheless, I think the concept is sufficiently grounded in current technology to warrant research. Just don't expect them any time in the near future, and also don't be surprised if it's simply impossible to implement at a reasonable cost, ever."

This is *exactly* saving face. I didn’t say explicitly it was Disney, although that is the case. I said they did it to save face, and they did, for Disney and Star Wars, and by demand. Saving face = protecting brand, brand = Star Wars. EA structured that garbage the way they did because they figured they’d get away with it (and they practically did), but I think it’s also safe to say that they’d have a larger and more consistent playerbase with a F2P game instead of charging $60.

 Jim Sterling is just repeating the same thoughts I’ve had about the future of the game industry that I’ve had since I pondered while sorting the game wall in my time as a GA at Gamestop. Digital Distribution was “the future” back then in 2008, and now it’s just reality. What Jim says about physical games being just a novelty at this point is entirely true. I buy physical games when they are cartridges for Nintendo systems. That’s it. My Xbox, PS4 and PC are all DL only. Within the last 10 years, Gamestop has transformed into a toy store with devices and hardware and customer loyalty as their main sources of income. They sell shirts and Mega Bloks and mugs now. They *print out your game purchases on reciepts*, and their trade business has been in such decline that they’ve resorted to taking in old vintage games again. I warned my manager it would happen, and within 4 years he was laid off because the company made sweeping cuts. It’s a result of a business model that aided in its own destruction by hurting developers by recycling games around a parasitic “circle of life”. I watched people trade in games for $15 store credit, we’d turn around and sell it for $55, and the next guy in line would buy it, when in reality the customers could have cut a deal with each other for $30 and both walked away twice as happy. /rant

Point is, the $60 game structure is entirely a relic of the past. They should reconsider it.

But hell, i’d pay $60 for a damn good single player campaign.

EDIT: Obviously by “they should reconsider the price point” I’m talking about the developers, not Gamestop. I’m well aware of who sets the price points. My point going into talking about Gamestop was to reflect on the industry *as a whole* and how it has changed in terms of distribution.

During the 1980s, I heard it, and fascism, used all the time to describe Thatcher. During the 2000s, it was used occasionally to describe Bush, whose only connection he has is that technically he broke one of the four Nuremberg charges (I think with hindsight we can all agree his administration engaged in ""conspiracy to wage war"", but that this, by itself, is unfortunately common throughout history and wasn't unique to the German Nazi government.) Meanwhile I've heard Internet libertarians use the term to describe any attempt to limit speech or impose restrictions on anyone since the 1990s.

It's only recently I've heard it used almost always to describe people who probably deserve that label.

Long Acting: The older long acting variants have to be taken multiple times a day instead of just once, and they have a peak, while lantus is flat.  This means you'll have to eat at specific times in order to prevent low blood sugars.    Scheduled meals vs. the freedom to eat at will.

"A lot of the reason for the heavy weight given to such an old piece of writing is that the bill of rights portion was created to reflect a set of rights that were to be recognized by the new government being formed, but not granted by that government. Simply recognized as rights that man has always had, granted by his creator and in the past frequently infringed upon by existing systems of government at the time.  

The founders were trying to avoid the flaws of other countries at that time were prone to exhibiting.  They saw tendencies for example, of democracy to turn into tyranny of the majority against rights of the individual and when founding the United States sought to make that impossible. 

The key difference in philosophy is that they were founding a system of government that distrusted government. They recognized that a government will inherently try to infringe upon individual rights, and sought to strike a balance that created a government that had as little power to do so as possible while still maintaining something of a cohesive nation capable of repelling outside attack and also being possible for the citizens to overthrow should it stray too far from the original intent.

732	"In Defense Of The Division

The Division is a good example of a game being released in a lackluster state and continued to improve with patches and expansions. While there is the argument that they should have got the game correct upon release, that isn’t always the case. There’s many factors that go into game development and I generally find it good to see a developer continually work towards improving their product. 

The main game has a very interesting concept and initial cut scene that helps set the stage and tone of the game. Visual imagery helps sell the environment and story. The story missions are forward moving and engaging missions. There’s urgency mixed with intensity and they are great to play. 

The additional dlcs helped to further the game, with the standout being Survival. Most dlcs add to the existing gameplay and rarely do they make you fundamentally think differently than the main game. Survival takes existing systems and changes how think about them. You need to consider different monitoring levels with food, water, temperature and virus levels. As you explore the city you’ll make decisions on whether you should engage enemies or avoid them until you have better equipment. Depending on the server you’re on you’ll develop uneasy alliances with other random players. 

The Division made great efforts to better their game. With the sequel on the horizon I hope they take what they have built and learned and apply that to the sequel. They have the foundation to make a sequel that outdoes its first game. The sequel also has the benefit of learning from its contemporaries like Destiny 2 and not make the same mistakes. The Division 1 grew into a very memorable experience, The Division 2 can continue and surpass that growth.

You make enough to get by but it’s a struggle. You have a wife, so you’re not incel or too far gone, but you feel attacked by identity politics and would never have voted for a woman candidate. You are deeply enough embedded in gun and conspiracy culture that you have disdain for the police and government, think their intrusions are a big problem and if not directly targeting you, you’ve seen enough run ins that you don’t like what you see. When youre mad, your rhetoric gets very dangerous- you advocated shooting police officers families. My guess is you’re a Trump supporter from a rust belt state- Michigan / PA / Wisconsin. Late 20s to early 30s. Slightly younger than me but not ba much. I would assume you CC if it’s legal. I read your last page or two of posts to see if my instincts were right. Your word choice / diction, and often flawed logical constructions make me know you didn’t go to an ivy, don’t have a post graduate degree, and don’t have a trust fund to sit on.

I don’t understand on your focus on attacking men. I don’t think men are under attack because of the shootings. I think guns are under attack because of the shootings. I don’t view or associate manliness with guns.

Manliness is about personal character and approach to the world. A gun is a tool for force projection. A man projects his own force through his presence, statements, and actions. Associating a gun with a man is alien to me.

You tend not to react to what people say but to what you perceive they said as it correlates to a talking point. Above you get into pull yourself up by your bootstraps as a talking point, but I don’t believe in that and did not suggest that. That’s nonsense and not possible.

You also questioned the Russian attack on our elections as propaganda by people with a motive. You denied these as facts several months ago. The problem is they were fact then, and now with Muellers indictment we know even more about what happened. That a campaign like that wouldn’t flip 40,000 votes in the three states that mattered is untenable. Either Facebook and Google advertising is worthless, or the Russians flipped the election. And this is without further results about other parts of the investigation. We know CozyBear and FanfyBear are Russian operations, but you probably don’t believe that either.

What this all gets to is that I’m not unsympathetic to your underlying complaint.

I don’t think it’s all that surprising that disaffected young males with no real future, no real opportunity, and no societal support network lash out. It’s not even all that “crazy” from how we use those words traditionally. It’s not like they’ve lost contact with reality and rationality. It’s that they exist in a society which doesn’t care about them and they uestion the moral imperative to care about everyone else. This is sadly rational.

But the problem is society caring more isn’t a fix. The jobs aren’t coming back. Everything Trymp has promised is a lie. Unless we stop automation vast swaths of this country will be unemployed. We hadn’t had a major war in 70 years so you have all these extra people who would have died or found social advancement on the battle field.

Now you need education, connections, or money. And if you don’t have those there isn’t a way up. Period.

But the narrative hasn’t changed- everyone is still told to West young man. Write a new app. Code something. Do x do y. But there’s no real opportunity and if I didn’t have a great brain, live in NYC, get the best private education in the US, followed by an ivy, I might be in the same position as so many young men throughout this country who simply don’t know what to do.

Automation makes that worse. Human labor is worthless now. You are competing against a machine that doesn’t get sick or tired or need money to support a family. There’s no competitikn.

We can solve some poverty and starvation through a minimum basic income, but that doesn’t solve a mans need for a purpose.

Most people don’t want government money, they want a job they can go to, come home and put food on the table, and watch TV with the wife and go to poker night on thursdays and have a bbq on the weekend.

But that’s not the world anymore. And I don’t want to change where the world is going. My priority is getting us off this rock and figuring out how to make us immortal.

So the solution is to take all the guns, so we raise the barrier of entry above what is realistic for your average school shooter, so that by the time they have the means to carry something out and are working the underground networks, we know who they are and they trip so many red flags we stop them.

White men have to deal with the fact that we have to compete with women and minorities and the rest of the world for jobs and money and success.

That is not an attack on masculinity, it’s a redefinition of ethics. And viewing it as an attack on masculinity is problematic. Because white males have fucked everyone else over for so long that when you bring this up you look ridiculous. The issue is really that it’s rich white makes that got all the winnings, and social media now gives everyone a voice and poor white males are combined in the readjustment against rich white males.

The complaint isn’t necessarily invalid, but it’s very hard to make from a selling your message stand point. And given how unequal the world is and how bad the upper class is; no one cares right now.

To your other points- we do know the regulation would work. It’s worked everywhere else in the world. There is information to comb through, you haven’t looked.

We don’t remove certain people who fall of the tables right to own firearms, we recognize that none of us ever had this right. We take all the guns. And if people like you who like them want to negotiate rather than being intransigent, we could do something like: legislation that limits muzzle velocity / round kinetic energy, cycle rate, effective lethal range. We can have increased penalties and higher mandatory minimums for violations. And we can register, track, and tag all ammunition. This is in addition to obvious restrictions like background checks, doctor evaluations for anyone with mental health issues, and bans for felons and anyone on watch lists.

That’s my middle ground. But until your side wants to discuss that middle ground and no just background checks I’m going to advocate a ban, not incrementalism.

This is a massive wall of text. But you responded in more depth so I thought it’s worth having the conversation with you.

If you find value in firearms, great, I’m glad you have a hobby and a passion. But I want you to understand what it represents to the rest of us and that we live in a society where we’ve all agreed more or less to some terms. And one of those terms is that enough of us agree the rules can change.

I don’t think we ever had the right to privately own guns let alone AR-15s. I think we didn’t want to fund a standing army so there was a good idea of doing it like the Swiss.

I also think we fought a civil war which invalidated a lot of this shit, and we now have a standing army not militias.

I think the placement of a comma matters, and that Arms with a capital was used to refer to Coats of Arms as signaling devices on the battlefield, which are necessary to a well regulated militia. It’s about coordination.

And merchants who aren’t nobles weren’t allowed to bear coats of arms. Meaning if a noble tried to atrack their shit, they couldn’t defend without breaking the law.

This may sound stupid. But you go before the king after and x noble says you were flying your flag and coordinating your guys so we lost when we tried to collect a transit tax, and the King says is this true? And then you lose everything or die.

Are guns fun? Sure.

But there’s no reason the government can’t know every single thing about every round fired in this country.

Is it a risk if someone wants to round up all the gun owners and put them in gulags? Sure?

But if someone wants to kill every gun owner in America, do you really think they need a list? Or that a list will substantively help them?"	The most amazing part of the article is how fast it can make people into experts of the stock market and capital evaluations.	business	technology	-1

Yup it bothers me too that brands are getting away with selling poor quality stuff just because it has their name stitched on it, with many of the perception Factory inventory is equivalent to mainline.

However, the market will course-correct. These brands abusing factory/outlet branding will learn the hard way what consumers are going to think of their products in the long-run.

809	"&gt;A low dollar is usually considered good for natural resource exporters. Your workers are paid using the cheaper currency, while your buyers get more bang for their buck making your product look like a comparatively good deal.

The low dollar helps manufacturing and exports to some extent, but it's a temporary bandaid that may hurt long-term development more than it helps. Technology purchased from the US and overseas becomes more expensive, so companies have less ability to invest in modernizing their production line. It also becomes increasingly difficult to retain mobile high tech talent because the low dollar magnifies the salary differential, which makes establishing, growing, and retaining companies in the ""new economy"" that everyone talks about wanting to build more difficult. 

And if the dollar dips below historical lows (which it may well, given the significant drop in FDI over the last three years and the increasing sense that Canada is a place where capital investment goes to die), it's inevitable that our standard of living will drop as costs for imported things like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment become more expensive. (A lot of us are starting to feel this on a micro level; I have some personal projects on the side that could eventually be profitable, but as costs rise, whether it's even worth it becomes harder to justify to my wife.) Resources industries may increasingly be seen as undesirable to many, but they do help to support the way of life we've become accustomed to, and provide the financial resources to diversify into new areas. They also provide jobs for segments of the population that may not be wholesale retrainable for high tech jobs, even if there was the volume of jobs to accommodate them."

"	"So I got it the wrong way, it was BA who were doing the stealing. Basically, Virgin and BA shared an IT system and BA got staff who had legitimate access to other airline’s data on that system to extract sensitive data. This included load factors (how many people board a flight) which are crucial to running an airline efficiently. The staff they used were those who help customers transfer flights on to different airlines (so you may fly Glasgow to Gatwick on BA and then Gatwick to JFK on Virgin) hence needing access to data. Virgin was quite small at the time and suffered from delays. The people who had access to the Virgin data would share this data with a separate team who would target people transiting to try and get them to change their flight to BA. They would also apparently lie and claim a Virgin flights were delayed/cancelled and offer BA flights as an alternative. 

By most accounts they were specifically targeting high revenue customers who were connecting on to Virgin Upper Class (Business Class, Virgin Atlantic doesn’t offer First Class) by gathering their contact details, flight schedules etc.  It ended up costing BA millions in fines and compensation.

817	"P is the class of ""Decision problems solvable in polynomial-time by a turing machine"".
The extended church-turing thesis posits that there's at most a polynomial slowdown depending on your model of computation (given that it's ""reasonable""), whcih means that:

""P is the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial-time""

Generally, for something like knapsack is made into a decision problem by giving it another input, T, and having the decision problem you're solving be:

""Given this collection of items `collection`, and this threshold `T`, is there a 'knapsack' with total value T or more?"".
You could then binary search on the value of T to find when this switches from ""Yes' to ""No"", which is essentially the optimization version.

The existence of approximation algorithms is in some sense orthogonal to our discussion of whether a problem is in P or not.
There are NP-complete problems that are quite easy to approximate provably well (knapsack), and NP-complete problems that are horrendous (general Travelling salesman).

In practice, knowing a problem is in NP can be useful because it can give you a hint that the problem doesn't really scale (generally).
If you want to solve a NP-hard problem in ""large scales"", you'll have to start looking elsewhere (maybe related problems are easier and good enough for your uses).

One ""other place"" you can look into is approximation algorithms.
Along this ""different axis"", you might see that knapsack is 'easy', travelling salesman is 'hard', but certain special cases of travelling salesman (the underlying graph being literal cities and paths connecting them expressing the distance) can be much easier --- what before we couldn't have an a(n)-approximation for (for any poly-time computable a(n)), we now have a 2-approximation for.

So, you're right that being easily (provably well) approximated isn't the same as being in P or NP, but it's still a property we want to look into when explicitly solving a problem is computationally too difficult.
These aren't considered solutions to the *decision problem* that underlies a problem being in P or NP, but it's not like they aren't valid algorithms with valid results --- it's just their results are *different* than what might be considered the ""norm"", so should be interpreted differently."

818	"I honestly can’t believe you still deny this. The example I gave you is nearly as simple as 1+1 = 2.

Edit: /u/politisch_inkorrekt, I received a notification that you replied, but it looks like your comment isn’t showing up for some reason. However, I can see what you wrote in your comment history:

&gt; Which pretty much sums it up, thinking that sociological problems are solved by something as simple as addition.

Again, let’s look at this incredibly simple example:

**Scenario 1:**

- 25% of teachers are good teachers. 

- A school has 10 positions available.

- 20 teachers apply. 

In this scenario, here is the best the school can do:

- Good teachers hired: 5

- Bad teachers hired: 5

Since 25% of teachers are good teachers and only 20 apply, then only 5 are good teachers. The school can’t hire more good teachers than apply!

**Scenario 2;**

- 25% of teachers are good teachers. 

- A school has 10 positions available.

- 100 teachers apply. 

In this scenario, here is the best the school can do:

- Good teachers hired: 10

- Bad teachers hired: 0

Since 25% of teachers are good teachers and 100 apply, there are 25 good teachers, which is plenty for the available number of positions! Again, **the only difference here is the total number of applicants**. This shows that the larger the applicant pool, the more good teachers there will be for the available positions, *regardless of whether the percentage of good teachers increases*. 

The only way the school would still only hire 5 good teachers and 5 bad teachers would be if they were selected *at random*. This is *not* how the interview process works. "	"Teachers work more than the hours that students are in school. They’re expected to show up to school an hour early and often stay 3-5 hours afterwards for meetings, answering emails, planning curriculums, grading, parent teacher conferences and more. 

The estimated work time is 12-15 hours a day for the majority of teachers in the US. That’s 5 days a week. 

They also have to prep during summer time and still attend meetings. 

They’re also expected to buy many of the supplies that will be used by children - many spending $500 to $1000 a year. 

The pay for primary education teachers in Oklahoma ranges from 31k to 46k. 

That’s after they (normally) put themselves in significant debt in order to get the degree that’s required for their profession.

If it really DID 'copy the device's memory' then brute-forcing wouldn't take more than a second for 6 digit pins. Decryption key derivation uses a unique per-device UID key that's stored inside the Secure Enclave and is NOT EXTRACTABLE via software. Were it possible to extract the UID key, the crack would take seconds on a GPU cluster. Instead, each PIN attempt has to use actual Secure Enclave hardware to be able to use the UID in a way that, given the right PIN, would produce the master decryption key. Moreover, the amount of 'rounds' of crypto is calibrated so that one attempt takes about 200ms - and actual brute-forcing takes longer than than, from the data we have available - which allows us to conclude that the key is still on the device."

Everything that Harvey said, can be repeated verbatim by just about every Chicago male that I know. In fact, this isn't about Harvey really being wrong, it's about how he doesn't conform to modern day's ubiquitous view that everyone is equal and should be treated the same. When presented with a famous black male's point of view that doesn't confirm this viewpoint, he gets ostracized. Which is bullshit. Honestly it is. We are forcefed bullshit agendas by the media and now it is so much a part of us, that you can't be different the other direction (I don't know how to underline but that last part is important).

I actually managed to read it at 4 &amp; a half-5 years old, just out of pure determination (it was my present, after all, and I was damn well gonna enjoy it!). It sparked a lifelong obsession and now I'm studying to teach literature. As a result, I've followed this LPT with all of my friends' kids. It especially helps if it's an activity thing for the kid, since getting a sibling is often the catalyst for a lot more independent play. The eldest child often gets too much attention from mom &amp; dad to the point where it's suffocating...and then it suddenly drops off when they realize their parenting style is unsustainable. I think that an activity-focused gift is a great way to commemorate the rite of passage into entertaining their own damn selves.

I don't remember feeling entitled to the gift. I remember thinking 'huh, that's weird that I would get a present'. But maybe it helps that it wasn't presented in an appeasing way. It was more of a spontaneous 'here, we saw this and thought you'd like it' gift, which are the best kind of presents.

883	"Tbh, and I hope you think about this carefully: if you were a pharmaceutical company CEO, would you develop drugs that didn't have IP protection? Keep in mind you have to compensate the cost of dozens of drugs that didn't make it through phase 3 clinical trials to market.

There's a reason drug costs are high in the US, I believe it lies closer towards our payer system than our IP system. There's also nothing to say the government shouldn't more aggressively subsidize drugs for key diseases or take particular action in the case of rare diseases or cases in which a cure is truly exclusive for a life-threatening illness. Our payer system offers little negotiating advantage in these key scenarios; a life-saving cure might get FDA fast track approval but doesn't necessarily reach patients at a cheaper cost.

But to say that the US pharma industry isn't the peak of pharmaceutical development in the world is laughable. The facts suggest that our current system puts out the most possible new drugs in the least time. The questions: is this truly worth it to the consumer if they are bankrupted for a slightly more up-to-date cure? How can we protect vulnerable patient groups with life-threatening illnesses with few available options? Are there means to distribute costs efficiently such that failed clinical trials do not force exorbitantly high costs down the road?

Anyone who thinks this solution is simple, that we can preserve the rate of pharmaceutical discovery while easily keeping patient costs in control is sadly mistaken. Such a balance would require a huge overhaul of our health care system and a definitive investment of our budget. (Neither of which I am opposed to.)"

You could absolutely say the 'cloverfield' aspect was tacked on but it was just as shoe horned in '10 lane' and that movie was fantastic. I think this movie gave you just enough info for speculation and theories for how everything connects but idk why anyone would expect concrete connections even with the deceptive trailer. I thought this movie was great first watch, guess I will give it another go round. 	MensRights	movies	-1
893	I was educated in Canada and recently had a conversation about the topics covered in my science labs with an American.  First they were puzzled and I was having a hard time understanding why until I learned they never even got to do labs in the science classes. Like they never learned titration in chemistry before leaving high school, or dissected an animal in biology.  Or fucking used a scale, balance, or a bowl of water to learn about weight, mass, or volume in physics.	"Fun fact: 
If you put a certain chemical (iodine I believe but I'm not 100% sure) into their tanks you can actually force them to evolve essentially. 
Axolotls are ""stuck"" in what most other amphibians would call their adolescent stage. They don't have lungs, they have gills, and require staying in the water. 
However after you introduce a chemical into their environment the axolotl can be observed to lose it's gills, grow lungs , and even change color to resemble an adult newt. 
It really blew my mind when I found out about that 
Not only do they look like a Pokemon but shit, you can force evolve them like one too. "	technology	todayilearned	-1

It makes feed more efficient (less food to feed the animals), thus the incentive is it is cheaper to raise animals. **The bacteria it is killing that results in growth is not pathenogenic.** It's just natural gut flora that would be present during natural development. Killing it **promotes growth beyond a natural level**.

The human analogy is that if you put small doses of certain antibiotics in your food, you'd have to eat less calories or you would gain weight. I'm not saying this is true, because a human diet is very different, but it's an analogy."	IAmA	askscience	-1

"The issue is in order for discipline to be effective the education system would need to show some investment in children as individuals. That onus is always handed down to teachers though, which is difficult when promoting growth, exploration, individuality, and autonomy is in direct juxtaposition with the “shut up and do your work” idea— one that permeates our culture not only in education, but in what it means for us to be valued citizens. It’s not hard to understand how all of this is polarizing.  Schools are worker production plants for some, and quarantine zone for others, who don’t have family that isn’t too busy for them, that don’t have a community looking out for them (which is the norm for nearly all kids, most notably teenagers, in our culture. Not the exception). 

not saying we shouldn’t discipline more and more effectively to create safer environments but this isn’t just a couple of bad apples. This is a systemic issue that goes way past how we deal with kids once they’ve broken the rules. Idk I’m just out of school and the one thing I’ve noticed is that the prime difference in well behaved kids and poorly behaved ones is how they react to the indifference offered by an education system that will tolerate anything but failure; sexual violence, harassment, kids having breakdowns in the halls being commonplace. All of these are fine as long as enough kids pass. And the ones who won’t? In my experience these kids already know that, it’s what they’ve been taught. "	hiphopheads	canada	-1

When you start to lose weight, going off the previous logic, the body starts to burn fat in the storage areas deemed least ideal (neck, arms, and wrists just to fire off some examples).

All the speculations at the end are pure FUD:

- We don't know if there will be any regulation, but I'd say it's unlikely because hubs/relays never have control over the funds or knowledge about where a payment is coming from or going to. Also, Bitcoin doesn't have any borders, so you can always use a hub in a country without  regulation.
* We don't even know if hubs will be a thing at all, because they'd need to put large amounts of money into online hot-wallets, and that gets riskier the bigger they are.
* You don't need large channels if you make sure your channels balance out by routing tx in both directions.
* It's an open ecosystem, so anybody who charges unreasonable fees will be pushed out of the market.
* There can be multiple logical and interconnected networks with different topologies (hub-and-spoke, mesh, whatever) on the same LN. Wallets (you!) decide where to connect to and who to route through, so you are free to use or not use hubs, should they emerge.
* A 3rd party monitoring a channel for you knows nothing about that channel other than some keys that can be used to punish a bad actor, but for nothing else.

Game designing is as much an art form as it is a skill, in my opinion, and thus is less demanding than say a financial / executive position where experience / trade-knowledge is a core tenet of success. 

And also, I don't think anyone's advocating Bellular take over WoW's game design lol. I think we are talking about consultation, and improving their feedback / communication machine. I think it would be a productive process to WoW's game design even if it's just passionate, well known pillars of the community as opposed to outside professional help.

My dad bought a 2008 E92 335i a year later, I was always the passenger but nonetheless, it was still awesome. 2-3 years after that, he got a 2011 E92 335i... It was good thing I got my license early, my dad let me daily the E92 for years until my first year in college. 

Another 3 years after that, we got a 2015 F32 435i. Unfortunately, it was involved in an accident. My father was driving at the time and was hit on the passenger rear quarter panel. That thing took the hit like a fucking champ. 

I'll always feel safe in BMWs. I drive an F36 440i now and I love it. I honestly don't think I'm going to switch up on BMW. 

When I start my career I'm hoping to get a CPO F90 M5. 

Another car company I love to death is Porsche.  Specifically any 911 GT3 variant. My dream car.

1024	"""When we launched Twitch Prime we were determined to give streamers and their viewers the best value in gaming. And since then we’ve seen the Twitch community take advantage of Twitch Prime perks like monthly channel subscriptions to support favorite streamers, Free Games with Prime, and in-game loot for games like Fortnite, PUBG, Hearthstone, and more. On top of everything you get through Amazon Prime, this year alone we’ve offered members more than $1,000 worth of games and loot.

As we have continued to add value to Twitch Prime, we have also re-evaluated some of the existing Prime benefits. As a result, we are announcing two changes.

First, universal ad-free viewing will no longer be part of Twitch Prime for new members, starting on September 14. Members with monthly subscriptions will continue to get ad-free viewing until October 15. If you already have an annual subscription, or if you upgrade to an annual subscription before September 14, you will continue with ad-free viewing until your next renewal date.

Advertising is an important source of support for the creators who make Twitch possible. This change will strengthen and expand that advertising opportunity for creators so they can get more support from their viewers for doing what they love. You can read more details on this change in our recent blog post.

Second, starting on August 28, Prime members will now get a $10 Amazon credit when pre-ordering select games on Amazon.com. This credit can be used on almost anything sold by Amazon.com. This new pre-order benefit is replacing the current discount on physical game pre-orders. All eligible pre-orders placed before August 28 will still receive the 20% discount under the existing benefit once the game is released. For more information and restrictions on this new Prime benefit, click right here.

All other Twitch Prime benefits, like monthly channel subs, monthly games and loot, and chat badges are not changing. You can still get channel-specific ad-free viewing as part of Twitch Prime by using your monthly subscription token on a channel that has ad-free viewing for subscribers turned on.

The expendable water filters, minerals, and CO2 all cost; so does the bottled water, but the difference is I can buy the latter at the grocery store. There is also an up-front cost to purchase the equipment -- which is not available at the grocery store. The bottled water is instantly available with no work from me, while I need to wait and plan ahead for a drink made at home. I can throw a 9L pack of water in my car and never purchase a drink away from home. It is far less likely that I will diligently take my single reusable bottle of homemade water with me everywhere I go, nor is it likely that it will hold enough. This is even less practical for my husband due to the realities of his job. 

Furthermore, we don't own our home, we can't install a permanent fancy system. The kind of filters you can use in a pitcher all come in loads of plastic anyway, and I sincerely doubt they're more environmentally efficient on a per-liter basis than the mass filtration the bottling plant would use. To buy these filters, we need to drive 45min away from home! It sounded attractive to us too, but when you consider the practicalities it gets more and more ridiculous. We're not going to switch for now. It may make more sense after our next move, especially if we get stuck somewhere without recycling again. 

As far as I'm concerned, this is our dumb thing. We don't waste money on cable, we don't smoke, we limit packaged products in the rest of our grocery shopping, it's not like we're unconcerned about health, finances, or environment. I agree that bottled water use isn't an ideal choice, but sometimes it irks me that people get so insistent about its evils when other choices people make are arguably worse and those are normalized. I'm sure something you enjoy consuming is not good for your health, your wallet, or the environment, and I'm sure you made a considered choice when you decided you could consume that thing and still keep your values.

1053	"&gt; there used to be (wrong) theories that didn't invoke genetical change over generations

Not so. A proposed explanation for a phenomenon (such as the phenomenon of genetic change over many generations) is called an [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis). In order to merit being called a [scientific theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory) a hypothesis must first survive a great deal of repeated testing. Historical hypotheses other than natural selection, such as [Lamarkism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism), did not survive testing, so it was only ever an hypothesis, never a theory.

&gt; Well, you say that, but one might think that the change of genetics you say is simply ""evolution"" could be a part of the ""theory of evolution""

Perhaps another example might help you. Gravity is the phenomenon which we observe whenever we hold an object above the ground and then let it go the object falls to the ground. The theory of gravity (which is an explanation of how gravity works) is called ""the [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)"".

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.

It should be clear to you that ""gravity"" and ""the general theory of relativity"" are not the same thing.

OK, so is it now clear to you that ""evolution"" and ""the theory of evolution"" are likewise not the same thing?"

It's possible these toys are old, and she doesn't use them often -- or at all, but didn't want to throw them out for fear of having to replace them again later. Also, please do not be intimidated by the size of the toy. Length is the *least* important factor (for all you know, she liked the shape and width of it, but it only came in that size, so she only uses the first four inches. It's also common to buy longer toys for the ""handle"" at the end), and even if it is wider than you, I mean, toys and sex feel *so* different. When you have sex, your not just putting your penis in her vagina, right? You're doing other things -- kissing, rubbing, touching, talking, breathing, grinding, moaning, looking... There's so much more to it. Both partners get way more turned on, ESPECIALLY women, who tend to be very emotionally sexual; for many women, sex is more about making love than fucking. Toys can't make love; they can't tell her how sexy it is when she squeezes that muscle or grinds a certain way; they can't cuddle her afterward, and they certainly can't get her a hot washcloth to clean up with so she doesn't have to get off the bed between sex and pillow talk. As a woman who not only owns close to a hundred different toys and had worked at a sex store for over 3 years, I can tell you that if you're doing it right, toys are NO competition. And if you're not doing it right, you can change that. Part of that change might be to incorporate some of these toys into your sex life; view them as *tools*, not as replacements. Sure, you could build a house with a box of screws and a manual screwdriver... But wouldn't the job get done *better* and *more efficiently* with an electric drill? Wouldn't you be able to build a whole neighborhood in the same time it previously took to build one house -- and not have to deal with the hand fatigue on top of that?? And it's not like the drill is gonna do anything on its own -- it needs someone to use it. So whether it's her hand or yours building these houses/giving her pleasure, the drill/toys are just a more excellent and fun and easy way to get it done."

And we are recreating conditions that existed moments after the universe appeared. Which could have been pretty small depending just how close to the beginning we are talking about.

"	"There is a question of accuracy vs artistic intent. Some photos that have been colorized will simply not have accuracy but artistic intent. While others will have a more accurate reference to the subject's color tone and pallette. 

1. Manual coloring can be simply referencing known color ads, diagrams and notes, personal journals from the time period or guessing based on color trends of the time period.

2. Computerized colorization has come light years ahead through the use of what's called deep learning. The most famous version of image processing comes through the term deep convolutional neural networks or CNN for short. 

Basically you take the pixels from the black and white and look at their assigned values. It's a mathematical spectrum from 0 to 255 with 1 channel. 

You start by looking at a group of the nearest pixels next to the one you're looking at. You do some math on all of these pixels. Then keep sliding over to the pixel next to it. 

This happens as many times as it makes sense. Then it can look at the outputs of all those pixels you just looked at. It does this multiple times as well. 

The intended output would be 3 channels of red, green and blue 0-255 for each for that one specific pixel. 

The computer does this over and over again until it feels it can discern  a pixel's color. 

Now HOW it does it is a matter of debate. If you're looking for artistic value vs accuracy. Accuracy wise you can provide a training set that was colored photos turned black n white. You can then let the computer check it's work over iterations until it's fairly accurate. 

There will still be a lot of variance but that's one way computers do it. I can get deeper but it's actually mathematically heavy and it's not the first neural net you should really learn imo.

I've added some videos that may either help or make it more confusing.

Smart people can be born to parents who choose not to vaccinate them. Smart people can also ineligible for vaccination and reliant upon others to vaccinate, else they have a higher risk of death.

But I don't think the ""dumb/smart"" distinction is at all cut-and-dry, either. You have smart people being misinformed or otherwise cautious or paranoid and therefore skipping vaccines, and you have oblivious people (who you may see as ""dumb"") just doing standard vaccines 'cause whatever, why not?

My goal is to eat 1700 kcals (122g P/125g C/79g F) and I've seen great progress so far but I am having a LOT of trouble hitting those numbers exactly. I feel like I'm eating all day and yet can barely hit 1600kcals. I always hit my protein but struggle with carbs and especially fats. I eat mainly whole foods, don't eat red meat, and no dairy.

Any tips for finding a way to, I guess, eat more? Or maybe foods that don't fill you as much?

Follow up Q: If I'm seeing progress at 1600kcals daily, should I change my macros to that or would that be too low?"	"While I'd like to believe everything said here, I don't think there is any evidence whatsoever to support it. Perhaps you could provide some sources.

Admittedly - and herein lies the rub - I too have little in the way of evidence to support the claim that misconduct is on the *rise*. Although what studies exist (https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/) certainly indicate a steady increase in arrests for police misconduct. You could interpret that data as an *improvement*, I suppose by saying that police committed offenses are more likely to be prosecuted. Hard to say.

That's the issue though, isn't it? We have no truly rigorous, independent system of oversight. Nor do we have transparency. Data on police misconduct is entirely dependent on departments self-reporting and public perception lately seems to be that people are troubled by the lack of such oversight and transparency. 

Of course, it's a bit unsettling to members of the public like myself when just about every single time a department attempts to implement some oversight - take body cameras for example or use independent prosecutors in cases where police are charged - police unions push back with full force. 

You paint a pretty rosy picture here that apparently, police departments across the country are doing just fine self-policing and that we shouldn't be worried about misconduct. I think a substantial portion of the American voting population would disagree with you."	Fitness	AdviceAnimals	-1

1122	"I’ll give it a shot..

The British claimed the area of Palestine following their defeat of the Ottoman Empire in WW1.  In 1948, they abandoned it and a civil war broke out between the Jews and the Arabs living there.   Egypt came to the aid of the Arabs and captured the Gaza Strip.  In 1967, Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and occupied it offering to trade it back in peace negotiations.  Egypt refused negotiations and Israel built  couple settlements there.  In 1979, they did negotiate a peace treaty but Egypt abandoned its claim to the territory, leaving the inhabitants stateless and occupied by Israel.  In 2005, Israel abandoned its settlements in the Gaza Strip and completely removed their army and turned it over to the Palestinian government.  In 2006, Hamas, a terrorist organization with a political arm, violently took control of the Strip from the opposing Palestinian faction.   In response, Israel blockaded  all but humanitarian items from entering the strip; this blockade has been eased over the years to only include items with military use.  Two or three wars have broken out when Hamas fires hundred of missiles at Israeli towns.  Many Gaza Strip civilians are killed when Israel responds until they get an agreement from Hamas to stop firing missiles.  It’s been four years since the last war, there have been some missiles but not many.  Israel and the world has offered enormous aid and infrastructure if Hamas agrees to disarm, abandon their declared war and turn power back over to the recognized Palestinian government but they refuse.

This week, the Hamas leadership has encouraged thousands of people to demonstrate at the border and demand to be let into Israel.   Most demonstrators are a distance from the actual border fence but many, usually young men, keep approaching the fence to sling rocks, Molotov cocktails, and burning tires at the soldiers on the other side.  These are met with rubber bullets from the soldiers.  If they get too close to crossing the border or damage the fence, they are likely met with real bullets.  Israel is acting probably with a lot more restraint than any other country would.  Imagine a country that has declared war on you sending thousands of their civilians to try and cross the border, they are doing so with the sole goal of trying to get their Palestinian citizens killed. Mission accomplished."	Good thing technology made it affordable for all of us.

As to our old quarrel about the clause Filioque, it will clearly have disappeared at the time of which we speak: for, as tradition avers that the Apostles, when they first formed a creed, did not all profess it together, but each supplied his contribution, Peter leading the way with I believe in God, so in this new Church nobody will be expected to recite the whole creed, but only such clauses as he finds relish in; it being anticipated that, with good fortune, a large congregation will usually manage in this way to recite the whole formula between them.

Although my favourite bit is shortly after that...

&gt;Thus it may be hoped we shall complete the reunion of all Christians; the considerations so far brought forward are so obvious and plain to all men of sense that I am well-nigh ashamed to have dwelt so long upon them; the question to be raised in the present treatise is rather, whether we do right to confine these beneficent operations to the Christian or Trinitarian sects only, or whether we cannot advantageously extend them to other religious systems which have, till now, from a lack of proper reflection, been held to be incompatible with Christianity. And here I do not refer to the Unitarians; for it is to be feared that if these persons have gone out of their way to separate themselves from the other sects on the ground of a doctrine so little taught in our Church, and so little believed in, as that of the Trinity, they must be a pettifogging, cantankerous set of fellows, that prize their own opinions too highly, to become parties to our policy of reunion.

Most people didn't even notice. I never nursed and pushed a cart, but I probably would've been able to. 

As for going to a separate room - even ignoring the implausibility that every place should have one - why should moms have to miss out on their meal and company? My kid didn't like being in a quiet room to nurse, he liked being around people unless he was ready for bed. I don't like being in a quiet room to nurse him, it made me fall asleep. 

As for the mess, my kid rarely left a drop behind. I usually nursed him, popped him off my boob and pulled my shirt up at the same time. Not sure why you think that's a problem.

As for comfort, why should YOUR comfort be more important than the baby and moms?  It's entirely possible to avert your gaze of your uncomfortable.

The real question is ""How likely is it that getting a restraining order will increase the level of violence, and how likely is it that it will precipitate a lethal situation, when one was not likely previously?""

Speaking from Portugal, a much poorer and smaller country with a population that is old:

Our health service, with its flaws, is tons better than the american.

You guys pay a huge price in insurance. With the values you pay per month for normal service, we can get very good private insurance.

The difference is, if you fall on hard times, health issues will not bankrupt you.

It doesn't treat the poor as mere organ donors, it doesn't destroy lives and futures. Its not as good? Ask your poor people how good your system is.

As for the innovation and availability and speed - who cares? That is irrelevant if I can't use it due to price; or if after I get that wonderful fast and amazingly efficient service my life and future is destroyed and I am a slave until I die.

Besides, I have my own business, and one of the reasons I could afford to risk it - with all the irregular payments and difficulties of a new business - is because I knew that if anything happened, health-wise, I'd be covered.

I wouldn't have risked, probably, if that meant that I'd have to choose between health insurance for me and mine and food on the table.

Frankly it is hard to even take the debate seriously. Its like domestic violence victims discussing ways to get your abusers to say please, or smile when they beat and rape the crap out of you. Big improvement, people, but you're still abused.

Btw without insurance or any cards, straight off the street, a root canal over here is about 75€ x 2. Getting an implant is expensive, 750 to 1000. Getting checked out by the eye doctor is 60 to 100, depends. Going to a private clinician about same.

Full operation with a day at the hospital to get some steel in a limb, including anesthetics and stuff, without any insurance and on a private hospital, was 3000 and a bit, including some visits there. Includes ER, all materials and such. Yes, its expensive. But it won't kill you.

1170	"The _reason_ it has Siri is because Apple - seemingly somewhat at odds with what kind of company Apple is - are envisioning a future where you interact less with technology.  That's why they ditched the headphone port, why the HomePod doesn't have (much of) a physical interface, and why the Watch won't cook dinner for you.  While Siri can do certain things in a HomeKit context, its primary purpose in the HomePod is, as Phil Schiller said at WWDC, to be a ""musicologist"" - in other words: A voice interface for playing music, rather than having to pull your phone out to select tracks/playlists or albums.

The additional functionality that follows with Siri is (in my view, at least) mostly a side effect of not shipping radically different versions of Siri on different devices.

Not having Siri on the HomePod would mean that it would need to have a physical interface more designed for the task, with a display, and you would be forced to either connect it to a third-party device or physically interact  with the speaker."

Say that same object crosses at a large fraction of c on a tangent. It may very well make it around a few times. It still gets to the center eventually, but even a photon at c if it's on a path that crossed the event horizon that path gets to the center. That path just might be 'orbiting' the core 100,000,000 times.

Negotiations failed and probably ended with ""see you in court"". Del Rey then tweets they are suing which makes Radiohead look like hypocrites as they were sued for creep. 

Fans are saying it's out of character and they are right, likely because she was actually dealing with a relentless legal team representing the publisher.
So the publisher uses the opportunity to save face by pointing out they haven't filed yet, possibly to compromise her integrity. 
The reason they haven't filed yet is probably they are not 100% confident in the win or are still building their case.

My mom was a high school principal and teacher for 10 years. I can tell you she spent most of the school holidays doing full days at the office, the only difference was she got home a little earlier. During school days she rarely got home before 8pm and was very often still preparing teacher schedules and stuff like that at home. 

Granted part of that was because apparently her deputy principals were useless and she often had to take on a lot of their work. 

My girlfriend is a primary school teacher, she spends most of the holidays finishing marking, because it's not just ticking boxes - students need individual feedback and analysis on how they're doing in various areas. Now multiply that by like 200 students. Also on lesson planning for the next semester because god knows how they're expected to prepare lessons during the school period with everything else going on (remember they have to mark holiday homework when school starts again so they'll have no time). Also finishing paperwork for their department, attending conferences, dealing with parents etc. 

I'm not saying they don't have holidays, and by all means there are careers that have worse hours. And they can often do their work at home during this time, meaning that they do have some capacity to look after children. But the idea that being a teacher is less than a full time job because of school holidays is, in my opinion, absurd.

Can you give all you have without love?  Yes!  There are many in my church that give greatly just to receive praise.  They want to give and then direct how the money is used.  If one has an issue with how the organization spends money, don’t give to them.  If the Church is doing God’s work, let them do what God is directing them to do.  
My church had a youth director that sold all he had.  He and his family (wife and four children) are now missionaries in south east Asia.  It is also possible to sell all you have in love.  This is not a theoretical conversation, it does happen.  
It is easy to see if the person is genuine in their love for others or if they are trying to show how humble they are.

"Maybe it's easier to see the difference if you think about subtractive mixing as absorption, not reflection. I.e. if you additively mix red and green, you get light that is a mix of red and green wavelengths. But if you mix red and green paint, you have one paint that absorbs (mostly) everything that isn't red and everything that isn't green respectively. You cannot use any 3 colours for this because of the way the human eye works. For example, magenta triggers both blue and red receptors in the human eye, cyan triggers blue and green. If you mix cyan and magenta paint, both paints reflect blue light, but the mixture will absorb both red and green, giving you blue. If you mix green and red instead, both paints absorb blue, and mixture absorbs green and red as well. If your receptors were very precise, that would give you black, but because human colour vision is significantly skewed, you get brown. Similarly, additive mixing doesn't work with arbitrary colours: if you mix red and green, you get yellow (because that is what you perceive when red and green receptors are triggered). But if you mix cyan (B+G) and magenta (B+R) you already get a mostly white perception, because all three receptor types are being triggered.

The key here is not the bias of the human vision toward green, it's that your colour perception is the result of three (mostly) discrete colour receptors."	unitedkingdom	askscience	-1

Child labor isn't a moral issue, it's a survival issue. There are incredibly poor parts of the world where the children have to work or the family doesn't eat. Is that immoral? I've yet to encounter a compelling argument. As noble as a law against child labor appears, if that family needs the child's production to eat that day, what does that law achieve other than make it more difficult for that family to survive? What eliminates child labor isn't government laws but worker productivity. As parents become more productive their compensation increases which allows them to spend some of that additional income on not sending their children to work.

&gt; commercial sex-trafficking (which there definitely is a market for)

This I think requires some additional clarification on your part for what you exactly mean by sex-trafficking. Prostitution is humanity's oldest profession.

So it's illegal for Frank to pay Susan for sex but if Jason pays Frank and Susan and they agree to have it filmed, the whole thing is legal.

As it stands right now though, they're still collecting phenomenal amounts of LR + AWD model orders, and with them being a relatively high-margin product, then why not?

1408	"**First Timer**

""*Alright lads, we have a 12 episode storyline and 13 episodes to fill. Let's put together a stylish clip-show with some new footage spliced in and reframe it to be about Lain's suicide thoughts and how Alice dominates her positive side. That'll fill half an episode.*"" 

 - That shooter's ranting makes a lot more sense now. Lain is in the wired, she is everywhere and part of her is gleefully evil.

 - I actually really like that first half. Sure, it's just a way of making sure viewers remember important details as we move towards the ending. But it highlights all the things it needs to highlight. The music is really good too. Also, cuts to a live-action shot.

 - Lain has gone from barely touching her computer to building a better high-end model to directly putting the system into her own brain. It explains the information overload we open with and what she is doing in the opening.


 - Either Face-Paint is toying with her again, or Lain's subconscious mind is pulling in people from the Wired to discuss the possibility of dying. As she only knows two suicide victims (I believe that's the correct term), she plus from the shooter and Chisa. Who actually give two different accounts on what death is like. Which makes sense, Lain has never died and she needs some guidance on whether or not she should act a certain way. 

 - Chisa's sadness makes me think that the man-made Heaven in the Wired isn't much better than life now. Or she can see what she is missing in the real world and regrets her choice. The other possibility is that she found out the 'god' in the Wired was just the coded thoughts of a dead Japanese computer expert and is going through her own crisis of faith while Lain is collapsing herself.


 - I think she is meant to be trapped in her own brain before that scene ends.


 - The Alice scene is interesting because it continues the theme of truth. Alice did fantasies about her teacher. That is the truth she and her friend want to bury (even through Alice doesn't seem to want to lie). Lain both did and did not spy on Alice, but Alice saw it so she struggles to believe it. Oh, and Lain is an alien in that scene. Sure, I believe it. The other option was showing up in a nightdress and holding a gun, the alien is slightly less worrying. Although it's now possible that Alice herself leaked that information out of some repressed desire to kill her passions. Or something.

 
 - I like that the buck of this episode is from Alice's point of view. It highlights how terrifying Lain's powers have become now that she is embracing her 'more-than-human' role. If somebody was capable of mass manipulation and possibly altering history: you would likely be worried about it. Especially if they were acting in your interest, but you couldn't control or even understand them. 

Lain went from a girl Alice thought she could understand with some effort to something she can't even imagine. Poor girls. But Lain is more confident because of Alice's kindness and is trying to be better in her own way. Whatever that is."	Many people who congregate there are angry at religion in general. I was too.

1409	"I too was hoping for a longer winter...but its possible they  could have a good ending. My understanding is each episodes is 1.5 to 2 hrs long, and the remaining major plot threads are Dany and Jon, Sansa and Bran, Arya, and Cersei.

I am hoping for (this is a rough sketch, all events are just stand ins. I have no real expectations for what actually happens).

Ep.1-2: White Walkers invade, the wall falls. Arya and Sansa escape from Winterfell. Jon sees the fall. Cersei remains arrogant, ignores Jon and Dany's warnings. 
Ep 3-4: Kings landing invaded. Cersei dies by Jaimes hand (or is saved by Tyrion). Sam reunites with Jon and Dany. Arya and Sansa plot lines reach near completion. Dark times. Cleganebowl.
Ep 5-6: White walkers battle. Jon and Dany victorious (or one dies). Arya is the new Lady of Winterfell. Sansa is a queen, somewhere. Jon is a legend. Dany lets the kingdom go. Tyrion is Kings Hand. Sam gets a happy ending.


I think its very doable as long as they focus on the broad strokes and the pacing and don't spend lots of time with, say, Grey worm learning to play music before a battle or something equally unimportant. The show can be finished in 9 hours. I do wish they had GRRMs novels as guides though. The first 2 seasons had great pacing. 

At this point the series is so long and drawn out, it would be nearly impossible to make a satisfying ending unless they start thinking outside the box. For example, Cleganebowl: its not going to get its own episode. Its going to be a 15 min battle that won't meet anyones expectations. But it could be received well if the Hound pulls an Indiana Jones and instead of battling the Mountain, just locks him in the castle with White Walkers and tells him to piss off.

Alternative hypotheses

Further information: Alternatives to general relativity
Because dark matter remains to be conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. Many hypotheses suggest that the theory of general relativity may simply be incorrect in describing these phenomena. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The most well-known theories of this class are MOND and its relativistic generalization TeVeS,[132] f(R) gravity[133] and entropic gravity.[134] Alternative theories abound.[135][136]

A problem with alternative hypotheses is that the observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the ""observational evidence"" section above). Any alternative hypothesis not only has to explain all the evidence, it also has to explain individual cases such as the Bullet Cluster,[137] wherein observations indicate that the location of the center of mass is far away from the center of baryonic mass.[138] Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.[139][140][141]

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is that while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.[142]"	IAmA	askscience	-1

I find this explanation somewhat implausible though. It would make sense to put addictive drugs in human food, because humans choose their food for themselves.

"	"This is false on many levels. TUA fits his offense better than Lawerence fits Clemson’s. Clemsons offense a lot like Auburn’s operates best when they have a true dual threat quarterback. By true dual threat I mean a guy that not only is a focal point in the run game, but an above average to elite passer to go with it. Bryant was a good runner, but couldn’t pass. Lawerence will be able to operate the game from a passing standpoint, but in the end will become a one dimensional offense because of the lack of quarterback run threat. I do think Lawerence is the better option over Bryant, but I don’t think they will be able to beat Alabama without the threat of the quarterback run. In both games against Alabama Watson carried the ball 20+ times and even though the rushing stats were not mind blowing it kept Alabama from pinning its ears back on early downs. Trevor Lawerence will be able to make all the throws Watson could, but I’m interested to see how he will do if he is consistently put in third and long situations with an O-Line that Alabama has abused for 3 years outside of the 4 th quarter game in 2016.

Complex silicon, phosphorus, and boron compounds tend to explode at liquid water temperatures. If we see silicon-based life, for example, we'd expect to see it in a very low temperature environment with a solvent like liquid nitrogen; it would also be biologically important in a very high temperature environment where silica (quartz) is liquid.

Exotic life is certainly possible - even probable, given recent study into the chemical dynamics of Titan. But in ancient Martian conditions, which would have been similar to our own, we have no theory which would predict life that wasn't based on complex carbon chemistry with water as a solvent. 

But that doesn't rule out interesting findings - any discovery of life on Mars would be interesting in its own way:

* Discovery of life that shares many common characteristics with Earth life, like use of RNA, DNA, and molecules of the same chirality, would suggest a common origin - and since Mars became friendly to complex carbon chemistry before Earth did and it's easier for debris to go from Mars to Earth than the other way around, that origin is more likely to be Mars than Earth.

* Discovery of life that has very different biochemistry would strongly suggest different origins, and strongly support theories of a life-filled universe - the anthropic principle requires us to set aside Earth as evidence (we are living observers, so it is unremarkable that our planet supports life), but if our closest neighbor has life without a common ancestor, it makes it much more likely that other places have life, too - the likelihood that the only two places in the galaxy that life independently evolved are Earth and Mars is infinitesimal.

* Discovery of life that largely shares our biochemistry but uses molecules of the opposite chirality would open a debate, because it kind of supports both points of view. (It might also intensify research into [manganese-rich desert varnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_varnish), which is interesting because the most plausible explanation for the manganese enrichment is biological, but we've looked fairly carefully and haven't found any microbes in it.

1460	"I mean, you're sort of missing out on the organized (especially post-Nixonian) drive to set up conservative think tanks and research groups, their sustained campaign for 'balanced reporting' (instead of unbiased), and their decades-long dismissal of any information source (media, academic, political) that questioned their own basic assumptions about the shape of the world. You're also forgetting about the (very much linked, and always pushed for by the right) removal of broadcasting standards and media ownership regulations that allowed people like Murdoch to inculcate a large chunk of the populace into a mindset that would be more accepting of the sort of conspiratorial rubbish that makes up 99% of Jones' programming.

Instead you seem to basically lay the blame at the doorstep of the MSM, which is flawed (moreso because of conservative policy) but better than nothing, and which already includes a diversity of viewpoints... and at the feet of the people who, still remaining in the somewhat rational world, dismiss these people after getting heartily tired of trying to discuss things with them - which, in itself, doesn't really happen very often... because the majority of people who seriously follow Alex Jones have been trained by their media (even before they find Jones) to ignore any facts (no matter how well researched) that goes against their own gut instincts - and, in many cases, not to even seek out alternative views, thus keeping them firmly within a single cult-like community. Take gun control: I have met a relatively small group of liberals who aren't willing to compromise in order to achieve their goals whilst still ensuring that those who love the second amendment still have access to an armoury (albeit a less powerful one) of weapons; ironically, this is a position that quite a few conservatives hold as well, since most polls show about 75% of Americans are in favor. The other 25%, which if you could Venn diagram it would probably include a lot of people in the conservative-jones media sphere, are just unwilling to compromise at all - and I would contend that this has more to do with those purposeful political and media pressure groups, and their decades of careful work, as opposed to the dismissive attitude of those who argue with them."

It's a barrier of entry thing. I am NOT comparing severity. 

Anyone can be addicted to eating. It's much more likely to find someone addicted to junk food than it is to find someone addicted to cooking themselves elaborate, five course meals every night. The latter requires effort, the other does not. Literally the point of weed is that it floods your brain with dopamine without you expending any effort. 

I don't think it's fair to add exercise to a list of things like gambling, junk food, etc. NOT because it's healthy and those things aren't. I think it's unfair because all of those things are available in abundance for the average person, and they don't really require a person to be in a specific place expending effort.

Okay sure, employees at fast money are guilty. Please provide me the evidence. I look forward to it LOL

Against your claim about them pumping it and saying deal with it, please provide evidence of insiders colluding with each other in order to push the price up. Positive coverage of course may result in increase in price, but as you say, correlation doesn't equal causation. So the burden of proof relies on you to show that the intentions of the talks they had were intended to solely pump up the price. Again I look forward to your evidence on that. And just in case you were wondering, circumstantial evidence does not incriminate lol

Why on Earth would you say they're trying to pump bch so hard? How many times have they covered it? Really what's your criteria of so hard.  I follow them and watch all crypto related clips that they post online, and for my view it's a handful of times. You can say that they give them a lot of air time but that doesn't make it true. 

I don't think you understand what the word evidence means. All you did is point out that they brought up bch multiple times and said it was a good investment. That's not evidence. I want evidence of collusion within fast money people with the hopes of pumping price. No other network is talking about crypto as much as they do.  I give them huge props because unlike say Bloomberg or Forbes, virtually all of their coverage on crypto is very positive.  they just happen to to also extent that positive Viewpoint to bch.

You have no idea what you're talking about. Of course you're going to go to add homonyms and say I'm chilling for bch. Check out my Twitter and my other post on Reddit. I'm on either side of the BTC vs. Bch debate.  the moment that anybody on the bch team does anything remotely close to this, I'll tear them to pieces.

As for the mess, my kid rarely left a drop behind. I usually nursed him, popped him off my boob and pulled my shirt up at the same time. Not sure why you think that's a problem.

As for comfort, why should YOUR comfort be more important than the baby and moms?  It's entirely possible to avert your gaze of your uncomfortable. If the very idea of it makes you uncomfortable, I'm not sure why seeing women and babies go into a separate small and cramped room would be any more comfortable for you."

In a way I’m like OP. According to my performance in the dating market, I would be pretty ugly. I’m talking about being in the lowest 10% in terms of looks. I’ve made about 300 approaches in my life, most of whom I assumed was my own attractiveness or lower (average looking). Not a single one yielded any positive results despite me approaching confidently. 

However, I’ve had 3 women approach me and start a relationship with me. They varied in objective attractiveness, as two were technically overweight. One of them absolutely could have landed a hotter dude than me though. I’ve been approached several times by, shall we say, obese women with fewer dating options. 

The thing is I look in the mirror and I don’t really see an ugly dude. I have some moderate acne on my neck area and I have a couple scars unrelated to acne. Besides that, I have no obvious deformities. I’m pretty fit at a decent BMI. I have some OCD and depression but my self confidence is high. I have some personality flaws but nothing outrageous, and my personality is considered “ok”. All I really ask for in a partner is to be kind and not be obese, and I still think that’s pretty lenient.

"If you haven't read *The Book of Joy: Lasting Happiness in a Changing World* by The Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu then I really suggest doing so. One of the core principals they talk about is pursuing your own personal happiness will never lead to true happiness, and that happiness really comes in providing happiness to others. In other words, the harder your look, the harder it is to find it, but the more happiness you put out there the more you get in return.

As an example pursing your own happiness is buying a new bag or clothes for yourself, but that only leads to a temporary reward and you continue to want more so you continue to buy new bags or clothes for yourself. Pursuing happiness for others might be buying a gift for a friend, or having someone over for a meal. In that pursuit you are not only bringing joy to yourself by making someone else happy, but you're interacting with others socially, which lead to them doing good things for you in return."	cringe	science	-1

Look for an American male with a possible connection to the military. His I.Q. will be above 105. He will like to masturbate, and will be aloof and selfish in bed. He will drive a decent car. He will be a “now” person. He won’t be comfortable with women. But he may have women friends. He will be a lone wolf. But he will be able to function in social settings. He won’t be unmemorable. But he will be unknowable. He will be either never married, divorced, or married, and if he was or is married his wife will be younger or older. He may or may not live in a rental, and might be lower class, upper lower class, lower middle class or middle class. And he will be crazy like a fox, as opposed to being mental.

But it sounds like you're internalizing a lot of guilt over things that aren't necessarily your fault. I don't understand why you think not being able to break the cycle of poverty is your fault - you're doing everything right as far as I can see: reducing expenses by having a roommate, holding down a professional job, etc. You're not a parasite - you're a human being trying really hard and working on figuring it all out. 

Homelessness is terrifying. I think you should attempt to avoid it at all costs. The main thing it sounds like you can do is talk to your roommate openly despite your fear. Hopefully she will be reasonable and sympathetic when you tell her you're so afraid of messing up that you're worried she'll kick you out. 

I would ask her how she think you guys can resolve your issues. Maybe defining some time for her to be alone in the apartment would help, or having her be really specific about what sets off her OCD so you can try to avoid it. Take notes! No one's memory is infallible, and she'll see that you're really trying. This is your best friend! You two can hopefully make it work. 

In regards to showering, my first reaction is, ""fuck them, shower in the bathrooms of the gender you identify with,"" but I understand that that might not be feasible depending on whether or not your gym is populated with ignorant assholes. One thing you can try is asking the manager at the gym where they think you should shower, or asking if there's a single shower anywhere. 

If you're extremely worried about expenses - maybe saving more will help you afford a new apartment if necessary? - look into relief options in your area. There's probably a soup kitchen nearby where you can get free food. See if you can qualify for food stamps or anything like that. There's probably also a shelter in your area, but I understand if you don't want to stay in one.

Then the day before ( I've seen two days as well) you switch to sips of a quarter of a gallon  from noon the day before and sipping just to get food down the day of the shoot or show. Sometimes it's just 24 hours sometimes 48. But dropping carbs the week before and bringing them back a few days before helps ""soak"" up the water by storing the carbs in the liver and muscle. You stop right before you spill over and get subq glucose storage which will pull the water subq which you don't want. There's water in his system and you eat sugary carbs and lift some weights to pump up. For ""enchanced"" lifters diuretics are involved because some stero can help you keep a pump with less work.

As long as you only want to watch a 1D line in space, you could use a ""streak camera."" Basically you get a mirror rotating crazy fast and then you uncover a slit when you want to capture your movie (if you can call it that). Light enters the slit and the spinning mirror ""wipes"" the light from the slit across a continuous roll of film. If you hold up your processed film, left to right will represent distance in space and up/down will represent time. 
Since time is continuous on the roll of film, you can capture insanely fast phenomena with these cameras -- on the nanosecond or picosecond time scale.

"&gt; What are you seeing that I'm missing?

That religious history has a pattern of killing off gods, often the ""top god"".  The idea that in all such cases, there must end with the ""one god"" to not ""get behind"" is problematic if that ""one god"" was killed off.

&gt;  cleared this up in the other part of what I wrote. Maybe you missed it. Christians are not arguing that God is a ""special case"" but rather that God performed the creative act of will

I'm not debating with ""Christians"", but with you the person.  I am often on either side of debates, based on what is being discussed, not the religion.  Nothing about whether he was a physical process or a will cover the idea that he could've been created.  Whether or not he is himself ""an atheist"" was the whole topic here.

&gt; which is fine, but not relevant to Christianity....

But we're not discussing Christianity.  We're discussing whether god is an atheist.  You specifically were commenting on how there must always be one with nothing behind.  I suggested that in the context we were discussing, many religions had the one with ""nothing behind"" die.  That seems to mess things up.

&gt; The OP argument here is, ""Assume God is real, does He not have a Creator?"" If I take it to mean, ""Assume Christianity is true, does God have a Creator?"" The answer is a clear no.

That's not what OP said at all.  He didn't even use the word ""Christianity"".  And he wasn't asking if God had a creator, but if god believed in a god above him (and if not if that made him an atheist).  You're the one who muddied it up even more by bringing up the mythology where the gods killed the beings that would be considered the creator god.

"I've read enough analysis and argued through enough points that I've gone from despising the movie to respecting it and understanding *almost* every move that was made that I initially thought was bad.

That doesn't change the fact that I and half the fans were upset upon walking out of the theater the first time. If that's the reaction to your movie then you've missed a step somewhere. Even if there is a good argument behind every controversial choice you make, it shouldn't take a conscious effort in order to enjoy Star Wars.

My final opinion is that EP.9 will make or break TLJ. If 9 is lightning in a bottle and in part thanks to the plot freedom and character development provided by the writing of TLJ, then TLJ can be timeless as most controversies will prove good for the sake of the next movie and like I said many of the others can simply be explained. If ep9 is poor or mediocre and has to retread old ground because TLJ wiped the board clean, then it will go down as a mess that scewed with the lore, the trilogy arc, and trolled the fans.

It's funny, (but not really at all), when Robin William's died, I talked to a couple of my friends about how I felt that could be my Dad sometime soon. 

Also, Robin William's death made me abnormally upset, to the point that I would hide at work and quietly cry about it. I'm just remembering this now as I think I kind of live in a way as to not dwell on the situation too much.

So, yes, perhaps the suicide of Robin Williams made the act more acceptable, and, perhaps the media explosion with his death helped others make the same decision.

Trying to fight without armor against a spear wielding foe is courting a swift death. Sure, Ser Gregore would have been much quicker without his plate armor, but he still wouldn't have been quick enough to avoid a spear thrust. Furthermore, using spears in a duel was traditionally not allowed unless both combatants were using spears, and that's because a spear is a *huge* advantage over a sword. Gregore likely could have objected to Oberyn using a spear, forcing the use of a sword, but as mentioned in other comments he isn't exactly a bright fellow, and he likely assumed it wouldn't matter anyway against an opponent a 3rd his size and wearing scarce armor.	science	asoiaf	-1

By the time he is in his mid thirties, if he weighs 120 kg (262 lbs) because he has ""bulked up"" he is heavy but some professional athletes are close to that and can still function well. 

So the assumption is, the extra gravity is similar to hanging extra weight on the overall frame so probably the body can take the extra weight although it will take time to adapt.  

Having less gravity creates all sorts of issues although no studies have been able to test anything close to .5 G. 

Several bodily functions relay on gravity and likely the lower gravity would affect them in unexpected ways. Bone density is an easy one and can be compensated for via exercise regimen. Others may be more difficult.

One concern is likely children developing in low or high gravity. A lot of child development may be affected adversely. "	"So do I.

My parents finally ended up as 7th Day Adventists, which I am completely fine with, as it has toned down my father quite a bit, and still provides the community that both of my parents desire about being in a church, and most importantly, they do not bother me about my personal decision not to participate in religion.

The fact is he 1) doesn't know how the story is going to end because there's literally like 30 subplots and instead of trying to start tying them up he expanded on them with his last books making everything slow to a crawl. 2) he doesn't want to end the series. This is what made him famous. As long as he has hordes of fans waiting for the next book, he's wanted. Look at JK rowling, she finished harry potter and she still hasn't gotten her groove back.

&gt; Hydrophobia (""fear of water"") is the historic name for rabies.[19] It refers to a set of symptoms in the later stages of an infection in which the person has difficulty swallowing, shows panic when presented with liquids to drink, and cannot quench his or her thirst. Any mammal infected with the virus may demonstrate hydrophobia.[20]

&gt; Saliva production is greatly increased, and attempts to drink, or even the intention or suggestion of drinking, may cause excruciatingly painful spasms of the muscles in the throat and larynx. This can be attributed to the fact that the virus multiplies and assimilates in the salivary glands of the infected animal for the purpose of further transmission through biting. The ability to transmit the virus would decrease significantly if the infected individual could swallow saliva and water.[21]"	"It is that easy.

By their own actions, the right has put their leadership of the House in jeopardy and possibly even the Senate. And the voters who cast their vote for him, either out of spite (which is one of the most ridiculous reasons to vote) or to ""shake things up in DC"", are now reaping what they have sown. And it's really just beginning; soon, the economic effects of Trump's trade war start tricking down to American consumers, many of whom are poor Trump voters.

Also, I would hardly classify Daniels as ""the left,"" or even the voice of the left. Sure, the allegation is fun to laugh at but considering the bald-faced lying Trump has been doing since he began his term, including denying he ever did anything with her, it's really no surprise that the allegation has come to light. But ""the left"" isn't really running with this one, especially with the potential confirmation of (yet another) conservative sexual predator to the Supreme Court requiring more serious attention.

"&gt; Even if I’m the one offended she will find a reason to get pissed off about it and I end up being the one offering the olive branch, compromising, or swallowing my pride and taking one for the team.

You're a supplicant doormat afraid of confrontation. She see's this for the weakness that it is and has no respect for you. If you act like a doormat, why wouldn't she walk all over you?

&gt; I thought she would notice and appreciate my efforts and maybe realise that she’s being unfair and in some instances a total bitch, but it’s only made matters worse because instead it’s given her some twisted sense of justification: if he’s making peace it must have been his fault. 

Because you are still scared of your girlfriend you have abandoned all hope of solving the issue yourself. Instead you hope she fixes the problem while you continue to end over backwards for her. 

You have also made a covert contract along the lines of ""If i remain a nice guy to her...she has to respect me"" which is a completely wrong way of addressing the issue. 

&gt; Sometimes I feel like any self respecting guy would just leave,

Yes. That is exactly what a self respecting human being would do.

&gt; but at the same time I really love her and I feel if I stay calm, compromise and be the bigger person, she might realise and come around.

You don't really love her. You are insecure man in a toxic relationship to scared of his girlfriend to initiate a break up and probably scared of being alone. 

You have also doubled down on the nice guy covert contract. No matter how much you suck up to her you will not guarantee the success of this relationship rather, especially by the looks of it now, the impending failure. 

&gt; It’s almost like she wants someone who she can shit all over

Everyone may need a rock to keep them steady once in a while but nobody wants a complete tool they can shit on. She treats you this way because this is the precedent you have set for yourself with your behavior. Take note though I'm not trying to blame you for this, mostly because i don't think moralizing this issue does any meaningful help. **If you put someone on a pedestal, they have no choice but to look down on you.** I personally don't see ant point in continue to try to salvage this relationship, it is clear she is disgusted by you. I suggest moving on, going no contact, and working on yourself. Perhaps read ""No More Mr.Nice Guy""

We fed the homeless in Florida through donations from local restaurants and we were constantly being harassed by the police. City council eventually passed a law stating that you were unable to publicly feed more than 15 people at local parks.

Once this law was passed the police department would have plain clothes police officers in different parks throughout the city on days that they knew we would be handing out food. The officer would watch from a distance and once they saw that we had fed more than 15 people he would swoop in and shut us down, while writing us a ticket and on some occasions arresting our volunteers.

Think about that, this country would rather spends thousands of taxpayer dollars to set up police sting operations, and change our towns laws to attack us, instead of helping us feed the homeless or at the very least just leave us alone and let us do our thing.

It’s pretty funny too, because the police officers and city council members almost all had ‘support our troops’ bumper stickers, and city council members would constantly talk about helping our veterans when they were running for election. I would say a conservative estimate would be that 70% of the people we fed were homeless veterans.
