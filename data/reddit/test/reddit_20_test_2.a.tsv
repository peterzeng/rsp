And harms the poor a lot more than it harms the rich: it might be one less meal for an impoverished person, whereas 1% might just be a lower contribution to the wealthy person's 401k. Continuing with the speeding ticket analogy, there needs to be a threshold in that system that has a maximum amount you're allowed to be fined if your income is below a certain amount.

&gt; Unfortunately in America, there are a lot of lower and middle-class people who would actually oppose this measure, because they love licking the boots of the rich.

Here's the original quote (presumably translated from Russian, so not an 'exact' quote):

&gt; Something has to be done to boost business. Tesla is not doing very well. Everybody knows that. It was an excellent trick. Just wonderful

Is it just me or does that seem pretty sarcastic and not an actual complement? If it's not intended to be sarcastic, it's certainly faint praise, only complementing the advertising aspect without mentioning anything about the engineering accomplishment of successfully landing two rockets (that had already previously flown to space) and attempting to land a third all at the same time.

He's also wrong in regards to Tesla. Their problems have nothing to do with lack of demand or lack of investors but inability to make their Model 3s fast enough. Having a million more orders right now wouldn't help them at all.

They don't need more investors now either. They haven't diluted their stock in a while. The only thing that will help them is reaching their production goals for the Model 3 (especially reaching 5,000 cars produced per week by the end of Q2) and they already have enough capital on hand to do that."

They are very adorable and sweet but you’re 100% correct about this current fad. People don’t realize it is a poodle/lab mix and holy cow that is an insane combo. They get all the energy and craziness of a lab with the clever poodle. They all seem to have pretty messed up digestive systems and super prone to food allergies. Customers were always coming in practically in tears because their dog can’t eat most food due to some odd sensitivity and the vets didn’t have a clue (most vets know little to nothing about pet nutrition). It’s a mess with this poor breed. 

Dog fads in general are problematic, along with buying from breeders over helping keep the shelters overcrowded (often with plenty of surrendered doodles or much better behaved dogs).

Poor people are crazy, rich people are eccentric. The same applies to the NBA."	"Nope... The Libs were the ones who introduced this mismatch technologies. Lab had pretty much everyone on Fibre to the Premises (FTTP). 

Libs decided Fibre to the Node (FTTN) would be good enough. This decision was made based on a bunch of assumptions that went against all expert advice and evidence:

1. The existing Copper Network had been maintained to an adequate level. Instead, the Copper Network is falling apart and a huge roadblock in the Government's ability to use 100-year-old infrastructure as the basis of their next century technology.

2. That our infrastructure needs over the next 100 years could be based on mediocre global contemporary needs (FTTN wasn't really that impressive at the time it was announced). FTTN would have made us a decently well-equipped nation 5-10 years ago, but just about every expert knew it wouldn't be enough to sustain emergent technologies and needs. FTTN just won't cut it for what we will want/need to do in 10-20 years. 

3. That rapidly increasing internet usage would *plateau* for no real reason whatsoever. Youth engagement with the internet is skyrocketing, modern business projections all point the rising need of quality internet access. The Libs in their infinite wisdom decided that future generations would find no more uses for the internet than we had and that we had pretty much reached peak internet. 

[Malcolm even had a fancy whiteboard presentation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/aug/26/malcolm-turnbull-nbn-internet-speed-whiteboard-video), where he arbitrarily cut off internet usage needs at about ~8mb range to make it seem like FTTN would be all we needed going forward.


Then in an attempt to cover their mistakes, the Libs have rolled out a wide range of Not Quite Right style NBN projects and that's where this current mismanaged lottery system comes from. 

Now depending on your luck and assuming you are in a urban/suburban enviroment, you might have:

1. FTTP (if you were lucky to get connected during Lab Government).

2. Fibre to the Curb (FTTC), where the Liberal government has decided to effectively concede their FTTP vs FTTN debate without actually conceding or giving us the 100% best solution available.

3. Hybrid Fibre Co-Axial (HFC), basically a FTTN spinoff that involves using the same cables pay TV does. Also Lib.

4. FTTN, if you were unfortunate enough to be one of the *lucky* people to have their NBN rollout during the early Lib years.



This mess is labelled  Multi-Technology Mix (MTM) and advertised as a good thing, but it's really just the Liberal party fucking up. 



Oh, and lets not forget how [Malcom Turnbull had investments in a French FTTP company](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/turnbull-likes-fibre-to-the-home--in-france-20120821-24kpe.html) while saying there wasn't a market value in FTTP technology... 

I'm all for hating both parties, but this NBN mess isn't a ""two sides to every story"" kind of situation, it falls entirely on Malcom Turnbull who has single handedly fucked one of our nation's largest ever infrastructure projects.

It's (extremely) unhealthy, you might face fertility issues, you'll limit what you can physically do and you'll limit your lifespan too (maybe for the better because otherwise you'd be putting strain on health insurance for longer). You'll likely limit your career potential, it'll negatively affect your social life, dating, physical intimacy, shopping for clothes becomes harder etc. There are no benefits to being obese or even bigger. 	sex	relationships	1

46	Speaking from experience as someone who’s been into chaos magic for a little bit now, you really should avoid labeling everything that might be considered self-hypnosis as being chaos magic. It makes you sound like a crazy person.	"In the Vedas a story is related of the primordial man Purusha, who was cut up into parts that became all of humanity. The head became Brahmins (priests, scholars, and teachers), the arms became the Kshatriyas (warriors, rulers, and administrators), the thighs became the Vaishyas (farmers and merchants), and the feet became the Shudras (laborers and servants). Dalits are those who didn’t fit into this scheme (with other groups becoming scheduled tribes for various complicated reasons). How literally anyone takes this story depends on their philosophical outlook within Hinduism, but most would probably see it as being metaphor for the transcendental nature of the self while also providing a very basic principle of how to set up and maintain an agricultural society rather than a literal description of cosmic events.

Historically, an extremely simplified version would be to say that the early Indo-Iranians responsible for developing Vedic philosophy likely had the same “priest-soldier-farmer” societal division you see in every other Indo-European culture and religion, and then kept adding rungs to the bottom over time. Those native to Bactria and Pakistan/Northern India when they migrated would’ve become Shudras, with Dalits as a later development.

None of this is any defense for continuing the practice today, but this is a cultural practice that in various forms has been practiced for thousands of years, and it’s regrettably understandable that there’s so much resistance to change in some corners, even in the modern age."	science	news	1

I'm not focusing on anything, im correcting your misunderstanding, learn to read better.


&gt;I am using basic math to prove why you're wrong.

Lol, no, watch this math, 2+2. = 4, therefore my argument is correct, make sense to you?

&gt;You have said things about how statistics work which is provably untrue

Such as?

&gt;Your claim was that probability scales in proportion to population size. This is provably untrue. If population size increases by a factor of N, then the standard deviation increases by a factor of the root of N. If country A is 64 times bigger than country B, then the standard deviation in proportion to population is 8 times smaller.

No, that was not my argument, you seem to think you are smarter than you are, my argument is the data sets for Norway and Finland are valid when looking at gun deaths/shootings, and you attempting to remove them is dishonest. That's why I asked you if you would leave them in if the numbers where smaller, because we both know you would and it highlights your bias.

&gt;For instance, if I flip 10,000 coins, then the standard deviation is 50, or 0.5% of the total. There's a 98% chance that the total number of heads will be between 49-51%. There is a near zero chance that I will have 55% heads or more.

&gt;If I flip 100 coins, the standard deviation is 5, or 5% of the total. In that case, the odds of getting 55% heads from 100 flips is 16%.

&gt;If I flip 10 coins, the standard deviation is 1.58, or 15.8% of the total.

&gt;The smaller the sample size, the more likely it is for an anecdote to defy the odds.

51	"Check out [this article.](https://www.savetheroyalnavy.org/the-reasons-hms-queen-elizabeth-has-two-islands/)

TL;DR Redundancy through spacing out the engines more; safer piping for the funnels; less wind turbulence; less radar interference by spacing out the main radars."	"The article explains it:

(TL;DR There is possibly a defect in the brain circuitry that prevents schizophrenics from recognizing the voice as their own.)

&gt;Whenever a person hears her own voice, an unconscious recognition circuit lights up in the brain. It works by comparing the sound she hears with the expected sound of her voice, a prediction honed through years of experience with conversation. If the actual voice matches the prediction, the brain concludes that the voice was self-generated. Alternatively, if the heard voice doesn’t match the prediction, the brain concludes that someone else is speaking.

&gt;Schizophrenic patients like Brandon are believed to have a defect in this circuit. When Brandon hears his own voice, the unconscious matching system incorrectly identifies a mismatch (false negative) and prevents him from consciously recognizing that it is his own speech that he’s experiencing. His brain is left to reconcile two seemly contradictory pieces of information: on the one hand he hears a voice that isn’t his own. On the other hand, there’s nobody else in the room. So, whose voice is it?

&gt;The brain tries to generate the most logical explanation it can. Who could project a voice into Brandon’s mind who isn’t in his vicinity? Perhaps someone with access to impressive technologies—someone with the means and motivation to spy on him. Someone from the FBI? That’s possible. If an agent had implanted a chip in his brain, that would explain the voice in his head. If the agent has been spying on Brandon for a while, that would explain why the voice seems to know so much about him.

&gt;The brain is a master storyteller, designed to make sense of the chaos of our lives. It compensates for the presence of auditory hallucinations, caused by a defect in self-recognition, by writing a narrative to account for them. It's no accident that schizophrenic patients reach for spy agencies, religious entities, or supernatural forces when describing the voices in their heads. These are theories that the brain concocts to explain how a foreign voice could infiltrate a mind, know it intimately, and torment its victim with relentless surveillance. Faced with such bewildering circumstances, the explanation the brain generates is surprisingly logical.

- Similar to Ep. 2.01, this episode did well in setting the tone for the season but also starting things off with a more calmer, lighthearted moment and reminding us of the little quirks that makes the protagonists who they are and why we still care for them ( Levi's cleanliness habit, Sasha's potato fetish, Eren arguing with a horse, etc.).

That's a bit counter-intuitive since those things can only will only ever happen when republicans aren't in control."	"Are those differences between axons in a discrete or continuous range? I'm guessing those changes affect the voltage potential as the presence of ions at either side of the synaptic gap will cause an increase of voltage potential with an increase in charge, and the gap length will determine a voltage potential at which the charge will jump from one axon to the next over the gap.

So not only is it then not binary, discretizing the synapse properties would lead to potentially a very high number base. For example, if there were even 10 charge states corresponding to 10 gap widths (since gap width and total charge before firing are not linearly independent), that's still a base 10 number instead of a base 2 number.  Even at base 2, 7000 synapses is still a humongous number. Any higher base would be unfathomable, like say base 10, because it's a 7000-digit number.  I don't think it's right to quantify it in divisions of any word size other other 7000 digits isn't really representative at all, because the total neuron state would be all 7000 synapses simultaneously it seems to me."

Finally, another of our friends pulled the poor guy aside and had a long discussion about the rapist vibes he was giving off, and how he was his own worst enemy when it came to finding a date. He WAS a bit offended, but it worked. 

Two months later, he was at a bar with us when he met the woman he later married.

134	"Make your own. Prepare sugar, potassium nitrate (saltpeter, can be found as stump remover), a container (an empty TP roll is great), some duct tape, a fuse (optional), food coloring drops (also optional), a single pan to cook. Use a portable stove and do it outside - in case you fuck up, you don't want to fill your home with smoke. The proportions for sugar and saltpeter are 2:3; 40g of sugar and 60g of saltpeter should be enough for a TP roll.

Wrap the tube in duck tape, making sure to wrap the bottom. 

Transfer the sugar and saltpeter into the pan and put the stove on low fire. Stir the mixture continuously and make sure it doesn't burn. After about 10 minutes it'll start to caramelize - at this point put in food coloring if you have any. When it finishes caramelizing (no lumps left, more smooth texture) turn off your stove and pour the mixture into the tube. Make sure it's not getting dark - it's likely to burn when it does. Insert the fuse into the mixture (it's optional as the mixture is flammable). Wait until the whole thing solidifies, you can use your fridge for that. Bore a few (4 should be enough) holes at the bottom of the tube (otherwise the pressure can make this explode!). Set the fuse/the top on fire and have fun."	It's not sarcasm.

143	"&gt;So your basis for good rules for a competition is that if people think and unwritten/unspoken thing makes sense to impose on the competition, after the fact, that it means everyone competing in the thing should have inherently known that the unspoken/unwritten rule that didn't exist actually existed and would get them DQed? 

It's more the fact the Chuunin exams are about testing the individual's ability, and the Kote goes against that. Everyone in the chuunin exams understands this to an extent so it's not that much of a leap to figure Boruto can reason it for himself. 

I'd imagine a disqualification for anyone that uses an external-ability from a third party to cause a similar DQ. Even the tailed beasts require the user to make their own jutsu, the Kote is basically asking for someone to do the jutsu for you and claiming it as your own achievement. 

&gt;All I am saying is that the options are poor writing/magic it happened outside of any scene or there is no basis for it being a disqualifying action. 

It's also pretty plausible they went through the rules beforehand, even the puppet guy doesn't get DQ'd because he was technically not inside the ring from the start and it's accepted by everyone.

Look at banks. Banks are incredibly regulated. My father was a CFO of a mid-sized bank. One of their claims to *success* was lower NFS fees. This attracted obviously lots of poorer customers who willingly overdrew their accounts and racked up charges. The government sees this and says that's exploitation. His bank did a study of the customers who overdrew to understand why they were doing this. They found out it wasn't from a lack of understanding how NFS charges work but that it was ***cheaper*** than the alternative like a late phone bill or power bill!

It's *good business* being a 3rd place that is inviting and welcoming to the community, regardless of intention to actually patronize the business, because 1 having a packed house builds up the appeal of the space as a place to go, 2, engendering good will with the community creates a loyalty with the people there, and 3, those people will buy something eventually and more often than not.

229	"Comparing the number of deaths, which all people eventually experience, to the number of murders, the worst crime we know, does indeed trivialize murder. It compares murder to a naturally unavoidable everyday occurrence.

Your second comparison is much more meaningful, and it should've been put that way, or rather the number of unjustified shootings by police. At least these cases are in the same category, violent death. It still ignores a lot of the moral implications, or pretends that killing is all the same, Police shooting a suspect to prevent a murder would be morally equivalent to a suspect shooting a victim. Unless you are a true pacifist that regards all violence as inherently and equally wrong. But then we'd be talking about pacifism, not numbers.

The number of ""mass shootings"" on the other hand is almost irrelevant, because it makes little moral difference if n persons were killed in rapid succession at the same crime scene or if they were murderer over the course of a year. "	"How do they verify that 1 in 4 or 1 in 6 statistic?

It would mean that more than 20% of all humans have experienced sexual abuse. Something a quarter of all women, a sixth of all men experienced would mean the number of perpetrators is insanely huge and the number of survivors even higher. 

One out of every five people randomly selected from the street would have suffered abuse. We would have to reevaluate ""childhood"" as a concept and the definition of ""abuse"" if said abuse would be more common than a broken bone on the playground or getting measles.

That should not mean something like that is okay, not that it can ever be okay.

But one of the aspects of that statistic is wrong, must be wrong, just out of logical reasoning. Something that happens to a fifth of all kids is so common that it can't be trauma or the definition of trauma in that case is wrong or it can't be abuse or the definition of abuse is wrong in that case or it actually is not that common as they claim.

231	"Even though I have no idea of business management outside of what I learned in college, basically the difference in both is that the CEO has control of the company while shareholders have a higher say on how the company is run due to how much they have invested in the company. Basically the CEO can do whatever they want to help the company and have a say on what goes, but the board gets the final decision. Since Elon is on the board he has a huge say because he also put a lot of money in it. But despite that if the majority shareholders decided he wasn't good for the company, they would have voted him out. 

Compare this to Microsoft where Bill Gates is a board member of the company yet he doesn't run it. A huge difference between a CEO and an investor is that no matter what the company does, a shareholder will always overpower a CEO, simply because they invested more money. If a majority shareholders have a say in what happens, then no matter what, they can remove a CEO, even though he's a chairman. "	"Halo does this which is why I love them in that aspect.

236	"Are you me? My first name is Chris, and my wife has this complaint about our sex life on occasion.

I don't feel insecure about it, though, and I am going to explain to you why you shouldn't either.

1. **They are her exes for a reason.** Spontaneity is all well and good, but it can be a liability in relationships. And that's just the one off the top of my head. I don't know you, or your wife, or her exes (unless by some *really* weird coincidence I happen to be friends with one or more of you), but I know that women don't look at men whom they are attracted to and could potentially settle down with and then just suddenly go ""Oh never mind I'm gonna go with someone else who is less suitable for me."" If she wanted to still be with those men, she would be. She is not. She is with you. She *chose* you. This means that you were the best choice, overall, even if that means a compromise or two had to be made. And if you're going to assume that she was somehow wrong in her analysis of your suitability, well, that's a huge can of worms that I am *not* gonna help you pack back up. ;)
2. **You can become more aggressive in the sack.** This is something my wife and I are working on. (Or, at least, we were, before we were derailed by the arrival of our first child. Hard to experiment with new sex if you're barely getting any sex.) If you're like me, it's not particularly in your nature... but if you're like me, you are still planning to give it a shot, because you love your wife more than anything, and if something would make her happy, it's worth trying for.
3. **Safety and reliability are GOOD QUALITIES**. My wife had one other major relationship before she met me. They had aggressive, animalistic sex... when he wasn't stoned out of his mind, or attempting to turn their apartment into a homeless shelter, or getting fired from jobs. *Stability matters*, because it's hard to build your life on quicksand. It's hard to go through the day when your relationship, the one thing that should be fueling you up and giving you energy, is draining you and tiring you out instead. And that's what my wife had with her ex. And that's why he's her ex. ""Fun"" and ""excitement"" are all well and good, but they don't make a home.
4. **The fact that you're not perfect is not news to her.** Trust me, she knew about your shortcomings before you guys got married. Again, she chose you. She chose you anyway. If this were really a big deal, she'd have said something before now.

Now, you have some insecurities regarding her comments. That's okay. Talk to her about it. Tell her what you overheard, and tell her that it made you feel inadequate. I am certain -- *certain* \-- that she will tell you a lot of the same things I just did. Then, take the opportunity to ask her what she'd like you to do differently, and how. Find out what she misses about the spontaneity and/or the fucking, and see if you can implement it. It may work; it may not; at the very least, it'll be fun to try.

237	"I spent a year with the Park Service as a Rare Plant Scientist - most visitors that I saw assumed I was a ""Ranger"" because I had the uniform and badge and was all over the woods, but I was rarely associated with any law-enforcement or interpretative activities.

A lot of people don't realize HOW MANY different Parks Service jobs there are, and how flexible the requirements for entry-level positions are.  I'd encourage you to search the government jobs website.

I was in the Smokies, fresh out of grad school as a biologist, specializing in botany.  The job was for a 9 month appointment with various options for extension - and also a few unexpected opportunities to move up to full-time, year-round stuff.

As a non-permanent full time, I did not get benefits, but the pay was decent for the time (this was almost 20 years ago).  Also, in my particular case, they provided me a room in a cabin to stay in.

For the most part, I spent 3 days (Monday thru Wednesday) in remote areas of the Park, mapping and counting populations of various rare plants, and in some cases, taking anti-poaching measures and coordinating with law-enforcement rangers regarding signs of poachers (yes, poaching protected plants was a big thing).

Thursdays were spent unpacking, sorting, and repairing equipment, downloading data, drying out tents, etc.  Heavy rainy weeks we (there were 4 on my crew) entered data, copied and filed field notes, ran analyses, etc.  

It could have been a viable career for me, except for one thing - cold weather was coming and my position would have been nearly entirely indoors for the duration, and I had just met my future wife who lived in Florida.  So I left it to do other stuff.  But hands down, it was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my life.

The Smokies has an associated non-profit (Friends of the Smokies, or similar) as I am certain that many other National Parks do.  You can find potential volunteer opportunities through them.  

Not all National and State Parks are actually associated with outdoors stuff, believe it or not.  Many State Parks are also rarely staffed beyond seasonal interpretative and maintenance.  Look around at possible openings all over, and don't be afraid to ask about them.

252	"That is a very real possibility given enough time. 1984 is what happens when people slowly become accustomed to these kinds of privacy violations. As we have already seen, people will embrace any and all privacy violations if it gives them a bit more convenience in their lives, and even moreso if it's free of charge.

A good example of this is the use of communication services. Once one of those privacy invading proprietary services becomes popular, everyone uses it and it is impossible to get out without something really bad happening to that service, in which case, everyone switches to yet another privacy invading proprietary service, thinking that they're safe.

One example is the chatting application that gamers tend to use.

Originally, everyone tended to use IRC, which is an open standard and very simple to implement into whatever application.

Then Skype came around and offerred many more features than IRC did, but it was not an open standard. Everyone flocked to it and started using it, but then Microsoft bought them out and slowly made it turn to shit. People still use Skype today for video chat, but not as often as they used to. It remains a household name.

Then gamers switched to TeamSpeak, which is yet another proprietary platform. Not too sure why people switched to TeamSpeak (probably just because they didn't like Skype), but they switched away not too long after.

Then gamers switched to Discord. Discord is yet another free of charge proprietary service without any notable form of monitization (yet). Discord goes back to an IRC style, but where only they could host servers (no federation of any sort). As of now, nothing too nefarious seems to have happened with Discord, but it's only a matter of time until they either get bought out or they have to start monitizing somehow, whether that's through selling ads that track their users, or if it's by charging for the service.

Gamers don't give a shit about freedom or privacy, and this has been repeatedly proven by what programs they use. Gamers also tend to influence the programs that less tech savvy people use, as PC gamers specifically tend to be more tech savvy in general.

If people cared about privacy or freedom, they would be using Matrix.org over Discord, or Mastadon over Twitter, or Wire/Signal/other over WhatsApp, etc. But the problem is that the few people who want to use these privacy-respecting libre applications would have to get everyone else that they talk to to use it, and everyone else is already using the established proprietary platforms, and they can't be bothered to download another app on their phone to talk to you, even though they don't mind downloading an app to get a slight discount on something or a new popular phone game that came out.

Maybe Matrix bridges could fix this in the future, as Matrix allows you to talk to people on most other platforms using bridges. The only problem with this is that bridges are not easy to use and you have to host a server for them. If the bridges became easy to use and didn't require hosting a server, then I think Matrix has a shot. It would be great if you could join a room like this: @InsertRoomNumberHere:HostedDiscordBridge.gg or @SomeDude:HostedWhatsAppBridge.org.

258	"Many religious texts refer to the [Abrahamic God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Abrahamic_religions) as the same deity behind Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, but distinct from the similar all-present benevolent [Sikh God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ik_Onkar). However, [others](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/is-allah-god/) [claim](http://www.ciu.edu/content/allah-islam-same-yahweh-christianity) [otherwise](https://billygraham.org/decision-magazine/december-2013/do-christians-and-muslims-worship-the-same-god/), that the God of Christianity cannot be the same being as Islam's Allah. 

My question is not whether the Abrahamic God is the same God across religions. My question is this:

Is the ""same God"" question a meaningful one? 

Consider the following debate between religious folks worshipping different gods:
""I worship the all-powerful omnipresent creator of mankind who demands I not eat pork!""
""Well, I worship the all-powerful omnipresent creator of mankind who demands I not work on Sundays!""

Now, consider the following religious conversation between religious folks worshipping the *same* god:
""I worship the all-powerful omnipresent creator of mankind, and he told me not to eat pork!""
""I too worship the all-powerful omnipresent creator of mankind, but you must have misheard him; he told me not to work on Sundays!""

To me, the scenarios leading to each of those conversations are indistinguishable. Deciding whether a different version of God is the ""same"" God as your God is at best a matter of faith, and at worst a matter of bigotry and caprice. Am I missing something? Is there a logical, rational way to determine whether two religions are talking about the same being? Or is it just spinning wheels?"	Did he call out anyone by name?

Depending on the location of the station, you can see trains/busses arrive and leave from a distance before you actually arrive.

Snakes 'walk their jaws' over the prey bit by bit until consumed, the teeth face backwards aiding a better grip. Snakes jaws are no separate but joined by flexible ligamants IIRC so more manipulate out of position to help consume something larger than the snakes head. Sort of rule amongst snake people is the jaws can distend say approx 3 times the width of the snakes overall head size, but maybe more if the snake gets a case of the munchies. lol  

If they swallow the prey item head first, they get it down pretty quick as all the limbs/extremities fold into the body and slip down the snakes throat without much effort.

An oversize meal doesn't mean the snakes stomach would burst, snakes don't have a fixed rib cage like us and the snakes body can distend to incredible sizes at times. An oversize meal means maybe the snake cannot move away due to the weight of the prey, and maybe die form exposure to direct extreme sun. Or possibly a predator comes along and kills the snake as it cannot defend itself properly or flee the area and seek refuge. 

Lots of snakes eat something to big and spit it out half way down when effort becomes too much. 

If find dead birds, rodents etc around that appear to have the upper head/neck area 'rotted away' to bone but rest of body is intact sometimes, not always but sometimes it can be little Tiger snake or alike that could't get the bird/mouse/rat etc down past the prey's 'shoulders'. lol "	The snakes get excited more than anything, they don't really have any real form of life when kept in a small box.

It's double edged because consumer debt is a **very bad thing** for economies. Economies based on consumer debt fail hard and fast within a generation. Guess what's happening as we speak? Yeah, this has historical precedent (although, this time is so much worse because it's a global, not local phenomenon). History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme.

It's also double edged because high liquidity and loans are the lifeblood of modern (Read: post 1800) economies. Done *sanely*, having access to loans means businesses are easier to get started. Since 99% of buisnesses fail, making it easy to start a business is in the macro sense a very good idea. Problem today is, *we don't do anything remotely approaching sanity.* Businesses nowadays take loans to repurchase stocks and pay off old loans. Nowhere in that previous sentence does anything actually increase their revenue, and that means they are entirely incapable of repaying this debt without cuts they'd never want to implement (dividend cut would defeat the purpose of the stock repurchases, who the heck will cut their own salary, and cutting workers rarely leads to direct revenue increases). It's a ticket to insolvency.

So, consumer loans are poison, corporate loans are a necessity, but sanity is required for both. How can this be solved without banks? Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Yes, you will need someone to orchestrate it (and you can call that a ""bank""), but doing what LendingClub or any of its comepetitors did on a larger scale would be a simple solution that would also democratize loans (that is, let even the poor get a fair chunk of the massive profits that at the moment are reserved for banks and banks alone)."	worldnews	Bitcoin	1

Essentially, CF is a single gene defect.  One Gene, one protein from that gene, gets screwed up because of various mutations.  The most common of these mutations deletes a single amino acid that makes the protein not fold correctly resulting in its destruction. 

These drugs contain one compound, a chaperone that help this misfolded protein get to the surface of the cell, then a other compounds that helps the protein stabilize and work better. 

There's been a ton of basic science to show these strategies work and a ton of clinical trials to prove they actually work in humans and are safe.

He also signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted credit-default swaps from regulation. 

In 1995 Clinton loosened housing rules by rewriting the Community Reinvestment Act, which put added pressure on banks to lend in low-income neighborhoods. It is the subject of heated political and scholarly debate whether any of these moves are to blame for our troubles, but they certainly played a role in creating a permissive lending environment.

"I can see you're struggling with this as a social gender issue rather than a pharmaceutical one. That's fair, women's BC has a pretty messed up history. The answer **you** want has very little to do with modern medical a drug regulations, and everything to do with regional/cultural norms. As a result, it comes with a whole bunch of assumptions - many of which are entirely reasonable but not necessarily relevant to the ostensible question.

So, the actual answer to your question is actually that this an entirely different drug in an entirely separate regulatory context. That it is treated strictly has very little to do with social trends. Further, to think thst nobody is working on women's birth control is to be mistaken; an area that potentially lucrative simply doesn't go ignored.

If you want me to address your social issues, that's a valid concern but not something I can answer. In my circles, nobody expects anything beyond carefulness and condom use - as we're well aware of nasty side effects. You say ""we""  -  I suspect that you're actually just expressing frustrations about your local sociocultural attitudes, not speaking for us all. I might be wrong about that, but I don't blame you if I'm right. It's frustrating.

All that said, I frankly don't feel all of that has an especially significant impact on drug development. The fact is, pharmaceuticals follow the money like everyone else. Having worked in the medical field, I would honestly say there's *more* of a trend to develop and market things for women right now, as this is seen as highly profitable.

So, this is probably not the answer you want, but the state of birth control is mostly to do with regulatory context over time and  the level of development in the drugs.

And they've been warning us for decades about what's to come. 

Humanity, like yourself, has preferred to ignore them and pretend it's all going to be okay because that's what we'd rather hear and it allows us to continue our wasteful, polluting ways in blissful ignorance while ignoring all the signs of climate collapse around us. 

The only thing the apocalyptic fortune tellers have been wrong about is that their worst care scenario projections were actually too optimistic and as we continue to observe and collect climate data we're seeing the data blow right through those worst case scenarios.

He's the world's leading authority on sea ice, he's been to the polar zones 50 times and he's the author of A Farewell to Ice, one of the most terrifying books I have read. He lays out exactly what has happened to the poles of our planet over the past 4 decades, what is happening to the sea ice today, and what is to come.

Spoiler alert: The arctic sea ice will melt. All of it. And not in 50 or 100 years, but in 5 at most. The multi year sea ice is already gone and we're left with a thin sheet of yearly ice that forms and retreats each summer. Soon we'll have ice free summers up north and the consequences will be dire.

332	Letting your emotions out instead of bottling them up while at the same time honoring a loved one using a tradition of their culture? Man getting closure in a sad time is ridiculous.  Time to reevaluate what you find 'retarded'.	"I know someone that was falsely accused and convicted based on an angsty foster kids accusations.. ruined the guys life, spent years in prison, lost his job, isn't allowed around his own kids even though his wife is still with him (because she knows it was made up)... and based on what the kid told the parents I would still say calling the cops was the right move. Your other choices are to let a possible pedophile continue to try to lure kids, or approach him  yourself with emotions going full bore. 

The police talked to him and he cleared it up. Every pedo is going to deny it so of course they were a little skeptical at first. It really does suck that a childs word has so much power over the life of innocent adults, to truly ruin it, but the alternative of not believing anything any child says without tangible evidence is just as terrifying.

A plasma is a hot ionized gas consisting of approximately equal numbers of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. The characteristics of plasmas are significantly different from those of ordinary neutral gases so that plasmas are considered a distinct ""fourth state of matter.""

Copied from online, I found the following on page 62 of the Naval Research Laboratory Plasma Formulary NRL/PU/6790--11-551, Revised 2011: ""Complex (dusty) plasmas (CDPs) may be regarded as a new and unusual state of matter. CDPs contain charged microparticles (dust grains) in addition to electrons, ions, and neutral gas. Electrostatic coupling between the grains can vary over a wide range, so that the states of CDPs can range from weakly coupled (gaseous) to crystalline. CDPs can be investigated at the kinetic level (individual particles are easily visualized and relevant time scales are accessible). CDPs are of interest as a non-Hamiltonian system of interacting particles as a means to study generic fundamental physics of self-organization, pattern formation, phase transitions, and scaling. Their discovery has therefore opened new ways of precision investigation in many-particle physics."" Crystallinity normally refers to the degree of structural order in a solid. Typical CDP experimental dust temperatures appear to be ~3 x 10^-2 - 10^2 eV.

364	"And although I don’t disagree with you for the most part, I find it important to note that there is value in the focus that games provide *beyond* just being a distraction, that the focus itself can empower some to discover that they even have the capacity for that focus. For some, games provide a social or mental space that is far more than a distraction, but a high functioning aspect of their life that provides a sense of happiness or wellbeing. 

I’m saying that the word “distraction” by definition means: a thing that prevents someone from giving full attention to something else. This very clearly implies a negative connotation, because it is “preventing”. Why does immersion necessitate “prevention of giving attention to something else”? Maybe in a given moment you can only do one thing at a time, but if you have your chores done and you’ve worked on yourself that day to a satisfactory level, then the immersion of games can be a focus in itself, and does not need to be attached to the negativity of being a distraction. It implies you could or should be “doing something else with your time”, which I disagree with as a blanket statement about games. There is plenty of positive value in gaming, and I refuse to say that games are *only* a distraction, if they can be a focus in themselves.

EDIT: Let’s put it this way. Would you say that work is a distraction from fun? Or that fun is a distraction from work? When I hear “distraction,” it implies a pulling away from where attention *should* be. But where attention *should* be can sometimes be nebulous and open, depending on context. I’d say a distraction would be a ball being thrown at a competitor’s head while trying to focus on a fighting game tournament, and you’d say that the tournament itself is a distraction that is keeping participants away from focusing on something else. I think we both actually agree on what a distraction is, but you’re painting things that *can* be a distraction as inherently a distraction by nature (such as relaxing, meditating, watching tv, escaping stress from the day, etc). Getting distracted sounds negative because the definition requires the distraction to be taking the place of something else, and I think *anything* could replace *anything else* as an activity. “My chores are a distraction from finishing this WoW raid” makes as much sense as  “WoW is a distraction from getting my chores done” because both imply a negative comparison, but if those chores are done and WoW is benefitting the individual’s social or mental health at that moment, then I don’t think I’d define it as a distraction, but more as a hobby. A hobby can be passionate and rewarding, and doesn’t always need to be compared to whatever else you could/should be doing. And now we’re talking philosophy.
"	"&gt; Disney wanting to stop the damage against the StarWars brand. 

This is *exactly* saving face. I didn’t say explicitly it was Disney, although that is the case. I said they did it to save face, and they did, for Disney and Star Wars, and by demand. Saving face = protecting brand, brand = Star Wars. EA structured that garbage the way they did because they figured they’d get away with it (and they practically did), but I think it’s also safe to say that they’d have a larger and more consistent playerbase with a F2P game instead of charging $60.

 Jim Sterling is just repeating the same thoughts I’ve had about the future of the game industry that I’ve had since I pondered while sorting the game wall in my time as a GA at Gamestop. Digital Distribution was “the future” back then in 2008, and now it’s just reality. What Jim says about physical games being just a novelty at this point is entirely true. I buy physical games when they are cartridges for Nintendo systems. That’s it. My Xbox, PS4 and PC are all DL only. Within the last 10 years, Gamestop has transformed into a toy store with devices and hardware and customer loyalty as their main sources of income. They sell shirts and Mega Bloks and mugs now. They *print out your game purchases on reciepts*, and their trade business has been in such decline that they’ve resorted to taking in old vintage games again. I warned my manager it would happen, and within 4 years he was laid off because the company made sweeping cuts. It’s a result of a business model that aided in its own destruction by hurting developers by recycling games around a parasitic “circle of life”. I watched people trade in games for $15 store credit, we’d turn around and sell it for $55, and the next guy in line would buy it, when in reality the customers could have cut a deal with each other for $30 and both walked away twice as happy. /rant

Point is, the $60 game structure is entirely a relic of the past. They should reconsider it.

But hell, i’d pay $60 for a damn good single player campaign.

EDIT: Obviously by “they should reconsider the price point” I’m talking about the developers, not Gamestop. I’m well aware of who sets the price points. My point going into talking about Gamestop was to reflect on the industry *as a whole* and how it has changed in terms of distribution. Games were $60 for a long time partially because there was a trade economy leaching off of it."	IAmA	Games	1

He believes that the psychological boost of seeing cards get knocked down is more valuable to the person paying them off in the actual numerical benefits of paying off bigger loans and higher interest rates first.

The fact that we have not done it yet should not be used as an example to how well we are coping.

Another important thing that gets overlooked when comparing peaceful times of old is the many things that is now capable of ending the world. In old times you had almost no way to fuck up on a grand scale. 

Today, a scientist in a basement in Chile can invent a gene that could wipe out a generation while a tech company in China could invent intelligent AI that could ultimately destroy us all. All these small chances of something going globally wrong amps up the likelihood of *something* going awry somewhere soon.

So, even though science, overall living standards and world peace is at an all time high, we shouldn't inherently think we are better off. Quite the contrary.

392	"That is a frighteningly authoritarian worldview that frankly might fit in a country like Canada, or much of Western Europe where it's assumed that the government has the role of ensuring a nice peaceful and happy society for everyone to live in...

But.  That's not the philosophy of the United States.  We are not some big cohesive collective with structure and goals of shaping society over time into something specific decided by experts or a consensus of the population.  We're simply a loose collection of individuals pursuing our own aims, protected by a very wide range of rights that we are born with and are literally above the ability of the government to restrict.  The government exists to enforce those rights, and absolutely nothing more.  It's not a guardian, nor a guiding force, nor a force for change."	"A lot of the reason for the heavy weight given to such an old piece of writing is that the bill of rights portion was created to reflect a set of rights that were to be recognized by the new government being formed, but not granted by that government. Simply recognized as rights that man has always had, granted by his creator and in the past frequently infringed upon by existing systems of government at the time.  

The founders were trying to avoid the flaws of other countries at that time were prone to exhibiting.  They saw tendencies for example, of democracy to turn into tyranny of the majority against rights of the individual and when founding the United States sought to make that impossible. 

The key difference in philosophy is that they were founding a system of government that distrusted government. They recognized that a government will inherently try to infringe upon individual rights, and sought to strike a balance that created a government that had as little power to do so as possible while still maintaining something of a cohesive nation capable of repelling outside attack and also being possible for the citizens to overthrow should it stray too far from the original intent.

407	"I have submitted my comment to the CRTC. Not the one pre-written by Open Media, my own.

In it, I also volunteered to travel on my own dime and time to the hearing and speak if I am allowed to.

Here is a draft what I would talk about -- and it differs quite a bit from my comments, that was something else:

The 1997 book by Esther Dyson, Release 2.0 already talked about how the future of ecommerce is selling to the specific online communities. Instead of carpet bombing every site with wine ads, engage with a wine lovers forum and sell to them. Makes tremendous sense. Kathy Sierra has been talking about how the key to success online is creating passionate users since 2004. Astonishingly, the media industry has some of the most passionate users, and the fans get the cold shoulder time and again which turns them to piracy.

An unusually clear example is the music used in the docking scene of the movie Interstellar. This track, Day One Dark, was given as a bonus MP3 on movieticket.com -- but only to those who bought their movie tickets there. Everyone else, the overwhelming majority of fans can not get hold of this truly astonishing track legally. While one can buy various deluxe editions of the Interstellar soundtrack, some of them costing hundreds of dollars, Day One Dark is not on any of them nor is it available as a separate track. Of course, it is on YouTube, Soundcloud et al. Usually when you can't buy a particular piece of music you can only guess a recording must exist but in this specific case you *know* the MP3 is there -- they just decided not to release it. Boggles the mind, really.

Or let's take a look at musicals! Aside from a very small selection, most cast lineups are simply not available for purchase. Again, we know the recordings exist because some sound board recordings leak but these rarely if ever find their way to such public platforms as YouTube rather they are traded in more secretive places. 

Understand well what happens here: the prospective customer is literally told ""we do not want your money"" and so they instead learn to turn to illicit sources. And they will quickly learn to appreciate the bigger selection.

There is a website selling close to 3000 different classic movie DVDs -- all of them pirated, you could say. But it's not like they just take existing DVDs and resell pirated copies. No, they do the digital transfer and often the English subtitling themselves. We aren't talking of obscure indie movies here -- I found them when I wanted to buy a copy of Robert Vernay's 1954 Monte Cristo with Jean Marais in the lead.

Noone cares about old movies? Sure, let's talk about the newest ones then! In South Korea, Video On Demand services will often show movies in high definition still running in theatres. These then will be copied all over the piracy world, famously recognizable from their korean subtitles. So if you are anywhere else in the world, pirates will give you HD copies much earlier than legit copies. And this has been ongoing for quite a few years now.

Do I need to mention how much smaller the selection of Netflix Canada is compared to Netflix USA? Do you think this is because Reed Hastings just doesn't want to offer the same or because the rightsholders doesn't let him?

Indeed, if you want to fight piracy then you should sell what your customers want. I find it astonishing i need to state this but apparently I need to. A personal anecdote: my parents smuggled our first computer into the country I was born in because you couldn't buy one. That was 33 years ago in socialist Hungary. I thought I am now a citizen of a capitalist country, do tell me if I am wrong because then I need to move again.

The videogaming industry now has a long track record of proving this works. Gabe Newell, the founder and CEO of Valve who now controls about 50-75% of the downloadable PC game market said very succinctly: piracy is a service problem. That was in 2011, the same year when Netflix traffic passed torrent traffic in the United States, by the way. In 2012, the author of Minecraft tweeted his fans to pirate his game if they can't afford it and buy it later when they can. Later the game was sold to Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars. The European Union recently released a 306 page report on piracy in the gaming industry, finding ""This positive effect of illegal downloads and streams on the sales of games may be explained by the industry being successful in converting illegal users to paying users"". Let me repeat: Positive effect.

And the media industry is well aware of this. The recent IFPI report also quoted by the FairPlay proposal has this from Warner Music’s Chief Digital Officer Obermann: ""We
know digital services are competing against heavily-used unlicensed players in some markets. But they offer a user experience that pirate services can’t replicate and that is pulling music fans to paying services."" 

On the contrary, do you know what doesn't work? Deploying the powers of the state to fight piracy. The Pirate Bay is still there, thriving and it even returned to its original domain name in 2016. The US government pressured intense legal action against it included seizing some of its hardware, sending the founders to prison, courts blocking it in various jurisdictions. And yet, if you search for pirate bay in Google, in almost every country it's at most one more click away than it was before ""blocking"". There are two exceptions: Turkey and China. Do we want Canada to build Internet controls like those two? Would the Charter and courts upholding it let that happen?

Even the FBI has wisened up long ago how futile this chase is and the last major bust in the USA was in 2005. 

To sum up, I would rather spend my money myself on music and movies instead of having the government spend it on censorship.

Basically, Virgin and BA shared an IT system and BA got staff who had legitimate access to other airline’s data on that system to extract sensitive data. This included load factors (how many people board a flight) which are crucial to running an airline efficiently. The staff they used were those who help customers transfer flights on to different airlines (so you may fly Glasgow to Gatwick on BA and then Gatwick to JFK on Virgin) hence needing access to data. Virgin was quite small at the time and suffered from delays. The people who had access to the Virgin data would share this data with a separate team who would target people transiting to try and get them to change their flight to BA. They would also apparently lie and claim a Virgin flights were delayed/cancelled and offer BA flights as an alternative. 

By most accounts they were specifically targeting high revenue customers who were connecting on to Virgin Upper Class (Business Class, Virgin Atlantic doesn’t offer First Class) by gathering their contact details, flight schedules etc.  It ended up costing BA millions in fines and compensation.

If it did, substitute teachers (who are also legally responsible for the safety and well-being of teenagers) would be revered as sagely elders. "	"One person did this for me when my little brother (4 years younger) was born. They bought me The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. I was so excited because I had been learning to read. I actually managed to read it at 4 &amp; a half-5 years old, just out of pure determination (it was my present, after all, and I was damn well gonna enjoy it!). It sparked a lifelong obsession and now I'm studying to teach literature. As a result, I've followed this LPT with all of my friends' kids. It especially helps if it's an activity thing for the kid, since getting a sibling is often the catalyst for a lot more independent play. The eldest child often gets too much attention from mom &amp; dad to the point where it's suffocating...and then it suddenly drops off when they realize their parenting style is unsustainable. I think that an activity-focused gift is a great way to commemorate the rite of passage into entertaining their own damn selves.

I don't remember feeling entitled to the gift. I remember thinking 'huh, that's weird that I would get a present'. But maybe it helps that it wasn't presented in an appeasing way. It was more of a spontaneous 'here, we saw this and thought you'd like it' gift, which are the best kind of presents. I also don't remember it setting an expectation, because i knew it was a one-off and didn't think I would get stuff on other important occasions.

For people who think this will spoil a child, remember that you can always just get a couple of toys suitable for multiple ages. You don't have to make it explicitly FOR the older kid. He/she'll play with it anyway, and new parents always get too much stuff for newborns. The baby will grow into it. "	relationships	LifeProTips	1

First, there are a bunch of different Medicaid plans, don't think they're all the same because they're not. Some Medicaid plans charge $0.50 per prescription, which is awesome. Others have variable charges that can change for a bunch of reasons. First, many plans have a deductible at the beginning of the year. If your prescription was fully covered in December, it may be $500 in January when your deductible restarts. There's also something called the donut hole. I still don't fully understand how it works, but basically in the middle of the year they may make you start paying again for a while until you get out of the donut hole and into disaster recovery.

There are great arguments in favor of the debt avalanche method with the main one being that it maximizes the amount of money you save when paying off loans. This is incredibly obvious and nobody contests it.

Making a post where you claim that the debt avalanche is the best method to pay off debt and only making the argument from the point of it being mathematically optimal is really silly.

This is the equivalent to going on a weight loss forum and claiming that X diet plan is wrong and all you need to do is cut calories to lose weight...

The people on the forum are actually dealing with real people and real circumstances and trying to find the most optimal solution for that person.

"I'm not a nutritionist/fitness expert, but the way I think about it is this:  Going off the above example, for whatever reason your body thinks it's best to store fat in your mid section. If you get really overweight, you run out of room in the mid section and your body starts storing fat in other areas it doesn't think is ideal, but is forced to do so. 

When you start to lose weight, going off the previous logic, the body starts to burn fat in the storage areas deemed least ideal (neck, arms, and wrists just to fire off some examples). As you lose weight the only fat that's left is in the mid section where the body thinks it's okay to store excess energy. "	MMA	Fitness	1

My state pays for anyone with a good GPA to go to any state university and get any degree (including an art degree i suppose), and that program continues to balloon in expense and is currently in danger because we simply don’t have the money.

The stronger a planet's gravity and the weaker its material, the ~~larger~~smaller the maximum deviation from the perfect hydrostatic equilibrium shape is.

For example, Mars, with gravity only a third as strong as Earth's, has mountains taller and valleys deeper than any you can find on Earth. At the other end of the scale, the gas planets and stars do not really have any permanent deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium (though the hydrostatic equilibrium shape can be deformed from a perfect sphere due to rotation and tidal effects), because of both their strong gravity, and the fact that gases have pretty much zero mechanical strength."

513	"&gt; The king allows this request even though it seems very strange (I mean why hang 10 dead people again, right?).

This doesn't seem strange to me at all. They're hanging up the corpses for public display.

&gt; According to an article on the Purim Codes:The Hebrew word for ""tomorrow"" (""machar"") occasionally refers to the distant future. Further, the Sages tell us that whenever the word ""king"" appears in the Megillah it alludes to the King of kings as well. Thus, the verse could be understood as a request by Esther to G-d to again hang the ten sons of Haman at some point in the distant future.

There's no indication in Esther that the passage refers to any events thousands of years into the future. The 'machar' is tomorrow, as they hang the bodies the next day. 

&gt;  The following suggestion has been made: The large vav refers to the sixth millennium (of the Hebrew calendar); the small letters refer to year 707 of that millennium. The meaning, then, is that G-d agreed to hang Haman's ten sons again in the year 5707 = 1946-7.

Why does a large vav mean ""add 5000 years""? Why not 6? Or 60? Or 600? Or 6000? Is it 5000 from the start of the calendar or 5000 from when Esther spoke?

What about the other two large characters? Why are they being discarded as part of the equation?

Additionally, there are at least 2 other manuscripts of Esther with different sets of large/small letters, which would change the numbers as well.

You can pretty much come up with anything using Bible codes. "	"&gt; I guess I feel like I can give him the benefit of the doubt because I personally haven't witnessed this behavior.

&gt; The rest of your assertions seem rather baseless to me at least.

I do have some serious arguments to sustain that there is a demand to set aside *some* privacy and security concerns for a while to make way for radical innovation. I guess you weren't around when the web was invented. Here are 2 real anecdotes that come in support that we wouldn't have been able to develop web apps and search engines had the DGPR base principles been in force in 1993-94.


When we set our first web server at my university in 1993, the very first application I hacked in a matter of hours was providing access to the University Library catalog. This app was an instant success in the Lab, as it enabled to see if a particular book was checked out and by whom. As most of the time, the same book was borrowed by close colleagues, this made it extremely easy to come by your colleagues to see the chapter you were interested in, saving you a lengthy trip to the library. This was an immediate hit that made the Lab very rapidly aware of the amazing power of the web. Now, at the time, there was no authentication protocol, so the whole world could access these features. Incidentally, this meant that anyone could access anyone else's reading list if given enough patience, which is a huge privacy breach. While these obvious flaws took some time to fix, there was an immediate consensus that the service was so useful people would happily prefer having it than having to wait for the proper web standards to emerge to provide some notion of privacy. It is this sort of flexibility that enabled the web to become what it has. Would it be OK now to hack together this web app? Certainly not. Was it OK then: I'd argue that yes, it was OK, and furthermore it was needed to allow building a collective understanding of both the fantastic enabler that it was, and also enable progressive appropriation of this power to figure what sorts of limits had to be set to make it secure and respectful of personal rights.

The second anecdote occurred a little bit after that, when web crawlers were starting to appear. After much discussion, we ended up setting up the [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html) mechanism to solve some obvious issues, but you have to understand we were working in the dark at the time. Some argued, with good reasons, that a web crawler was actually ethically unacceptable, by interpreting the then recent [Morris worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm) incident. We now understand that if someone leaves some personal data on a web page, and a search engine reveals this information on a simple search no matter how deep and hidden the initial page was, the primary person to blame is the author of the original page. But this was not clear at all at the time.  If search engines were invented only now, in the DGPR context, there is a very high likelihood that they would be considered too invasive and would be forbidden by the DGPR. In all cases, the huge liabilities (3% of a company revenue) assigned to privacy invasion, associated to the ""kafka-esque"" disposition that anything that has not been foreseen by the regulation may expose you to this fine, would have precluded investors to bet on Altavista, google and the other search engines at the time.

I should conclude to say that I do appreciate the importance of the DGPR, and welcome it. I just want to point to important issues in the present situation, and encourage people to think about those shortcomings: Does the DGPR prevent breakthrough innovations to occur at the same pace they had in the 90's and 00's?"

Essential's notch is just for the camera and nothing else so the width is very small even though it's deep into the screen.

Everything that Harvey said, can be repeated verbatim by just about every Chicago male that I know. In fact, this isn't about Harvey really being wrong, it's about how he doesn't conform to modern day's ubiquitous view that everyone is equal and should be treated the same. When presented with a famous black male's point of view that doesn't confirm this viewpoint, he gets ostracized. Which is bullshit. Honestly it is. We are forcefed bullshit agendas by the media and now it is so much a part of us, that you can't be different the other direction (I don't know how to underline but that last part is important). But it goes to show that when growing up in the right place, it doesn't matter what the country teaches, you will believe what your mother has taught you and what your father has beats into you. If you read that right, you'll see what I did there. But the honest truth is that your mother beats it into you worse.

579	"Let me tell you...

Mono. As an adult. 

I committed to a rigorous routine last year. Then  this year, I joined a Tough Mudder team and was training for it all spring. Gym 5 days a week. Surfing the other two days. Then I got hit with Mono in June. Just **getting out of bed** was a struggle many days. 

Exercise and surfing have been such critical components of my mental health, I've been completely depressed over my inability to do what I love.

I'm finally regaining that energy and started working out again but I'm having to ease into it. It's maddening but I learned throughout the last few months that health isn't just about working out. The body occasionally needs rest and rest can be just as important as exercise. I wouldn't drive my car with a bad wheel bearing so why would I treat my body differently? That mindset helped ease the frustration a little. For me, at least."	"While I'd like to believe everything said here, I don't think there is any evidence whatsoever to support it. Perhaps you could provide some sources.

Admittedly - and herein lies the rub - I too have little in the way of evidence to support the claim that misconduct is on the *rise*. Although what studies exist (https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/) certainly indicate a steady increase in arrests for police misconduct. You could interpret that data as an *improvement*, I suppose by saying that police committed offenses are more likely to be prosecuted. Hard to say.

That's the issue though, isn't it? We have no truly rigorous, independent system of oversight. Nor do we have transparency. Data on police misconduct is entirely dependent on departments self-reporting and public perception lately seems to be that people are troubled by the lack of such oversight and transparency. 

Of course, it's a bit unsettling to members of the public like myself when just about every single time a department attempts to implement some oversight - take body cameras for example or use independent prosecutors in cases where police are charged - police unions push back with full force. 

You paint a pretty rosy picture here that apparently, police departments across the country are doing just fine self-policing and that we shouldn't be worried about misconduct. I think a substantial portion of the American voting population would disagree with you."	Fitness	AdviceAnimals	1

Here, at the end of the course you take the exam. The course teaches you the skills to pass the exam but if you fail the exam you don’t get the license. So there is no need to kick OP out of the course, instead let them work on the skills that they need to develop. If OP doesn’t pass the test then no license. But by kicking OP out they’re now on reddit where the first advice they got is go buy a bike and ride it in a parking lot to learn. That sounds much less safe for OP and others than just staying in the course where they are in a controlled environment with gear and instructors. Never mind the inconvenience of trying to transport a bike you can’t legally ride. 	news	motorcycles	1

As for going to a separate room - even ignoring the implausibility that every place should have one - why should moms have to miss out on their meal and company? My kid didn't like being in a quiet room to nurse, he liked being around people unless he was ready for bed. I don't like being in a quiet room to nurse him, it made me fall asleep. 

As for the mess, my kid rarely left a drop behind. I usually nursed him, popped him off my boob and pulled my shirt up at the same time. Not sure why you think that's a problem.

As for comfort, why should YOUR comfort be more important than the baby and moms?  It's entirely possible to avert your gaze of your uncomfortable.

Speaking from Portugal, a much poorer and smaller country with a population that is old:

Our health service, with its flaws, is tons better than the american.

You guys pay a huge price in insurance. With the values you pay per month for normal service, we can get very good private insurance.

The difference is, if you fall on hard times, health issues will not bankrupt you.

It doesn't treat the poor as mere organ donors, it doesn't destroy lives and futures. Its not as good? Ask your poor people how good your system is.

As for the innovation and availability and speed - who cares? That is irrelevant if I can't use it due to price; or if after I get that wonderful fast and amazingly efficient service my life and future is destroyed and I am a slave until I die.

Besides, I have my own business, and one of the reasons I could afford to risk it - with all the irregular payments and difficulties of a new business - is because I knew that if anything happened, health-wise, I'd be covered.

I wouldn't have risked, probably, if that meant that I'd have to choose between health insurance for me and mine and food on the table.

Frankly it is hard to even take the debate seriously. Its like domestic violence victims discussing ways to get your abusers to say please, or smile when they beat and rape the crap out of you. Big improvement, people, but you're still abused.

Btw without insurance or any cards, straight off the street, a root canal over here is about 75€ x 2. Getting an implant is expensive, 750 to 1000. Getting checked out by the eye doctor is 60 to 100, depends. Going to a private clinician about same.

Full operation with a day at the hospital to get some steel in a limb, including anesthetics and stuff, without any insurance and on a private hospital, was 3000 and a bit, including some visits there. Includes ER, all materials and such. Yes, its expensive. But it won't kill you.

And I'll leave you with a quick excerpt from the [Colorist Society International](https://coloristsociety.com/role-of-the-colorist), a known authority in the field of color grading.

&gt;**The term “color grading” describes the process of color image manipulation of moving images.** Colors, their hue and brightness, as well as image contrast can be altered in great detail for the whole image or selected parts in order to create a consistent, creative look for the whole motion picture. Different cameras and aspect ratios can be matched and issues during shooting, like changing weather conditions or different white balances can be solved or smoothed out.

&gt;**Other common but partly incorrect terms for color grading are: color correction, color matching, digital intermediate (DI) and color timing.** The term color timing exclusively describes adjusting the printer light settings in the analog film lab process, which is conducted by color timers."

I can only give my own anecdotes. 

My mom was a high school principal and teacher for 10 years. I can tell you she spent most of the school holidays doing full days at the office, the only difference was she got home a little earlier. During school days she rarely got home before 8pm and was very often still preparing teacher schedules and stuff like that at home. 

Granted part of that was because apparently her deputy principals were useless and she often had to take on a lot of their work. 

My girlfriend is a primary school teacher, she spends most of the holidays finishing marking, because it's not just ticking boxes - students need individual feedback and analysis on how they're doing in various areas. Now multiply that by like 200 students. Also on lesson planning for the next semester because god knows how they're expected to prepare lessons during the school period with everything else going on (remember they have to mark holiday homework when school starts again so they'll have no time). Also finishing paperwork for their department, attending conferences, dealing with parents etc. 

I'm not saying they don't have holidays, and by all means there are careers that have worse hours. And they can often do their work at home during this time, meaning that they do have some capacity to look after children. But the idea that being a teacher is less than a full time job because of school holidays is, in my opinion, absurd.

Food based training creates a unhealthy association between misbehavior and reward, and depending on the breed can often lead to the amplification of aggressive instincts by introducing a resource to guard.

Your attention and vocal praise should always be enough reward, and corrections are required not only to communicate the opposite of praise and attention, but also to relay confidence and hierarchy as an owner. The typical urban landscape is anxiety and distress provoking to dogs, so we as humans are obligated to reassure the dog of our place within that environment and our comfort with the cacophony of sensory input that the dog is experiencing to a heightened degree. 

Treating can be a useful tool, but is ultimately better for the human than it is for the dog. Humans don’t deserve dogs, so we should do everything in our power to nurture them on their terms - given that they spend every moment nurturing us on our terms.

"Colossians 2:18 states do not let anyone disqualify you based on asceticism...  this is a word meaning performing works to get praise.  It is like saying “hey look how great I am and how humble I am.”  Unfortunately when one is showy about how humble they are by definition they are not humble.  Christians are to give (all they have or part of what they have) in secret.  Giving to others is not for the praise of men but for the glory of God.  
Can you give all you have without love?  Yes!  There are many in my church that give greatly just to receive praise.  They want to give and then direct how the money is used.  If one has an issue with how the organization spends money, don’t give to them.  If the Church is doing God’s work, let them do what God is directing them to do.  
My church had a youth director that sold all he had.  He and his family (wife and four children) are now missionaries in south east Asia.  It is also possible to sell all you have in love.  This is not a theoretical conversation, it does happen.  
It is easy to see if the person is genuine in their love for others or if they are trying to show how humble they are.

"Maybe it's easier to see the difference if you think about subtractive mixing as absorption, not reflection. I.e. if you additively mix red and green, you get light that is a mix of red and green wavelengths. But if you mix red and green paint, you have one paint that absorbs (mostly) everything that isn't red and everything that isn't green respectively. You cannot use any 3 colours for this because of the way the human eye works. For example, magenta triggers both blue and red receptors in the human eye, cyan triggers blue and green. If you mix cyan and magenta paint, both paints reflect blue light, but the mixture will absorb both red and green, giving you blue. If you mix green and red instead, both paints absorb blue, and mixture absorbs green and red as well. If your receptors were very precise, that would give you black, but because human colour vision is significantly skewed, you get brown. Similarly, additive mixing doesn't work with arbitrary colours: if you mix red and green, you get yellow (because that is what you perceive when red and green receptors are triggered). But if you mix cyan (B+G) and magenta (B+R) you already get a mostly white perception, because all three receptor types are being triggered.

The key here is not the bias of the human vision toward green, it's that your colour perception is the result of three (mostly) discrete colour receptors."	unitedkingdom	askscience	1

685	"Here in the US it seems like people, as well as some of the large news outlets, tend to see smaller internet-based news sources as outright fabrications or indescribably biased sources not worth exploring.  Regardless though, there have been multiple occasions in which those ""fake news"" outlets broke stories that larger corporate news entities initially deemed to be nothing more than conspiracy theories before, begrudgingly, recanting their reports and admitting that the stories were indeed true.

I feel that the obviously biased coverage during our last presidential election, and the conflicting (yet corroborated) truth brought to light by WikiLeaks around the same time, has shown that the interest of major media outlets isn't to provide the truthful, unbiased reporting that used to be the standard to which they were held.  It truly seems like sensationalism is the rule of the day because that's what generates viewership, and thus revenue.

So my questions are: Do you think that the smaller independent news outlets are worth regarding; and do you think their existence and ability to function outside the umbrella of the corporate giants it the reason they take so much heat from the likes of CNN, MSNBC, and FOX news - as though being discredited by a corporate giant means the reporting is less reliable?"

Over the course of several major patches near the end of BFA, have N'Zoth's/Void Lords/big bad's army sweep over the various continents of Azeroth several zones at a time (so they could creep up from the south of each continent and move north) Dalaran/Outland/Draenor are obviously not affected, and can be used by players as 'home bases' and rally points.
Each Zone has control points (major towns, or geographical features) that the players have to defend with faction support.  
Should the bad guys hold more control points  in a region than players for more than a week, the zone is considered 'lost'. The different servers all contribute towards the final determination of whether a zone is lost or not, so if more than 50% of servers successfully defend the Swamps of Sorrows, it stays safe.    
Each major patch - the lost zones are turned into dangerous areas (full of elites and bosses). WoW 2.0 can then feature something where we reclaim these lost areas or something.  
Players can donate resources (similar to the warfront leadups) to assist in the fight.  


This is obviously off the top of my head, but I've always liked how GW ran those global campaigns for their WH40K and WHFB lines, so it'd be interesting to do something similar, as well as allow players to influence a little of the story.

WoW's grouping experience revolves around Tank, Healer and DPS roles \- GW2 has none of this, even though some classes lean towards a certain role.

SNL has a thousand shitty sketches but they easily have 50+ classics.

But I've yet to see a school in the city with restrictions on where you can wait to pick your kid up. Or with teachers who roam the playground looking for lone adults, but maybe your niece goes to a very small school and they can do that. 

She made that walk regularly alone, without incidence. The father himself said that. Many kids likely do. Many do the world over (see latchkey kids) and this has existed for years, much like child molesters and murderers. 

The high likelihood is this was a local adult, likely someone she knew and felt she could trust. Attacks are rarely by strangers.

The only real risk is herpes, and the risk of passing it in is minimal. Less than 1% if using a condom and not during an active outbreak. The chance of her having genital herpes is quite small (about 10 to 15% of the population have it), more for oral herpes, but you're at the same risk for that (80% of the population have it by 40 according to the WHO).

"	"Our pretty good grasp on chemistry allows us to say that hypothetical Martian life was almost certainly carbon-based. Complex silicon, phosphorus, and boron compounds tend to explode at liquid water temperatures. If we see silicon-based life, for example, we'd expect to see it in a very low temperature environment with a solvent like liquid nitrogen; it would also be biologically important in a very high temperature environment where silica (quartz) is liquid.

Exotic life is certainly possible - even probable, given recent study into the chemical dynamics of Titan. But in ancient Martian conditions, which would have been similar to our own, we have no theory which would predict life that wasn't based on complex carbon chemistry with water as a solvent. 

But that doesn't rule out interesting findings - any discovery of life on Mars would be interesting in its own way:

* Discovery of life that shares many common characteristics with Earth life, like use of RNA, DNA, and molecules of the same chirality, would suggest a common origin - and since Mars became friendly to complex carbon chemistry before Earth did and it's easier for debris to go from Mars to Earth than the other way around, that origin is more likely to be Mars than Earth.

* Discovery of life that has very different biochemistry would strongly suggest different origins, and strongly support theories of a life-filled universe - the anthropic principle requires us to set aside Earth as evidence (we are living observers, so it is unremarkable that our planet supports life), but if our closest neighbor has life without a common ancestor, it makes it much more likely that other places have life, too - the likelihood that the only two places in the galaxy that life independently evolved are Earth and Mars is infinitesimal.

* Discovery of life that largely shares our biochemistry but uses molecules of the opposite chirality would open a debate, because it kind of supports both points of view. (It might also intensify research into [manganese-rich desert varnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_varnish), which is interesting because the most plausible explanation for the manganese enrichment is biological, but we've looked fairly carefully and haven't found any microbes in it. Some have suggested that it's because the microbes are of opposite chirality, so our methods of looking for microbes wouldn't have found them.)"	asoiaf	science	1

Secondly...and maybe I’m just being stupid here- but Bezos usually leans left when he’s not directly protecting his stockholders.  If Amazon’s stock price falls enough, people will try to buy him out with a hostile takeover.  I do not want to see Amazon in the hands of someone like the Koch brothers, and I’m pretty sure that is what would happen if Amazon changed hands.  I don’t know if that is even possible, but it’s something I worry about with most of the mega corps.  What happens if someone far less moral takes the reins?

When I boycott I either make sure it’s making a statement but not actually doing damage, or I make sure I’m okay with the alternatives.  Getting people to boycott Amazon would not be a success if everyone shopped at Walmart instead.  And I never want to see someone like Trump owning controlling interest in Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc.  The idea is terrifying.  So I write letters and protest and vote with my dollars...but in the end, I’m happier with who is in charge of them now than who I think would end up in charge if they were forced out.

It's playing with carbs and water at the same time. Glucose attracts 4x its weight in water.

Sometimes it's just 24 hours sometimes 48. But dropping carbs the week before and bringing them back a few days before helps ""soak"" up the water by storing the carbs in the liver and muscle. You stop right before you spill over and get subq glucose storage which will pull the water subq which you don't want.

When you first decide on an action you want to perform, you know what the desired end result is, but you don’t know the exact muscle movements required to make it happen.

For example, juggling:  
When you first start learning, you fumble and drop them all the time. Through practice and repetition, your brain builds up an unconscious memory of the exact sequence of muscle movements required to juggle successfully.  
The end result of this is a sort of “executable” stored in your subconscious that’s activated autonomously whenever you need to perform that action, instead of needing to learn it all over again.  
You decide you’re going to juggle, so your subconscious runs *juggle.exe.*

Our ability for automatization like this is actually extremely fascinating when you think about it.  
It’s beyond the capacity of most other organisms.  
It allows our lower subconscious to “take the wheel,“ so to speak, when performing trivial actions, while our conscious mind can engage in all sorts of complex tasks while our body works automatically in the background.

They did a lot of great things, but the raw feeling of control, momentum, skill based traversal, is severely numbed here.

There's also no sense of accomplishment. Before I'd have to angle my swings, use my limited range wall runs and web zips, and eventually get to the top of the empire State building. It felt good and it felt like I earned the view. In this game I just hold R2 and he sprints up to the top in 5 seconds, running over obstacles automatically.

For lateral movement there are so many zips, launches, direct to Target movements that traditional web swinging almost feels redundant and slow.

"I've read enough analysis and argued through enough points that I've gone from despising the movie to respecting it and understanding *almost* every move that was made that I initially thought was bad.

That doesn't change the fact that I and half the fans were upset upon walking out of the theater the first time. If that's the reaction to your movie then you've missed a step somewhere. Even if there is a good argument behind every controversial choice you make, it shouldn't take a conscious effort in order to enjoy Star Wars.

My final opinion is that EP.9 will make or break TLJ. If 9 is lightning in a bottle and in part thanks to the plot freedom and character development provided by the writing of TLJ, then TLJ can be timeless as most controversies will prove good for the sake of the next movie and like I said many of the others can simply be explained. If ep9 is poor or mediocre and has to retread old ground because TLJ wiped the board clean, then it will go down as a mess that scewed with the lore, the trilogy arc, and trolled the fans.

I look forward to finding out. (and if you're wishing you could appreciate the movie more in the mean time I'm happy to lend the positive perspectives I've found about many of the widely disliked parts of the film)

816	"&gt;because he thinks it's right and proper for a man to be manly; because other people pressure him into it.

Well, from what is gathered from patriarchy and the way families used to work and still do mostly, is that youre manly, when you take responsibility for the work that a man had to do at a time: Being a proper adult, containing emotions, working hard, doing your best to raise children properly as a father figure and standing up for rights, be it either privately, or by going to war.

At the same time, womanly for that standard would be raising your children properly as a mother, being caring and civilizing men.

Obviously, this is still a good idea, and surprisingly, women still seem to like children opposed to working. But that on a side note. Just wanted to clarify that there are gender roles that have to be enforced by society, because they are important.

I think if that is the general definition, men should be pressured to be like that. When we talk about interests and hobbies and smaller things, then it could be a problem, if we try to force people to conform like that, for example, if a boy really wants to play with barbies, let him. 

&gt;If you're a guy who likes dolls, and people loudly insist you must be a woman and go date straight guys and lesbians, just because you like dolls, you're gonna be seriously weirded out.

Obviously, and thats not cool.

&gt;We have the technology, but it's still very experimental.

We have a basis already, so it will go faster and faster.

At the end, we dont know enough yet. But since the Bible doesnt tell us, its bad to become a women or the other way around, or defines what gives it, i am not opposed to a man fully becoming a women somehow. And i am not opposed to having other interests, than is normal for that gender. Im not even opposed to calling people he or she, when they do think they are a women or a men.

Inside a classroom, your viewpoint that a concept is incorrect isn't valid until you can demonstrate you understand what the concept itself is. If you can't explain what a social construct is, you can't argue that social constructs don't exist. Within a class, it's the professor's job to (1) teach you a set of disciplinary norms and (2) make sure you understand those disciplinary norms. If you walk away disagreeing with those norms, that's fine! But inside the classroom, your first job is to demonstrate that you understand what they are. 

Personally, I would have no issue with a student writing an essay that answered the question and then explained why they disagreed with a concept in the question.

You will fight many battles, lose often, but it's worth it! It's difficult to fight, because it will probably never really change. 

Other family members will not always support you, because for them it may be easier to give in. Family members like brothers and sisters have their own history, their relationship with that parent, and may not have the force to find their way out.

824	"Catholicism has been more morally consistent with ""pro-life"" as they object to abortion and capital punishment. 

White, evangelical Protestants are good with capital punishment. Opposition to abortion came very recently in their history. Remember that abortion was illegal until 1973 so there were no evangelicals speaking out about it until then. Though 1970s opposition after Roe v Wade increased among the community. Interestingly, in 1976 it was not much of an issue with evangelicals who supported Jimmy Carter. By 1980 their interest had become stronger. Jerry Falwell campaigned against it. Not as a moral issue so much for saving babies but as a moral argument against the ""permissive"" environment created by Roe. Reagan leveraged their support by expressing his opposition to abortion, although in the end he did little for the movement.

Through the 1980s and 1990s the Catholic and evangelical churches found common cause, and also found greater political clout by working together on this issue (traditionally evangelicals hated Catholics). 

Combining the political strength of Northeast and Midwest Catholics with the bloc of southern evangelicals they became the new force to be reckoned with by Republicans and Democrats.

"I used to be part of a group called ‘food not bombs’. We fed the homeless in Florida through donations from local restaurants and we were constantly being harassed by the police. City council eventually passed a law stating that you were unable to publicly feed more than 15 people at local parks.

Once this law was passed the police department would have plain clothes police officers in different parks throughout the city on days that they knew we would be handing out food. The officer would watch from a distance and once they saw that we had fed more than 15 people he would swoop in and shut us down, while writing us a ticket and on some occasions arresting our volunteers.

Think about that, this country would rather spends thousands of taxpayer dollars to set up police sting operations, and change our towns laws to attack us, instead of helping us feed the homeless or at the very least just leave us alone and let us do our thing.

It’s pretty funny too, because the police officers and city council members almost all had ‘support our troops’ bumper stickers, and city council members would constantly talk about helping our veterans when they were running for election.

There are great arguments in favor of the debt avalanche method with the main one being that it maximizes the amount of money you save when paying off loans. This is incredibly obvious and nobody contests it.

Making a post where you claim that the debt avalanche is the best method to pay off debt and only making the argument from the point of it being mathematically optimal is really silly.

10	"Yes, each pixel is a time signal. You can represent any finite discrete time series as discrete fourier samples, or any integral continuous time sample as a fourier transform function.

The problem here is that this representation does not compress the redundancy present in video very well. Fourier samples compress a static image well through high frequency precision discarding (where you store more precisely the lower frequencies). If you did the same to the temporal axis of a moving picture, you would get bluriness in moving objects and certain odd ringing phenomena. Also, this process would not be able to compress a common situation that is a translating object in the scene. In the time domain it's easy to detect moving objects and encode the (object, velocity) information allowing very good extrapolation and hence compression. Imagine it, for example, as storing a picture of a ball and its vector velocity, and simply displacing it every frame the given velocity (if the movement is uniform then you get extremely good compression).

The basis of compressibility is twofold: 

1) Exploiting the limits of human senses and which artifacts humans don't mind (e.g. we can't distinguish past certain framerate/resolution) -- that's what discerns lossy compression; 

2) Exploiting the limited variability (i.e. compact distribution) of signals, in particular given starting information. If I give you the first frame of a video, it's not like anything else could come next (with high probability -- anything could come but certain nonsense is very unlikely), what comes next is almost always extremely predictable. Computationally efficiently predictable patterns are thus used to limit the data that needs to be encoded within the restricted predicted set, or as an error signal between the prediction and the true outcome (this error signal being small for predictable signals)."	I can detect LED flicker up to about 4khz with rapid eye movement (of a bright, point-like LED source in a dark-ish environment). It needs to be at least 8khz to be totally imperceptible to me. Up to about 500Hz-1khz you can clearly see strips in the persistance-of-vision trail of the LED light with rapid eye movement (especially for duty cycles below 50%). Above that it's still perceptible but as a jagged edge. It's actually very common to find sources with PWM in the range of ~150Hz, which are quite annoying when e.g. you're in a car an get slightly confused by the apparent multitude of lights.	askscience	explainlikeimfive	1

There is clear evidence that child trafficking is a worldwide industry.

And it is used by large capital interests, primarily to entrap and blackmail people in power, including politicians, businessmen, the media, and even the police. If you’re wondering why our governments seem to continually serve large corporate interests instead of their voters, this is one of the reasons.

40	"I'm an RF engineer. The frequency at which a microwave oven operates is fixed for several reasons. One is that the frequency is optimized at the resonant frequency of the water molecule to maximize the energy transfer to the food. The second is that the magnetron is a tuned cavity resonator, so it would be impractical to modulate the frequency because its output frequency is determined by the dimensions of the cavities. The third is that the magnetron gets RF energy into the oven cavity via a waveguide and horn antenna, which is also a narrow band device if you want to transfer the maximum amount of RF power without absorbing it or reflecting it back into the source. Older microwave ovens, and some commercial ovens have a hidden ""stirrer"", which is a reflective metal fan blade that sits in the output horn of the waveguide and reflects some of the energy around the oven cavity to even up the power transfer. Other ovens use a somewhat more effective turntable to move the food instead. Some food is just really difficult to heat evenly if the water content isn't distributed in a homogeneous manner, so in that case it works better to use a lower power setting and a longer cook time. It is also better to place the food off-center on the turntable."	I grew up in the forest but live in the city now for my job.

47	"Honestly, for me sex is all about the foreplay. Penetration and pumping and orgasm are the final chapters of a long story. Think in terms of music. For instance, for something almost everyone can relate to, take the [main theme from Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D0ZQPqeJkk).

It is 5:51 long. The finale starts at 5:17, and follows a slower part that hints at things to come. The whole theme up until the finale is like that, a build up, a promise, and a softening and contemplation, followed by another slightly more powerful buildup, and so on. Then at 5:17 you get metals and a slower build up and a long note accompanied by drums , the note gets interrupted while the drums keep you in suspense, then the note picks up again, long, insisting, and finally ends in a very satisfying cymbal BANG!

For me, foreplay is the 5:16 that comes before the finale. During this time I've made my partner crazy and brought her almost to orgasm a few times, and to actual orgasm a few times. Then during the finale I'm actually pumping and we are together, and that final, insistent note is my own orgasm, hopefully accompanied by another one of hers. The finale is so good, so satisfying, so promising, because of what came before (pun not intended).

Without the foreplay, the finale is still interesting, but it does not compare to the whole symphony. If a sexual encounter would last, say, 45 minutes, then the in-and-out is the last 5 minutes and feels much better because of the 40 minutes that happened before."

I think you can have a news outlet that never once prints a false word, but because of its bias implies conclusions for its readers that are not true. For instance, imagine a conservative news outlet that reports on every crime committed by a Muslim. Each individual headline of ""Muslim refugee commits sexual assault"" or whatever it is may be factually true. But by reporting extensively on crimes committed by Muslims, and ignoring identical crimes committed by other groups, the outlet is implying a conclusion for its readers (Muslims commit more crimes) that is false.

My example was for conservative media, but of course I also think liberal media does a similar thing. In your view would this still be considered truthful reporting?"	news	IAmA	1

50	"A few years back I was just starting work at this not so great paying job, still hurting from the joblessness, and I went in to get gas. The gas station was kind of a mob scene, and it took like 20 minutes to get to the register and everyone was just kind of annoyed and a little rudish. I got to the front of the line and asked for $5.00 in gas, which at the time was like $4.00 a gallon. I think I had to use a dollar in quarters too. Just enough to get to work where I would get paid and get more gas later.

I was pumping gas and finished and put the pump back when it immediately beeped and said ""prepaid $10"" on the screen. I assumed it was an accident and started to get in my car when this woman starts screaming from across the parking lot and waving her hands ""You've got extra gas! You got 10$ more!"". I thought she was trying to say that she accidentally put the 10$ on my pump and thought I pumped it (I didn't). She kept saying it like that for a  few more times and finally walked closer and said ""I paid for $10 more gas for you!"" which is when it hit me, she didn't do it by accident, she was trying to give me a break and help me out.

She explained that she knows how little gas $5.00 is and how she's had to buy just enough gas for the day before too, and just thought I was really polite even though the whole store was full of angry people. I teared up and thanked her profusely.

It made my day and I've never forgotten it. I think of her probably every time I pump gas. I've since paid it forward in similar ways and those small acts of generosity really show on peoples faces when you can tell they are struggling. I always wished I had her contact information so I could pay her back, or show her my appreciation somehow."	This is how people get accused of sexual harassment and the like.

56	"That sucks so bad. I think that kind of violation is a type of sexual assault.
I think it's weird and shitty that we're talking about how and when we wear dresses, how we choose undergarments for dresses, and tips on how to cover our private areas.
Ladies, we all cover our bits when we wear dresses. That's what the fucking dress does. It's clothing. If someone goes under you, they're trying to bypass your clothing and are violating your personal space to do so.
Design a glass catwalk over a busy hotel lobby? You're violating people's personal space, same as hiding under the stairs.
If we choose to wear longer dresses or different underlayers when we wear short dresses for vigorous activies, that's due to our own personal sense of privacy.
E.g. I don't wear ankle pants. Hate them, I have swollen ankles all the time and I look gross in ankle pants. Sometimes I choose to wear shorts or dresses anyway, like when it's hot or if I'm feeling fashiony. What I cover and what I show is a personal choice.
Undergarments are a personal choice. As long as our genitals aren't visible to everyone, then we've covered our body to the acceptable societal standard. Grey sweatpants with our doodle somewhat outlined? Technically OK. Short dress no panties but we're walking around not bending over? Technically OK. Keeping it technically OK is our only OBLIGATION.
Wearing lingerie/booty/tap/boxer/yoga/bike shorts under our dress, for doing normal activity, is a CONCESSION.
Us sitting here and trading tips on our favorite way to make that concession is understandable but feels icky. OP did her obligation: she wore technically OK clothing. Let's point the blame where it belongs: with pervs.
WE shouldn't have to make concessions. We do, for different reasons, including fear. Don't you all get sick of making concessions?
Guys make concessions too (not usually to pervy women). We all struggle with concessions and obligations. Not just a woman thing but in terms of sheer numbers, concessions to pervs is very much part of the women's experience.
So OP I'm sorry you got perved on in such a gross way. Target has great cameras and you should follow up, maybe they have a face shot to share with police. I'd consider warning other local shoppers too, e.g. via word of mouth or with an anonymous tip to the newspaper."

I think you are stuck on considering being rich and comfortable as the ultimate reward of karma. If the ultimate goal of Indian religions is to reach Moksha, then surely being rich is not the defining factor.

The story of Buddha was that he was born in great wealth, but he deliberately abandoned it in order to achieve nirvana. He literally was a beggar. I know that isn't Hinduism, but surely you could see that being overly attached to material wealth can cause suffering in itself.

Given all the stories from his college and high school friends about his heavy drinking, I'd be amazed if he never drank to blackout ever in his life.

"I think its a dead end to believe these moral failures are rooted in religion, there certainly is a correlation but I just don't think its implying causation. People hate gay people because they are disgusted by the idea of homosexuality, which is a disgust possibly rooted in natural selection, you certainly can hate gay people without any believe in any deity. Its just an easy justification for your conservative moral views. Also it is hard to differentiate between politically motivated violence and religiously motivated violence because the latter might not even really exist, religion is oftentimes just an easy political scapegoat and the rest is tribalism not religious.

I think if you want to understand why there is so much vile muslim terrorism a much more effective way than blaming a world religion (because really whats even the point?) would be to recognize what wretched evil imperialist cunts, we the west are to coincidentally mostly muslim countries. And it is easier to explain the widespread human rights violations in all muslim majority states are due to an extreme form of widespread conservatism than their particular version of the death cult they force feed their children with.

Combine it with constant dosages of adrenaline that the illness is causing and it results in a mild oxygen starvation while heart is pumping hard.

&gt;""I am laughing inside,” Nurmagomedov said. “You broke window? Why? Come inside. You know UFC don’t let you come inside. If you real gangster why don’t you come inside?

&gt;""This is big history gangster place. Brooklyn. You want to talk to me? Send me location. We have to talk? I am gonna come, no problem.

&gt;""I grew up like this. I don’t grow up throwing chairs at window. This is not my bus.”

&gt;Following Thursday’s media day at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., McGregor, as well as members of his team, entered the arena. According to sources with knowledge of the situation, they arrived in “retaliation” against Nurmagomedov and his team cornering Artem Lobov, a teammate and good friend of McGregor’s, earlier in the week. Bad blood has been brewing for months between both camps.

McGregor seems to be getting in over his head here."	OP I highly recommend to watch the final episode of the latest season and work backwards from there to S01 Episode 1. 	MMA	AskMen	1

133	"&gt; The exploit description makes it seem like the downloaded resources aren't code signed by Blizzard?

The exploit description doesn't mention anything about pushing downloaded resources to the client through the Blizzard app.  From what it says:

&gt; Exploitation would involve using network drives, or setting destination to ""Downloads"" and making the browser install dlls, datafiles, etc

Looks like the exploit here is to force the payload into the browser's download directory (or, probably, more easily into the browser's cache directory), then repointing the Blizzard app to think that's where a game is installed and asking the app to launch it.  Their 'fix' is to make it so the client doesn't believe any browser executable is a game, so the app can't be used to launch and send command-line arguments to a browser in order to further instrument an intrusion (e.g., having the browser download a payload that the app can then execute in a separate command).

Blizzard's app only downloads content via Blizzard's CDN (which is basically Bittorrent-based) and directed via catalog files served up from their own servers, so the attack here isn't forcing the app to download an arbitrary payload.  The attack here is tricking the app into *executing* an already-downloaded payload because the app doesn't verify that what it's asked to execute is genuine Blizzard code, it just trusts whatever's in the 'game directory'."	"The functionality has been in Chrome for a few releases now, what's changing in Chrome 66 is that it's being enabled *by default*.

If you're using Chrome today and want to turn it on, you can go to `chrome://flags`, search for the flag titled ""Autoplay Policy"" and change its setting to ""Document user activation is required"".

Since mid-October, Chrome has been keeping track of which sites you regularly watch video on and if you both visit a site regularly *and* regularly allow videos with sound to play for more then 7 seconds, Chrome will allow that site to continue to autoplay video.  (This is to allow sites like YouTube and Netflix to continue to work like you want them to.)   You can view Chrome's statistics on how often you watch video on a site by going to `about://media-engagement`.  Any row with ""Is High"" that reads 'Yes' will be able to autoplay videos.

Also, this autoplay policy only applies to videos that aren't muted.  Muted videos, or videos without sound will continue to be able to autoplay.  This also applies to *any* sound by the webpage -- pages won't be able to make sound until you interact with them by clicking on them.

Also keep in mind some sites, like CNN, use some underhanded tricks to get around this autoplay restriction (by not actually navigating to a new page when you click a link; but instead just swapping out the *current* page's content) so they'll still be able to 'autoplay' on everything *except* the first page you visit until Chrome comes up with some plan to address that behavior.   For sites like that, you can permanently mute them by right-clicking on the tab and choosing ""Mute site"", which will persist between visits.  (You can undo ""Mute site"" by clicking on the icon at the left edge of the address bar and changing the permissions for Sound back to ""Use global default"".)   In those cases, video will still play, but it won't be allowed to make any sound."	programming	technology	1
134	"Well reducing my contribution to animal suffering and improving my environmental impact seem like good goals to me, and avoiding animal products greatly contributes to those goals. If those aren't values of yours then of course I can't force you to care about them. My intention is only to inform and encourage others to make what I view as good choices.

You're right that a vegan who wants to reduce suffering, but chooses to drink coffee from a source that harms the environment and monkeys, would be making a choice that does not align with their values. Again, I would encourage you to bring that up to people and fight for others to consider the source of their coffee (or even abstain from coffee if you feel that is right.) That's seem like sound logic and I applaud you for advocacting for positive change in the world.

The only thing I would caution you from doing is using another persons hypocrisy as a reason to negate the good things that those people are doing. It's a reason to inform and encourage them to be better, but it's not reason for you to avoid the positive things that those people are advocating."	"Yeah I agree there is often an un-intuitive difference between how someone feels and how they act. It's something I noticed a lot with animals as I went vegetarian and then vegan.

I won't argue that people don't *feel* love for animals in general. I'd just argue that killing animals when you have a choice not to kill them isn't how you should *act* when you love animals.

It's like a father who abandons his children will often say he still loves them. I don't doubt he still cares for them in plenty of ways. He has just done absolutely nothing that would prove that. In fact he has acted the opposite of how someone who loves their children should *act*.

The discrepancy people have in regards to animals is that people often ""love animals"" only because of how animals make them feel. They love animals because they are silly, interesting, cute, etc. Or even how they taste. They love animals for the feelings animals give them.

My main point is that if you truly love animals you should do what is in their best interest. You should *act* like you love animals and not just say it. Stop hurting, killing, and eating them and choose plant-based options if it's possible."	aww	WTF	1

that

of

This is entirely wrong. Open source uses copyright as an  enforcement mechanism for the provisions in the license. Ask RMS - here is not in favor of removing copyright because then there is no way to stop people from taking open source code and using it in closed source applications, and no way to compel them to release updates too their derivative copy of the codebase.

Without copyright, I could take the linux kernel, make a bunch of modifications to it, then release the binary and you'd have no way to force me to release my changes.

169	"Nothing will ever stop begging. 

If I'm being honest, though, after running 3 mythics back to back and not seeing a single piece of gear (I'm only ilvl 332 so basically anything would be an upgrade) I miss group loot. It's a real slap in the face. 

Edit- rant starts after this

It was hard enough getting into mythics as a 330 arms war. Everyone wanted achievement links for 335/340+. Where do you fuckers think people get gear? How do you think they get achievements? This shit has been out for two weeks, and it's your braindead asses standing in fire. The amount of times I've read the dungeon guide in game to tell someone how to do something after they barely let me into a run for my first time is ridiculous. 

So as much as I think loot is something that needs attention, I think a much bigger problem is the false elitism that has seemed to take the fan base by storm. 

All that aside, I have still somehow enjoyed this xpac a great deal, so I guess something is right in all of this. Maybe the struggle makes it fun/feel accomplishing. Who really knows?"	Was reading further up in the thread. There's a theory that for some animals, like whales (I'm going to paraphrase a lot here), they are so big that a tumor will grow on their cancer tumor before it reaches lethal size, and that second tumor will kill the first one. Essentially their cancer gets cancer before it can kill them. From what else I read, whales have some tumor suppressing genes. There's a theory someone mentioned up there that is based off of the fact that larger animals technically should get more cancer than us, but proportionally don't. It's still an open field. 	wow	science	1

174	"Frankly, we don't know at all what Mueller has. We do know that everyone around manafort was offered a plea deal, which says to me Mueller is not interested in flipping him. Manafort is corrupt enough that Mueller decided he was a one of the primary targets of the investigation. This trial is showing that judgment to be well considered. 

  I honestly don't think Mueller needs manafort to prove collusion. Just yesterday Trump admited in a foolhardy PR move that Trump Jr, manafort, kushner, Cohen and others met with someone they knew was connected to the Russian government for dirt on Clinton at Trump tower. That's proof of collusion, he admitted on Twitter no less. He admitted to something like 4 crimes, right there, and no amount of saying ""its not illegal"" in a tweet will change the law. 

Just from public data(trumps tweets, Trump Jr's emails, Cohen statements, etc) from the people involved, collusion is clear. Mueller likely has facts, evidence and testimony we can't imagine.  Of course, we will have to wait and see, but flipping manafort is likely not his concern at all. "	VLC can file a dmca takedown request for copyright infringement.

Just because you don't know the answer doesn't mean there isn't one. It also doesn't mean ""God did it"" is the right answer, although it could be (I don't deny the possibility of God, I'm just not the kind of person who can take it on faith). It just means we don't know. The reason religion is so popular isn't because it's undeniably true, it's because it gives people answers. People like answers. Our brain evolved to like answers. So when someone is faced with ""What happens after I die?"" they don't want to hear ""I don't know, you'll just have to wait and see."" It's much more palatable (especially if you're super young) when someone says, ""There's heaven after you die, and that's where good people like you go...all you have to do is believe and follow these rules."" Religion takes takes away the pain of uncertainty and puts an answer in its place. That's what makes it so intoxicating."	TwoXChromosomes	atheism	1

It's literally the core purpose of warmode, why does it need compensation? No such ""compensation"" existed on PvP servers for the last 13 years, why is it suddenly needed now?

Because the carrot and stick changed. Once they made Warmode optional, they needed *something* to introduce new players to PvP (in this case, risk vs reward). Look how much the PvP scene shrank over the years. They didn't want to risk launching Warmode with only the hardest of core players PvPing it out (and it would have been boring seeing such a small group of players like that). Having played almost exclusively on PvP servers, I knew a bunch of people that only played on PvP servers for the chance of finding a bigger guild, but were never interested in PvP because there wasn't much of a reward in world PvP, and in the process never really had the incentive to learn how to PvP (and it got really boring fighting someone who just essentially took the ganking without putting up a fight, simply because they knew you'd eventually get bored).

Do I think the current implementation of Warmode is perfect? No, but at the same time, I appreciate it for what it is. The rewards (10% resources AND the Conquest system included) adds more of a compelling reason to actually stay flagged for PvP, and I know very real examples of people (in my guild especially) who dipped their feet into it this expansion and are now introducing themselves to PvP and are actually learning to fight instead of just staying away from it altogether."

"When my family moved from the first house I lived in to the next, it was a similar situation. We lived in a two bedroom ranch with a basement.

However, these don't apply to China, which has raised nearly a billion people out of absolute poverty in the last few decades, largely independently of these types of programs. 

And yet China's growth is routinely included in reports on poverty reduction. 

There's an excellent scholarly article called [The true extent of global poverty and hunger: questioning the good news narrative of the Millennium Development Goals](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2015.1109439) that breaks down how the MDGs have been subtly shifted since their inception to include more people, or to reduce the necessary threshold for calling someone ""poor"" while making it look like it's actually been raised.

EDIT: From the abstract (emphasis mine):

&gt; The MDGs have used targeted statistical manipulation to make it seem as though the poverty and hunger trends have been improving when in fact they have worsened. In addition, the MDGs use definitions of poverty and hunger that dramatically underestimate the scale likely of these problems. **In reality, around four billion people remain in poverty today, and around two billion remain hungry – more than ever before in history, and between two and four times what the UN would have us believe**. The implications of this reality are profound. Worsening poverty and hunger trends indicate that our present model of development is not working and needs to be fundamentally rethought.

239	"I do appreciate your perspective and I don't know the conditions over there. I can only give my own anecdotes. 

My mom was a high school principal and teacher for 10 years. I can tell you she spent most of the school holidays doing full days at the office, the only difference was she got home a little earlier. During school days she rarely got home before 8pm and was very often still preparing teacher schedules and stuff like that at home. 

Granted part of that was because apparently her deputy principals were useless and she often had to take on a lot of their work. 

My girlfriend is a primary school teacher, she spends most of the holidays finishing marking, because it's not just ticking boxes - students need individual feedback and analysis on how they're doing in various areas. Now multiply that by like 200 students. Also on lesson planning for the next semester because god knows how they're expected to prepare lessons during the school period with everything else going on (remember they have to mark holiday homework when school starts again so they'll have no time). Also finishing paperwork for their department, attending conferences, dealing with parents etc.

&gt;Beyond that, though, companies create virtual monopolies all the time. For even drugs that aren't under patent. Because there's only ever a handful of manufacturers for any given generic.

As to generics, generics only are required to track the active ingredients of their product.  They can (and do) put all sorts of other things into the generic drugs they make.  With the brand name, the number of hours they have had to jump through to make sure it even hits the shelves vastly outnumbers those generics face.

I was so excited because I had been learning to read. I actually managed to read it at 4 &amp; a half-5 years old, just out of pure determination (it was my present, after all, and I was damn well gonna enjoy it!). It sparked a lifelong obsession and now I'm studying to teach literature. As a result, I've followed this LPT with all of my friends' kids. It especially helps if it's an activity thing for the kid, since getting a sibling is often the catalyst for a lot more independent play. The eldest child often gets too much attention from mom &amp; dad to the point where it's suffocating...and then it suddenly drops off when they realize their parenting style is unsustainable. I think that an activity-focused gift is a great way to commemorate the rite of passage into entertaining their own damn selves.

I don't remember feeling entitled to the gift. I remember thinking 'huh, that's weird that I would get a present'. But maybe it helps that it wasn't presented in an appeasing way. It was more of a spontaneous 'here, we saw this and thought you'd like it' gift, which are the best kind of presents. I also don't remember it setting an expectation, because i knew it was a one-off and didn't think I would get stuff on other important occasions.

For people who think this will spoil a child, remember that you can always just get a couple of toys suitable for multiple ages. You don't have to make it explicitly FOR the older kid.

256	"&gt;Google builds a code for a reference device (Googe Nexus series, now Pixel series) and releases the code to open public and other companies make changes to the code based on their hardware and their requirement. Which company achieves a better software optimization? Google or third parties? 

The vast majority of Android code is agnostic of the hardware it's running on. You just make sure your hardware works against the completely open and longstanding API calls Android will make. It's a complete different layer of the stack. Customising for a given piece of hardware is primarily a Linux kernel level change, and the vast majority of the work is actually handled by the SoC vender - usually Qualcomm. The only time a vendor will really need to tweak Android is if they want to support hardware features that android itself doesn't yet support - for example the s pen or essential's notch before android P.

&gt;Plus, Samsung is forced into a position to add features in order to differentiate itself from other ocmpanies, which would inevitably make the system heavier and slower. 

This is just absolute nonsense. They aren't forced to add features at all. The vast majority of Android device makers don't feel the need to add unique features, they just make a well executed device for a great price. Samsung does this entirely by choice.

&gt;So they are not the same code. 

They aren't the same code *because Samsung feels the need to add an enormous amount of shite*. Its not in any way necessary. And to clarify, im not just talking about the user facing duplicate apps, nor even adding features such as the s pen. It's the MASSIVE and incredibly bloated framework in the background that they feel the need to add that really kills performance. They actively try to make their devices as non-standard as possible, adding fuckloads of worthless additional APIs in the hope developers make use of them, thus making the apps in question on work fully or even at all on Samsung devices.

Luckily they've completely failed in encouraging developers to make heavy use of their framework, but they bolt it all on to each phone regardless.

It's also worth noting that a lot of this additional code is flat out badly written. It's fundamentally laggy and bloated code. It takes far more ram than it should and requires far more CPU cycles. They simply are not good at writing software."	I also once read that men are more susceptible to hernias because when the testicles drop down they create weakness in the abdominal wall.

271	The article claims that at least three girls aged ten years have been married to older men as a result of this. That's pretty different from what you describe.	"I think this is a genuinely interesting photograph, quite possibly a historical one. It *does* tell a story. But just like many other famous photograph, the story is a complete fabrication. Looking at the picture, you see a furious man surrounded by a group of disgusted women staring at him. An observer will assume that they're disgusted at him, when in reality, they're his relatives and they're there to *support* him. They're disgusted by the same thing that's making him angry.

Remember how the Times darkened [OJ's arrest photo](http://www.arogundade.com/oj-simpson-murder-trial-case-time-and-newsweek-magazine-cover-controversy-1994-oj-simpson-photo-manipulation.html), making him appear to have a five o'clock shade and giving him a menacing look? That's a pretty clear cut example of a major news source altering a photograph to make it fit better with their narrative.

In the OJ case, the times actually edited the photo in order to create the lie. This case is much more interesting, because the lie was created through careful photo composition by a skilled photographer.

* The photographer needed to take the picture from an angle where he was completely surrounded by women. Note how most of the men in the picture are blocked by the heads of the women, making it appear like almost everyone in his vicinity are female.
* Obviously, the photographer needed to catch a moment where Kavanaugh was railing and screaming. Based on videos of this hearing, it seems that was not hard to do. This is a bit of an own goal when it comes to controlling the media narrative.
* To further tell *his* story, the photographer needed to take a snapshot at a moment when the women where looking furious at the same time as they're looking at Kavanaugh. I'm guessing the photographer sifted through thousands of shot shots to find this moment.
* One subtle detail that I think a lot of people miss is that except for Kavanaugh, the men pictured here have a very neutral expression. This furthers the impression that Kavanaugh is saying something deeply offensive to women, but once again, it's actually just a carefully chosen photograph. I really believe that this is one of the most important reasons why this picture is so powerful.

My conclusion is that it's pretty obvious the Kavanaugh was trying to control the media narrative by placing his own female relatives around him during this hearing. His attempt backfired miserably as this photographer managed to twist the narrative into the exact opposite through some truly impressive skill.

If a child feels threatened, or does not want to be present in an institution that promotes and protects this activity, or suffer from the psychological abuse and damage that would most likely occur, then yes, getting CPS is a ligitimate action to take. Would it be inconvenient for the family, yes, but so would being raped or abused, or the tens of thousands of dollars of counseling, or the loss of an otherwise bright future. I have former friends who are still suffering from the effects far into adulthood from their parents putting their faith in God before the well being of their children, one of which attempted to take his own life and ruin his future that came from a model Catholic family in our own neighborhood whom I grew up with. Parents are people just like you and me, and they are falable and make bad decisions, even about the well being of their kids, and especially when the pressure of “Heaven and Hell” come from all angles at their chosen social network (the church). However, from OP’s response, it looks as if the parents are choosing their children’s well being over the demands of these old school Catholics, which gives us all hope that this family will heal and move forward together, with each member making their own decision to worship or participate, or not to participate as they please.

""Glass"" is a huge field of materials science, and it turns out that you can make glass that is both more durable and less slippery than asphalt. A successful solar roadway is one that wouldn't need to be maintained as frequently as normal roadways, thus saving maintenance (and hopefully money).

Also, how often do you see roads covered with an opaque layer of dirt? Most roads are exposed to the sun most of the time. Even if they are dusty or grimy, the idea of solar roadways is that because they are such an economy of scale, reduced efficiency isn't that much of a detriment. Think of the articles on solar windows that pop up every now and then. It doesn't matter that they'd produce 10% the electricity of a dedicated solar panel, because if every equator-facing window of every skyscraper was producing *some* electricity, it'd be huge.

&gt; Plus roads are often shaded by vehicles and buildings. Plus to clean/replace them you have to close the road.

Some of the early research into solar roadways showed that even during bumper to bumper traffic, the amount of time a road surface is shielded from the sun is only like 50%. And that kind of traffic only occurs during a short part of the day.

&gt;Seriously can anybody explain why you wouldn't just put the panels somewhere better?

Solar roads bring up a bunch of interesting side benefits. In moderately cold areas, they can have heating elements which produce enough heat to prevent build up. Solar roads are also usually proposed as being covered in LEDs. When severe tile damage occurs (think pothole), they could highlight it. Traffic lines could be literally illuminated at night, improving safety. Since they're networked, the entire road system could be used to deliver road closure or detour messages. Since they're all interconnected and powered, they could also be designed to replace long runs of low-voltage overhead powerlines and telecommunication lines.

Problem is, they're a totally new concept that has state-of-the-art engineering challenges in materials science, electric microgrid research, and at the end of the day, cost. Nevertheless, I think the concept is sufficiently grounded in current technology to warrant research.

338	"It seems to me that in most contexts 'free will' is defined as 'the quality which a person must have in order to be ultimately responsible for their decision making', but the actual mechanism of that quality is left un-scrutinised as a mysterious 'black box'.  

  There's a frustrating exchange that I've seen recur between incompatibilists and compatibilists, where the compatibilist will point out that the incompatibilist's definition of free will is incoherent and therefore must be false. To which the incompatibilist replies 'of course it's incoherent, that's exactly why I don't believe in it!' I think the compatibilist makes the mistake that 'free will' must have *some* kind of coherent definition, or else people wouldn't use the term. I think in actual fact people use the term 'free will' for this black box (because it's expedient for assigning moral responsibility onto others) without knowing or thinking too much about what exactly goes on inside it.  

  I'm an incompatibilist because I really fail to see what could possibly be in the box that provides the qualities that define free will, that would make an individual in some fundamental way the ultimate source of their actions."

You love guns and video games, and your love of graphics cards suggests maybe IT but everything else you write says no. You’re likely upper lower class or lower middle class. You make enough to get by but it’s a struggle. You have a wife, so you’re not incel or too far gone, but you feel attacked by identity politics and would never have voted for a woman candidate. You are deeply enough embedded in gun and conspiracy culture that you have disdain for the police and government, think their intrusions are a big problem and if not directly targeting you, you’ve seen enough run ins that you don’t like what you see. When youre mad, your rhetoric gets very dangerous- you advocated shooting police officers families. My guess is you’re a Trump supporter from a rust belt state- Michigan / PA / Wisconsin. Late 20s to early 30s. Slightly younger than me but not ba much. I would assume you CC if it’s legal. I read your last page or two of posts to see if my instincts were right. Your word choice / diction, and often flawed logical constructions make me know you didn’t go to an ivy, don’t have a post graduate degree, and don’t have a trust fund to sit on.

I don’t understand on your focus on attacking men. I don’t think men are under attack because of the shootings. I think guns are under attack because of the shootings. I don’t view or associate manliness with guns.

Manliness is about personal character and approach to the world. A gun is a tool for force projection. A man projects his own force through his presence, statements, and actions. Associating a gun with a man is alien to me.

You tend not to react to what people say but to what you perceive they said as it correlates to a talking point. Above you get into pull yourself up by your bootstraps as a talking point, but I don’t believe in that and did not suggest that. That’s nonsense and not possible.

You also questioned the Russian attack on our elections as propaganda by people with a motive. You denied these as facts several months ago. The problem is they were fact then, and now with Muellers indictment we know even more about what happened. That a campaign like that wouldn’t flip 40,000 votes in the three states that mattered is untenable. Either Facebook and Google advertising is worthless, or the Russians flipped the election. And this is without further results about other parts of the investigation. We know CozyBear and FanfyBear are Russian operations, but you probably don’t believe that either.

What this all gets to is that I’m not unsympathetic to your underlying complaint.

I don’t think it’s all that surprising that disaffected young males with no real future, no real opportunity, and no societal support network lash out. It’s not even all that “crazy” from how we use those words traditionally. It’s not like they’ve lost contact with reality and rationality. It’s that they exist in a society which doesn’t care about them and they uestion the moral imperative to care about everyone else. This is sadly rational.

But the problem is society caring more isn’t a fix. The jobs aren’t coming back. Everything Trymp has promised is a lie. Unless we stop automation vast swaths of this country will be unemployed. We hadn’t had a major war in 70 years so you have all these extra people who would have died or found social advancement on the battle field.

Now you need education, connections, or money. And if you don’t have those there isn’t a way up. Period.

But the narrative hasn’t changed- everyone is still told to West young man. Write a new app. Code something. Do x do y. But there’s no real opportunity and if I didn’t have a great brain, live in NYC, get the best private education in the US, followed by an ivy, I might be in the same position as so many young men throughout this country who simply don’t know what to do.

Automation makes that worse. Human labor is worthless now. You are competing against a machine that doesn’t get sick or tired or need money to support a family. There’s no competitikn.

We can solve some poverty and starvation through a minimum basic income, but that doesn’t solve a mans need for a purpose.

Most people don’t want government money, they want a job they can go to, come home and put food on the table, and watch TV with the wife and go to poker night on thursdays and have a bbq on the weekend.

But that’s not the world anymore. And I don’t want to change where the world is going. My priority is getting us off this rock and figuring out how to make us immortal.

So the solution is to take all the guns, so we raise the barrier of entry above what is realistic for your average school shooter, so that by the time they have the means to carry something out and are working the underground networks, we know who they are and they trip so many red flags we stop them.

White men have to deal with the fact that we have to compete with women and minorities and the rest of the world for jobs and money and success.

That is not an attack on masculinity, it’s a redefinition of ethics. And viewing it as an attack on masculinity is problematic. Because white males have fucked everyone else over for so long that when you bring this up you look ridiculous. The issue is really that it’s rich white makes that got all the winnings, and social media now gives everyone a voice and poor white males are combined in the readjustment against rich white males.

The complaint isn’t necessarily invalid, but it’s very hard to make from a selling your message stand point. And given how unequal the world is and how bad the upper class is; no one cares right now.

To your other points- we do know the regulation would work. It’s worked everywhere else in the world. There is information to comb through, you haven’t looked.

We don’t remove certain people who fall of the tables right to own firearms, we recognize that none of us ever had this right. We take all the guns. And if people like you who like them want to negotiate rather than being intransigent, we could do something like: legislation that limits muzzle velocity / round kinetic energy, cycle rate, effective lethal range. We can have increased penalties and higher mandatory minimums for violations. And we can register, track, and tag all ammunition. This is in addition to obvious restrictions like background checks, doctor evaluations for anyone with mental health issues, and bans for felons and anyone on watch lists.

That’s my middle ground. But until your side wants to discuss that middle ground and no just background checks I’m going to advocate a ban, not incrementalism.

This is a massive wall of text. But you responded in more depth so I thought it’s worth having the conversation with you.

If you find value in firearms, great, I’m glad you have a hobby and a passion. But I want you to understand what it represents to the rest of us and that we live in a society where we’ve all agreed more or less to some terms. And one of those terms is that enough of us agree the rules can change.

I don’t think we ever had the right to privately own guns let alone AR-15s. I think we didn’t want to fund a standing army so there was a good idea of doing it like the Swiss.

I also think we fought a civil war which invalidated a lot of this shit, and we now have a standing army not militias.

I think the placement of a comma matters, and that Arms with a capital was used to refer to Coats of Arms as signaling devices on the battlefield, which are necessary to a well regulated militia. It’s about coordination.

And merchants who aren’t nobles weren’t allowed to bear coats of arms. Meaning if a noble tried to atrack their shit, they couldn’t defend without breaking the law.

This may sound stupid. But you go before the king after and x noble says you were flying your flag and coordinating your guys so we lost when we tried to collect a transit tax, and the King says is this true? And then you lose everything or die.

Are guns fun? Sure.

But there’s no reason the government can’t know every single thing about every round fired in this country.

Is it a risk if someone wants to round up all the gun owners and put them in gulags? Sure?

But if someone wants to kill every gun owner in America, do you really think they need a list? Or that a list will substantively help them?"	technology	business	1

353	This is one reason why USENET has its good sides despite being very old technologically, since the way it works is that every newsgroup offered by USENET servers is replicated on those servers in its entirety (although message retention times can vary). Plus honouring message deletion messages is voluntary so not nearly every server will do it, meaning that if you posted something in a reasonably popular newsgroup, it will potentially end up being replicated on dozens (or hundreds in the past) of fully independent servers all over the world with no way of deleting or altering it on all of those afterward - which is how currently Google has fairly large USENET archive going back all the way to 1985 or so, since only one of those servers would need to have a working backup of a newsgroup to save it.	"Yes, in my opinion the way it has to go is that insurance is attached to the vehicle itself (like it already is in many countries, for example where I live it has always been that way) and accidents are by default no-fault unless there's proof of some kind of gross negligence/interference or malfunction etc.

374	"What are the true positive rate and precision? If you have 10,000 people, of which 1000 people are negative, with a false positive rate of 98%, you end up with 980 negative people turning up positive. But if the true positive rate is 99% (because hey, it's very trigger happy), you'll end up with 99% of 9000 people (8910 people) who are positive identified and identified as positive. This gives you a precision of 90% or so. That means, if you get flagged as positive, you have a 10% chance of being innocent.

If there are 100 people who are negative, the precision increases to almost 99% (1% chance of being innocent, compared to 0.02% if the FPR were 2% instead.) That's better than you can get with evidence in most simple cases. It's still huge, but the background rate (the prior) modulates it.

The problem is, the majority of people are usually innocent. Out of 10,000 people, let's be generous and say 1000 (a full 10%) are criminals. 990 of these 1000 are identified by the system, along with 8820 innocents. Now, if you're flagged, you're 90-ish% likely to be innocent. If 50/10,000 are criminals, 9751 innocents get flagged, and it'll probably (99.5%) be an innocent."	"Most recently:

Increasingly you have to rely on tribal knowledge and whatever you can puzzle out of WWDC slide decks rather than the actual docs. Sometimes it's an issue of sparsity, sometimes it's an issue of basic things being omitted or presented at such a high level that you have to experiment to figure out basic issues, other times the docs are wrong. 

Case in point: the CoreAudio docs were never amazing, but they were adequate if not always up to date. I'm having a really tough time figuring out some fundamental things about AVAudioEngine. Which is a shame, because it is a really great framework if you can get it to do what you want it to do. (Anyone realize there's now a supported minimum phase resampling algorithm?

And there's absolutely zero out there on what its performance characteristics are (stopband attenuation, etc.), so developers without the background on assessing filter design/performance are probably never going to select it.)"	"&gt;A low dollar is usually considered good for natural resource exporters. Your workers are paid using the cheaper currency, while your buyers get more bang for their buck making your product look like a comparatively good deal.

The low dollar helps manufacturing and exports to some extent, but it's a temporary bandaid that may hurt long-term development more than it helps. Technology purchased from the US and overseas becomes more expensive, so companies have less ability to invest in modernizing their production line. It also becomes increasingly difficult to retain mobile high tech talent because the low dollar magnifies the salary differential, which makes establishing, growing, and retaining companies in the ""new economy"" that everyone talks about wanting to build more difficult. 

And if the dollar dips below historical lows (which it may well, given the significant drop in FDI over the last three years and the increasing sense that Canada is a place where capital investment goes to die), it's inevitable that our standard of living will drop as costs for imported things like pharmaceuticals and medical equipment become more expensive. (A lot of us are starting to feel this on a micro level; I have some personal projects on the side that could eventually be profitable, but as costs rise, whether it's even worth it becomes harder to justify to my wife.) Resources industries may increasingly be seen as undesirable to many, but they do help to support the way of life we've become accustomed to, and provide the financial resources to diversify into new areas. They also provide jobs for segments of the population that may not be wholesale retrainable for high tech jobs, even if there was the volume of jobs to accommodate them."	technology	canada	1

The share of the national debt held by Social Security's main trust fund is expected to fall as that government agency cashes out its holdings to pay promised levels of Social Security benefits, where its account is expected to be fully depleted in just 17 years.

Having inner morality and determining it's better then all oaths anywhere is folly. What if Davos believed starving out King's Landing was more 'right' then storming it? Is he now suddenly justified? What if Davos feels that he should bed Selyse because the Baratheons are obviously impotent and he feels this is 'right'.

Inner morality doesn't work and it's inherently selfish. Knights aren't selfish at all, they serve their liege.

&gt;Suppose you have 30,000 dollars in loans. 20k in a 10% loan, and 10k in a 3% loan.

&gt;You could pay back 10k in the next 2 years, but if you choose the 3% loan, you will spend an additional $1,400 on this mistake.

The claim is that Dave Ramsey is wrong because of the above. This is not correct. 

Certainly they are correct in their calculations, the claim that you save more money by paying the highest interest rate isn't in contest, but they are completely wrong in concluding that this means that you ought to pay the highest interest loans off first.

My claim is essentially that if you give financial advice without considering who that person is, you aren't correct in your advice. I will grant that there are certain pieces of general advice that you can give without knowing much or anything about the person, but debt repayment is a topic where the personal factors matter a lot.

Again, I'm only really addressing what the OP said. I'm not substituting in arguments that they didn't make.

Honestly even if it isn't true, I wouldn't really focus on it. What she is communicating is that she doesn't feel confident and is fearing failure. If you are certain that she wants to lose weight and you want to help her.

There’s always a race to “be first,” and TV is the worst offender. I can’t classify internet news as news, particularly if they’re not on the scene and not talking to cops and officials involved. 

There are plenty of places labeling themselves “news” that are nothing but sheer make believe (the original “fake news” out of Macedonia) or propaganda. Looking at you, Faux News. "	"You’re right.

409	"As an addendum to all of this, if you really are trying to control your drift/position in the ocean, you can always drop a [sea anchor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_anchor)

Think of it like a parachute that catches the water around you. If you try to go anywhere, the parachute fills with water and drastically increases your drag.

Fun fact, in the days of big sailing ships, if they had no wind available they would do [""warping"" or ""kedging"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warping_(sailing\)) What you'd do is load up your sea anchor in some longboats, have the men paddle it in the direction you wanted to go, push it overboard and let it 'inflate'. Then, much like in winching a car, you had another group of longboats go to the midway point on the line, attach another line at that spot, and then they would paddle perpendicularly to the direction of the line. The result is that the force of your paddling was multiplied through the 'lever arm' of the sea anchor's line, and you could pull your huge ship forward some distance.

I can't recall the specific battle, but there was an incident once where an American warship was fighting a European one (uncertain if British or French or someone else, been a while) near Africa if I recall. The American ship wanted to disengage, but at some point in the battle the wind died down to nothing. The American captain, quick thinking, immediately had his men deploy for kedging. After a few minutes of this the enemy captain quickly followed suit. The result was that two modern warships were being towed VEEEERRYYYY SLOWWWWWLYYYY through battle with each other over the course of like 6-8 hours. I seem to recall that the ships were JUST close enough for the bow/stern guns to bother shooting at each other, but I could be wrong on that point.

The end result was after all this time the enemy captain said ""Screw this, I don't want him THAT much."" and disengaged.

Found the engagement: [USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution_vs_HMS_Guerriere)"	"Have you seen the video of the incident? I guarantee that I personally wouldn't have been able to avoid that accident if I was driving.

But I think what gets lost is that this is truly stuff taught to a Black Male in middling to low end financial situations as a child. Everything that Harvey said, can be repeated verbatim by just about every Chicago male that I know. In fact, this isn't about Harvey really being wrong, it's about how he doesn't conform to modern day's ubiquitous view that everyone is equal and should be treated the same. When presented with a famous black male's point of view that doesn't confirm this viewpoint, he gets ostracized. Which is bullshit. Honestly it is. We are forcefed bullshit agendas by the media and now it is so much a part of us, that you can't be different the other direction (I don't know how to underline but that last part is important). But it goes to show that when growing up in the right place, it doesn't matter what the country teaches, you will believe what your mother has taught you and what your father has beats into you.

411	"&gt; Things that might otherwise stigmatize and isolate people have become points of connection online.

Right, but who is to say every point of connection is a positive influence? There's a reason this post contained the disclaimer:

&gt;WARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide

Pre-2000s maybe we looked around and thought, *everyone around me seems less down than I am in general, I should figure out what is going on and try to work out of this funk...*


But then you got on 4chan the first time and discovered that there's an epidemic. Now maybe there's less motivation to work on the issues leading to ideation/depression because previously they seemed like barriers to connection but in a digital setting everything no matter how grim or bad is a means of connecting with others. 


If you feel isolated, maybe the internet is an enabler. Maybe someone who is depressed and seeking human connection cannot bring themselves to work on the one thing that allows them to keep connecting with others (so they think), suicidal depression. So instead of thinking of it as an illness, it becomes an identity.


That is the premise of my question, maybe using technology to connect humanity absolutely to whatever end is not a good thing. Maybe we need to become aware that just because you are one way and can find others that are the same way, does not make it healthy to be hate posting over at /r/The_Donald or /b/ while loathing in suicidal depression. That's all technically what you are describing, connecting with others, but without the things that traditionally govern healthy interaction such as social normative behavior, cultural values, empathy etc. all of that gets removed online and re-created via systems like Reddit's mod/karma system, but its far from human...

I am going to argue fervently that in the general case of connected technology the end did not justify the means. For every positive interaction via the internet there are a dozen that are purely cancerous. And I think the socio-political climate in America repute with hate speech, racist political leadership, fake news etc. is the case study, enabled at least in part, by facilitating and empowering the wrong types of connections. Another case in point is the flat earth/anti-vax movements. Those are only possible via connected technology that allow disparate collections of mental illness to self-validate and organize.

No really, go youtube some conservative leader's thoughts on modesty, or women's strength and they will all say this shit, trying to say to they respect women immensely, which is why they can't respect women.
WOMEN ARE PRECIOUS AND SACRED....So we can't have them making big decisions for themselves. And we need to tell them to cover up. To protect them from our gaze, of course.
WOMEN ARE KIND AND LOVING....So we need them to be at home. no matter what they want, to raised our spawn.
MEN HAVE RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY....But women have authority in their houses...so...it's fair.... right?

"Tbh, and I hope you think about this carefully: if you were a pharmaceutical company CEO, would you develop drugs that didn't have IP protection? Keep in mind you have to compensate the cost of dozens of drugs that didn't make it through phase 3 clinical trials to market.

There's a reason drug costs are high in the US, I believe it lies closer towards our payer system than our IP system. There's also nothing to say the government shouldn't more aggressively subsidize drugs for key diseases or take particular action in the case of rare diseases or cases in which a cure is truly exclusive for a life-threatening illness. Our payer system offers little negotiating advantage in these key scenarios; a life-saving cure might get FDA fast track approval but doesn't necessarily reach patients at a cheaper cost.

But to say that the US pharma industry isn't the peak of pharmaceutical development in the world is laughable. The facts suggest that our current system puts out the most possible new drugs in the least time. The questions: is this truly worth it to the consumer if they are bankrupted for a slightly more up-to-date cure? How can we protect vulnerable patient groups with life-threatening illnesses with few available options? Are there means to distribute costs efficiently such that failed clinical trials do not force exorbitantly high costs down the road?

Anyone who thinks this solution is simple, that we can preserve the rate of pharmaceutical discovery while easily keeping patient costs in control is sadly mistaken. Such a balance would require a huge overhaul of our health care system and a definitive investment of our budget. (Neither of which I am opposed to.)"	technology	worldnews	1

What makes you think this is any more concrete proof that it's easier to go masters-&gt;GM vs being harder to go diamond-&gt;masters?

Either one of those scenarios would result in the same statistical anomaly of a smaller % in masters compared to % in GM

The people struggling to hold onto low masters are nothing close to the people pushing towards GM, and a difference in the difficulty for those low masters/diamond players would skew this statistic exactly the same as the high masters/GM players. Actually even moreso, since there are more low masters players than borderline GM players

If you buffed terran right now in a way that made it easier to play for Diamond players, but had no impact on GM players, then you would see a bunch of terran diamonds jump into low masters. But no Terrans would be jumping from masters to GM. This would increase the % in masters and lower the relative % in GM compared to masters, even though it has nothing to do with GM level balance.

444	"That's what I feel when I see videos of any ARPG in Youtube, including PoE. It's just the nature of the genre.

What I like about D3 is pushing my GR (Greater Rift) limits, it is where the challenge is. I don't care about taking a top spot on the LBs since I can't play much (I never get past paragon 800-850 in a season), but I still like pushing for higher GR levels and manage to get a spot around 700 or so.

Greater Rifts are randomised dungeons with infinitely increasing difficulty levels that you have to complete within 15mins to advance. Every consecutive death has an increased death timer so playing too recklessly is not an option, since it costs you a lot of time. Playing too carefully is not an option either, becuase you will never complete it in time.

This is were the skill comes in... learning to herd big mob packs, what elite affixes you have to skip, stutter stepping, timing your burst with other buffs (like the Convention of Elements buff) etc.

At the end of the day D3 is a simple game aimed at more casual players, players who don't want to deal with the daunting skill tree of PoE, who can get to the endgame fast, who don't want to trade or farm for too long to make a decent build and who can swap builds easily without having to reroll a new character. Imo D3 has a smoother gameplay, but the basic principles of gameplay in both games is the same: kill stuff--&gt; get loot/exp --&gt; kill stronger stuff --&gt;get better loot/exp etc etc.

There is no reason to convince you to play though... you either play and you enjoy it or you don't. I don't know where you are from and how expensive the game is for you so I cannot advice you for or against a refund.

447	"&gt; I hear a lot about fusion and ""new-generation"" fission reactors being potentially revolutionary in the way we generate electricity. However, it is my understanding that it will be a new way to generate heat, while we will still use old-school steam turbines to convert heat into electricity. My question is, are there any theoretical or ""moonshot"" ideas of a more efficient way to generate electricity

There is a certain type of fusion called [aneutronic fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion) in which no neutrons are produced by the fusion reaction and the energy is carried away by alpha particles. The most desirable of the possible reactions is the [proton + ^(11)Boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion#Proton-boron) reaction because of the availability of fuel:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One method of producing proton-boron fusion uses one laser to create a boron-11 plasma and another to create a stream of protons that smash into the plasma. The laser-generated proton beam produces a tenfold increase of boron fusion because protons and boron nuclei collide directly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This method releases energy directly as electricity without requiring conversion from heat. 

This conversion of the kinetic energy of alpha particles directly into electricity (without the use of a heat engine) is called [direct energy conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_energy_conversion). 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Experiments suggest a petawatt-scale laser pulse producing a quadwatt of power could launch an ‘avalanche’ fusion reaction.

There is a paper about this:

[Road map to clean energy using laser beam ignition of boron-hydrogen fusion](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/laser-and-particle-beams/article/road-map-to-clean-energy-using-laser-beam-ignition-of-boronhydrogen-fusion/8BE057DC1BC9E0A588FB3ABAA993078C).

Also a more readable announcement from the University of New South Wales  (UNSW): 

[Laser-boron fusion now ‘leading contender’ for energy](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/laser-boron-fusion-now-%E2%80%98leading-contender%E2%80%99-energy).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A laser-driven technique for creating fusion that dispenses with the need for radioactive fuel elements and leaves no toxic radioactive waste is now within reach, say researchers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dramatic advances in powerful, high-intensity lasers are making it viable for scientists to pursue what was once thought impossible: creating fusion energy based on hydrogen-boron reactions. And an Australian physicist is in the lead, armed with a patented design and working with international collaborators on the remaining scientific challenges.

...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather than heat fuel to the temperature of the Sun using massive, high-strength magnets to control superhot plasmas inside a doughnut-shaped toroidal chamber (as in NIF and ITER), hydrogen-boron fusion is achieved using two powerful lasers in rapid bursts, which apply precise non-linear forces to compress the nuclei together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hydrogen-boron fusion produces no neutrons and, therefore, no radioactivity in its primary reaction. And unlike most other sources of power production – like coal, gas and nuclear, which rely on heating liquids like water to drive turbines – the energy generated by hydrogen-boron fusion converts directly into electricity.

It seems to me that this qualifies as both a *""potentially revolutionary in the way we generate electricity""* and *""moonshot idea""* at the same time.

Having said that this is a serious and feasible proposal from actual fusion physicists. It may become feasible in the near future if the anticipated development of multi-petawatt lasers does happen:

See: [Ultraintense 100 petawatt laser aims to uncover the secret of vacuum](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2017/09/ultraintense-100-petawatt-laser-aims-to-uncover-the-secret-of-vacuum.html)."

All the speculations at the end are pure FUD:

- We don't know if there will be any regulation, but I'd say it's unlikely because hubs/relays never have control over the funds or knowledge about where a payment is coming from or going to. Also, Bitcoin doesn't have any borders, so you can always use a hub in a country without  regulation.
* We don't even know if hubs will be a thing at all, because they'd need to put large amounts of money into online hot-wallets, and that gets riskier the bigger they are.
* You don't need large channels if you make sure your channels balance out by routing tx in both directions.
* It's an open ecosystem, so anybody who charges unreasonable fees will be pushed out of the market.
* There can be multiple logical and interconnected networks with different topologies (hub-and-spoke, mesh, whatever) on the same LN. Wallets (you!) decide where to connect to and who to route through, so you are free to use or not use hubs, should they emerge.
* A 3rd party monitoring a channel for you knows nothing about that channel other than some keys that can be used to punish a bad actor, but for nothing else.

is a good example of how a neural network will mistake a bird for a bike.

You have to separate how YOU distinguish a bird from a bike and how a neural network does it.

The pattern in that link looks NOTHING like a toaster, however it has signals that would essentially trigger all the pathways in a neural network model that would make the computer strongly associate it with a toaster regardless of what else is in the scene.

Similar with birds and bikes. You don't need a bird that looks kinda like a bike, or a bike that kinda looks like a bird. You just need something that has some sort of signal that strongly implies something else to the neural network. 

When we train a neural network, we don't have a very clear image into what's going on in the model. It's all just math.

Save for those that get sucked into the Hollywood machine like Stephen King, GRRM, JK Rowling, etc. Because of the popularity of the works derived from their novels, they reach super star levels of notoriety themselves. However, wildly successful authors who have plenty of big bestsellers and are very successful can walk around and interact with the general public daily and not really worry about being recognized or mobbed by fans on a regular basis.

501	"It's a funny thing that almost everyone who says it can't be a diablo MMO always starts with ""although I would love a diablo mmo.."". 

I personally think that there is a huge market for Diablo 3 and a great opportunity for Blizz to merge the gameplay elements of two amazing games. 

Furthermore, you can speak of market saturation but the market is shrinking in part because very few new quality titles have been offered in the last couple of years in the MMO space. WoW is a cash cow right now for Blizzard, but a company that leans on it's cash cow is a company in decline. To stay in marketing speak, Blizzard needs a Star. 

The argument that it would split its base also doesn't hold up. WoW subscriptions have been declining for years, Blizzard shouldn't be worried about splitting their base, they should be worried about losing customers and clearly no WoW expansion can't truly fix the decline in the long term. 

My bold prediction is World of Diablo as MMO that will instantly rekindle the whole mmo genre and create a hype unlike we have ever seen, while the WoW series will slowly but surely go to free to play status (or perhaps free to play only for World of Diablo subscribers).

Even so, nearly every day from about 5:00 to 7:00 there is a peak of use of the more expensive gas when the sun goes down. Because gas is considerably more expensive the spot price for electricity peaks somewhat during this period compared to the price in the middle of the day.

There is a great opportunity here to make some money for any plant that can store a decent amount of energy in the middle of the day and return it to the grid for two hours starting at about 5:00 pm."	"&gt; there used to be (wrong) theories that didn't invoke genetical change over generations

Not so. A proposed explanation for a phenomenon (such as the phenomenon of genetic change over many generations) is called an [hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis). In order to merit being called a [scientific theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory) a hypothesis must first survive a great deal of repeated testing. Historical hypotheses other than natural selection, such as [Lamarkism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism), did not survive testing, so it was only ever an hypothesis, never a theory.

&gt; Well, you say that, but one might think that the change of genetics you say is simply ""evolution"" could be a part of the ""theory of evolution""

Perhaps another example might help you. Gravity is the phenomenon which we observe whenever we hold an object above the ground and then let it go the object falls to the ground. The theory of gravity (which is an explanation of how gravity works) is called ""the [general theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity)"".

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; General relativity, also known as the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.

It should be clear to you that ""gravity"" and ""the general theory of relativity"" are not the same thing.

It's possible these toys are old, and she doesn't use them often -- or at all, but didn't want to throw them out for fear of having to replace them again later. Also, please do not be intimidated by the size of the toy.

It's also common to buy longer toys for the ""handle"" at the end), and even if it is wider than you, I mean, toys and sex feel *so* different. When you have sex, your not just putting your penis in her vagina, right? You're doing other things -- kissing, rubbing, touching, talking, breathing, grinding, moaning, looking... There's so much more to it. Both partners get way more turned on, ESPECIALLY women, who tend to be very emotionally sexual; for many women, sex is more about making love than fucking. Toys can't make love; they can't tell her how sexy it is when she squeezes that muscle or grinds a certain way; they can't cuddle her afterward, and they certainly can't get her a hot washcloth to clean up with so she doesn't have to get off the bed between sex and pillow talk. As a woman who not only owns close to a hundred different toys and had worked at a sex store for over 3 years, I can tell you that if you're doing it right, toys are NO competition. And if you're not doing it right, you can change that. Part of that change might be to incorporate some of these toys into your sex life; view them as *tools*, not as replacements. Sure, you could build a house with a box of screws and a manual screwdriver... But wouldn't the job get done *better* and *more efficiently* with an electric drill? Wouldn't you be able to build a whole neighborhood in the same time it previously took to build one house -- and not have to deal with the hand fatigue on top of that??

The British claimed the area of Palestine following their defeat of the Ottoman Empire in WW1.  In 1948, they abandoned it and a civil war broke out between the Jews and the Arabs living there.   Egypt came to the aid of the Arabs and captured the Gaza Strip.  In 1967, Israel captured the Gaza Strip from Egypt and occupied it offering to trade it back in peace negotiations.  Egypt refused negotiations and Israel built  couple settlements there.  In 1979, they did negotiate a peace treaty but Egypt abandoned its claim to the territory, leaving the inhabitants stateless and occupied by Israel.  In 2005, Israel abandoned its settlements in the Gaza Strip and completely removed their army and turned it over to the Palestinian government.  In 2006, Hamas, a terrorist organization with a political arm, violently took control of the Strip from the opposing Palestinian faction.   In response, Israel blockaded  all but humanitarian items from entering the strip; this blockade has been eased over the years to only include items with military use.  Two or three wars have broken out when Hamas fires hundred of missiles at Israeli towns.  Many Gaza Strip civilians are killed when Israel responds until they get an agreement from Hamas to stop firing missiles.  It’s been four years since the last war, there have been some missiles but not many.  Israel and the world has offered enormous aid and infrastructure if Hamas agrees to disarm, abandon their declared war and turn power back over to the recognized Palestinian government but they refuse.

This week, the Hamas leadership has encouraged thousands of people to demonstrate at the border and demand to be let into Israel.   Most demonstrators are a distance from the actual border fence but many, usually young men, keep approaching the fence to sling rocks, Molotov cocktails, and burning tires at the soldiers on the other side.  These are met with rubber bullets from the soldiers.  If they get too close to crossing the border or damage the fence, they are likely met with real bullets.  Israel is acting probably with a lot more restraint than any other country would.  Imagine a country that has declared war on you sending thousands of their civilians to try and cross the border, they are doing so with the sole goal of trying to get their Palestinian citizens killed. Mission accomplished."	WTF	news	1

And here I do not refer to the Unitarians; for it is to be feared that if these persons have gone out of their way to separate themselves from the other sects on the ground of a doctrine so little taught in our Church, and so little believed in, as that of the Trinity, they must be a pettifogging, cantankerous set of fellows, that prize their own opinions too highly, to become parties to our policy of reunion.

The purchases that ended up saving me lots of money in the long run are as follows: 

1) Older generation iPad. My local library has a free e-book lending program and I saved tons of money on a subscription program or just purchasing e-books. This was particularly useful since I could not get to a library during a time they were open to rent physical books and their e-book collection is much broader/more current.

2) Grocery delivery service. This might seem counterintuitive, but based on my shopping habits, it actually worked out better for me to have an electronic site to log what I wanted to buy in than to go to a store.

3) Wine club. A local winery has an amazing selection of frankly quite pricey wines.

3) I believe Beijing only permits a 48 hour  visa. There are only two cities that allow 144 hours.

4) Did they tell you they ran your details to determine your eligibility for the visa? They are required to do so at check in, but can do it ahead of time. From what I’ve heard, if they did and it said you don’t qualify, there is no chance that will change.

While Siri can do certain things in a HomeKit context, its primary purpose in the HomePod is, as Phil Schiller said at WWDC, to be a ""musicologist"" - in other words: A voice interface for playing music, rather than having to pull your phone out to select tracks/playlists or albums.

The additional functionality that follows with Siri is (in my view, at least) mostly a side effect of not shipping radically different versions of Siri on different devices.

Not having Siri on the HomePod would mean that it would need to have a physical interface more designed for the task, with a display, and you would be forced to either connect it to a third-party device or physically interact  with the speaker."	offbeat	apple	1

In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place.

Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The Senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.

That has to come from her doctor. The doctor does refer to a checklist of things, but look, these are symptoms of a disorder.

I had seizures in junior high, and after a brain scan, determined that while I didn't have epilepsy (they called it ideopathic epilepsy), I could be treated with medication as if I did. I never had another seizure after completing the two-year battery of meds. Unfortunately, ADHD has no such scan to look deeper into the brain to point at and say, yep, there's the ADHD.

654	"I use jQuery still, and I work for a lot of really big clients. I think the main appeal with jQuery is firstly the ecosystem - it's been around so long that there's an answer for how to do anything imaginable. There are also probably more plugins for jQuery than there are apps for iOS, so ""there's a plugin for that"" is a big one.

Secondly, it's super mature and stable. It's as reliable as you can get, and it's also pretty lightweight.

Third, a lot of front-end CSS frameworks use it already, such as Materialize.css and Bootstrap, as well as major platforms like Wordpress. It's just already in or required by so many things.

Those are the big points. Anyone who says ""nobody uses jQuery anymore"" is being an elitist hipster. That's not to say there aren't better frameworks, or the others don't have their place. I LOVE React and Vue and wish I could use them at work sometimes. But, they don't really fit into every scenario (or many scenarios in my situation at work), and it depends on what you're doing on a project.

I'm definitely not crowning jQuery the king, it's just that it's the right tool for the job in more of the most common situations that I'm in daily. Choosing the right tools for the job at hand is half of the development battle, and I don't do my personal projects the same way I do my work projects because they're completely different situations and types of projects.

I give them props for just dropping it immediately after the game. It was a nice surprise. But I thought the movie was pretty disappointing. Plotwise it was messy. Characters were thin and the dialogue was cringeworthy at times. Most of the action and scares felt derivative. The score was complete shit. Some pieces sounded like they belonged in different movies. The tonal shifts were jarring. The cutaways to her husband on Earth were a huge drag. Like c'mon, get back to the action ffs. All the action at the end was contrived. I like the basic idea they were going for, and how it tied into the Cloverfield universe. But the execution was just disappointing. That final shot was so poorly done. It felt really tacked on.  

Props to Netflix for salvaging this rather disappointing movie. Pretty brilliant on their part.  

Edit - The only thing I liked about the scenes with Michael is that they somewhat tied into the 2nd movie. I still think those scenes could have had more stakes and urgency.

660	"I've played the mod since, I was just initially introduced to DayZ via the standalone, and while I've played the Taviana map it was in I think A3 exile or wasteland or breaking point or something and not any separate game/mod specific for it. I've played Namalsk, I've played most of the maps.

You are being disingenuous if you state it is better than standalone. It has more guns and shit, but it looks like some janky ass PS2 game and plays worse. Basically any other milsim or survival game in the market is a more enjoyable experience than the A2 mod, it's below par for even h1z1 by any objective standards... but diehards who started there are blinded by nostalgia just like people with thousands of hours in standalone but only a few hundred in the mod can't deal with shit graphics and animations. You might prefer it more for sentimental attachment, but it has aged poorly and comparable experiences exist in A3 modded servers but with upgrades to every aspect of the game lol.

I don't play Arena over Skyrim for performance or graphics, I do it (rarely, with Dosbox) for nostalgia, because by all objective metrics Skyrim is a better game. I don't play Fallout 1 instead of 4 for the superior fidelity in graphics, I play it because of the memories. I do not have this nostalgia with the mod, but I do with the standalone, and the mod is gross in comparison to A3 mods or DayZ standalone or any number of other games. I would like to sincerely suggest you give a try to some games that are not dead mods of nearly decade old titles. :p

The gameplay loop of the mod doesn't even really resemble that of the standalone that much. Gear is just shat out everywhere in the A2 mod. Feels like PUBG with less looting, shittier graphics, less weapon customization, shittier gunplay. Or like a low rent version of Wasteland or Exile, both of which felt like they did everything the mod did but better. People have lost their damn minds as always with DayZ, trying to compare it just on aesthetics and server performance with what exists only in .62 is farcical already, ludicrous. Might as well compare Pong to SM3, they're just different generations entirely and any comparison saying the old pixelated shit with less mechanical depth is 'better' is relying on nostalgia and not looking at it without those feel-good memories tainting their determination."

Key ingredient to weight loss is diet, have you been disciplined at your food intake? Exercise only help that little bit, it's always no effect if you don't eat clean.

I exercise 6 days a week and no I did not lose much weight because I eat shit a lot. But anyway, rule of thumb: no processed food (like packaged food), replace white rice with better carbs (lower GI carbs) like sweet potatoes, some fruits, vegetables, lean meat, eggs etc. Snack nuts or fruits when hungry. And also cut down and don't purposely add salt into your food when not necessary. Too much salt causes water retention and make you looks rounder.

Also add weight training to your routine. It increases muscle and in turn, it helps you burn more calories. Muscle need energy. More muscle means higher energy burn.

717	"&gt;&gt;The mosque murders were horrific. We rightly deplore them, while honouring the memory of the innocent victims. Nevertheless, an annual day of national atonement and commitment to a campaign dedicated to eradicating specifically anti-Muslim bigotry sends Canadians the wrong message. If six Jews had been killed in a synagogue by a lone bigot, I would hold the same view. Yes, anti-Semitism is a serious issue, but Canada is not an inherently anti-Semitic country, and I would not wish for Canadians to be ritually compelled to assent to that &gt;&gt;falsehood.

No where in the article does it criticize Islam or Muslims, nor does the comment you replied to.  The biggest problem surrounding Islamophobia is that we can't have a serious discussion about it, because every time people are quick to call people racists and bigots for simple criticism.  Why the hell shouldn't I be able to criticize it?  There are ideas and beliefs in Islam that seriously contradict with western values, and we as a country need to have a discussion of how we want to handle those contradictions.  We can't just pretend they don't exist. 

I know it's a played out metaphor, but if you were living in Nazi Germany would you not feel its your right to criticize Nazism?  If the government took a hard stance against anti-Nazi rhetoric (which it did), would you not feel like your right to free speech was violated?

718	"In other news the United States continues to defend its dominion over Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, Israel's expansion into more and more of Palestine, the Golan Heights, etc. ... This has nothing to do with justice or defense of international law. It is a cynical power play, pure and simple. Our government will not let this tiny region go because it's world dominance since WWII has operated in significant part on the mafia principle-- if you defy the world's leading imperial power, you are made an example of. US policy planners' greatest fear, since what they called the ""unipolar moment"" (in which after the fall of the Soviet Union we became the undisputed singular superpower in the global geostrategic power balance) is that one of the rising powers (Russia and China) will be seen to be able to challenge our dominance and to become a competing rival like the USSR was. 

I don't agree with Russia's annexation of Crimea, because I'm against all imperialism, period, but surely people can see how ironic and hypocritical this is... Especially because of the context of *why* Russia is particularly interested in pushing back its border with Ukraine, which happens to never get reported in the neo-Red Scare that the mainstream media has going... See, during the Cold War we created a military alliance called NATO that we claimed was there to counter the threat of Soviet influence in the world (the Warsaw Pact). Well, we made an agreement with Soviet Russia that if they allowed Germany to be reunified under a hostile military alliance (NATO, the West) then we would never expand NATO ""one inch to the East."" So they reunified Germany under NATO. Then we betrayed that deal. We expanded NATO East through Poland, and eventually through Ukraine, which is to say *right up to Russia's border.* Surely if Russia betrayed a deal with us and expanded a hostile military alliance to include Canada or Mexico, we would take that as a form of aggression-- a sign that they were posturing for action against us. I mean, we could have missile systems, including nuclear weapons, in any NATO power, so in Ukraine they could be just kilometers from Russia's border. So Russia has every incentive to push the border back, to make some buffer region between NATO and Moscow. It is not, as the media portrays it, just the insane actions of an irrational or wildly expansionist mad-man. 

As I said, I still oppose the action on ethical grounds, but I also oppose all of the imperialist actions that the US is taking and enabling throughout the world on a daily basis, which if you look into it is quite a lot. At any rate, if we care about reality and truth we have to actually look at historical context, motive, and both sides of the situation, and when we do, the situation is very different than the neoconservative hawks would like us to believe. This is a nuanced situation and in some ways we have been the aggressor and instigator historically. 

All of this saber-rattling and propagandizing strikes me as very alarming-- it's the same thing we've done before every war in the last 50-60 years. We start painting some world leader as the new Hitler, the ultimate enemy of everything good in the world, and then we either foment a coup against them, or impose brutal sanctions that kill hundreds of thousands of people and/or get them into debt bondage so we can impose neoliberal structural adjustment policies to economically strangle them, or if everything else fails we just militarily invade like we did in Vietnam, and Iraq, and Afghanistan, and so on. This is why the few remaining states in the world which defy the American-dominated imperial world system that we have constructed are so defensive... They have seen what has happened in the last 17 years, where we've picked off one government after another after another, and they don't want to be next. This is why they're so desperate for nuclear weapons-- they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein after he gave up his WMDs, Qaddafi after he gave up his WMDs, and now is happening to Assad because he gave up his WMDs, and they think that a nuclear arsenal is the one deterrent that could actually prevent us from taking action against them. This also explains what the few chosen enemies of the US have in common as opposed to our allies. It certainly isn't that they're anti-democratic, because we support and ally with dozens of anti-democratic, dictatorial states. It isn't that they don't respect human rights-- our closest allies are Saudi Arabia! They crucify and behead people, only just recently (on paper) started to allow women to drive, they torture and are massacring people in Yemen, and they finance ISIS... What our enemies have in common is that they have been the ones who tried to operate in some way independently from the US' imperial global capitalist system. 

You can take what I say with a grain of salt, because I know it's not the narrative you're used to hearing. But do some research from sources that aren't corporations, the State Department/Pentagon/CIA, or right-wing think tanks and I think you'll find that I'm telling the truth. And before anyone says the inevitable ""You're a Kremlin agent"" (even though I explicitly condemn Russia's actions) or a ""Trump supporter,"" because I know it's inescapable if you question the validity of this narrative, I am very left-wing. I hate Trump, I hate Putin's brand of autocratic nationalism. And equally I detest the neocons in liberals' clothing that the DNC and politicians like Hillary Clinton now represent. I am as biased as anyone, but on this very partisan issue I am not biased in favor of any of the parties involved, but rather in favor of international law, democracy, and anti-imperialism. At least I wear my biases on my sleeve so that the reader can know where I'm coming from and take that as they may, unlike some people who would try to convince you otherwise. I would encourage you not to just uncritically accept the propaganda of any state (or corporation for that matter). I know it takes a lot of effort to dig past all the punditry and talking points to actually look at the evidence, but unfortunately these days that is the only way of learning anything about the world we're living in."	"That is a plausible explanation, depending on the concentration of the drug. The only other obvious explanation I can think of (if there is higher larger concentration) is that pentobarbital is highly addictive (barbiturates were mainly replaced by benzodiazepines in human use because it was much easier to overdose on barbiturates without mixing them with other depressants, but barbiturates and benzos are both extremely addictive). 

I find this explanation somewhat implausible though. It would make sense to put addictive drugs in human food, because humans choose their food for themselves. Your pet is pretty much going to eat whatever you give them without a say. I guess if you were feeding them this drug-laced food regularly and then switched to another brand, you might notice your pet seemed distressed and switch back, but you might not even connect those dots.

*A fanfiction by ermonas*

Emily 10 was watching Bill on a viewscreen. Her eyes, fixed on the man sitting on a bench in a park, reflected a sad feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia for a time she never lived.

Emily 10 never recovered from what happened to Emily 6. Watching her clone-sister's mind disappear to be replaced with a 5 year old version of her prime was something she just couldn't bear. She wanted to escape, far away, in both time and space. She wanted to be with Bill.

After staring for too long into the viewscreens, Emily 10 was walking by the desolated streets of the red planet when she saw a sign on the door of the Time Travel company: ""90% discount in all travels, just for today"".

She hopped in and asked to be sent to Bill's time. But something went wrong. After she was transported, instead of being with Bill, Emily 10 found herself staring at the eyes of a giant banana, who was just as bewildered as she was.

""RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"", the banana screamed in a high pitched voice, while moving her aside and racing with no clear direction. Emily 10 became even more confused, but soon she saw the reason the banana was so scared: The world was literally falling apart behind them.

Emily 10 ran as fast as she could, but her deteriorations made the task impossible to her: She simply couldn't coordinate the movements needed to run. She saw a giant hole behind her, and was sucked in with an imposible force. She was floating. She saw nothing, felt nothing, and thought she was dead.

But then, in the distance, she heard something. Something that sounded strange, like some sort of foreign or made-up language. But she could still somehow understand the words...

My family has had a car stolen before, and our neighborhood is slowly turning into a shit pile over the years. I decided that it would be best if we had something just in case somebody did decide to break in again.

My parents and I do sometimes have a debate on this, but as I have already killed someone before in self-defense, I don't really mind doing it again if I have to. My parents are getting older, my brother is lazy, and I don't care to use a melee weapon at a possible attacker bigger than me (I am 5'10), so a weapon that can immobilize in seconds is the best option.

1. Meal prep. If you've never done this, just buy a few tupperware and the next time you cook dinner, cook two portions. Or even just two portions of one dish - so if you're doing chicken, rice, and broccoli, cook an extra portion of chicken breast and save it in the fridge. Now you've got a lot less work tomorrow night. You can eventually add other things in as you get more comfortable.

2. You get better at it. Cooking takes me half the time it used to. It's some combination of knife skills (which is huge), knowing how to cook stuff (you can cook stovetop scrambled eggs, on the highest heat settings, in like 90 seconds if you know what you're doing), knowing where everything is and how to get it, prep it, and get it to the burner ASAP. Time management is huge as well, if you're in the kitchen you could probably be doing something that either gets the meal on the table faster, or reduces cleanup time after. Which brings me to my next point...

3. CLEAN WHILE YOU COOK. Fucking crucial if you're going to do this more than one night in a row. 

4. Have some stuff that's ""good enough"". I don't mind a PB&amp;J for lunch, even though outside of the semester I'd never touch jelly, and bread very rarely.

5. Fruit's a nice little supplement. It's really easy to grab an apple and feel good about it. You can't do this for every meal, though, obviously. I just think people forget that fruit is so easy to eat, I never read anything about people eating fruit on this sub. Idk maybe it's ubiquitous so people never talk about it. 

I seem to do okay on this stuff. Another thing that really helped is getting up very early - like 5AM - to get breakfast, hit the gym, and get some studying in. Best of luck!"	"I'm not saying that it's harder to recognize because it's healthy, I'm saying that it's harder to acquire because getting in the habit of working out every day requires initial discipline, planning, and effort, and smoking weed does not. 

It's a barrier of entry thing. I am NOT comparing severity. 

Anyone can be addicted to eating. It's much more likely to find someone addicted to junk food than it is to find someone addicted to cooking themselves elaborate, five course meals every night. The latter requires effort, the other does not. Literally the point of weed is that it floods your brain with dopamine without you expending any effort. 

I don't think it's fair to add exercise to a list of things like gambling, junk food, etc. NOT because it's healthy and those things aren't. I think it's unfair because all of those things are available in abundance for the average person, and they don't really require a person to be in a specific place expending effort.

Group identity has always been paramount in society. All societies have operated this way, and it is not unique in any way to Marxism. Here in America—long before the teachings of Marx became prominent within our borders—society was heavily divided among ethnic and class lines. Down to as little as 1/8th of your ethnic ancestry. Similarly in places like India and the Middle East there were complicated ethnic-religious and class based caste systems. This is not at all a new development. Neither is the exploitation of these divisions, which has reared its head under literally every political and economic system.




The idea of Cultural Marxism seems nonsensical to me because of that simple fact. It’s more of a boogeyman than a real phenomenon. It takes something that already exists within society, slaps the word Marxism on it (because that’s a scary word), and is then used to disparage activist movements.



 This isn’t anything new by the way. To give an example, the US government attempted to used this exact tactic to derail the Civil Rights movement in the 1960’s. Stoke fears Communism. Label prominent Civil Rights leaders as agents of USSR. Direct public attention against them. It failed then and I expect it will fail now throughout the West."

However, I’ve had 3 women approach me and start a relationship with me. They varied in objective attractiveness, as two were technically overweight. One of them absolutely could have landed a hotter dude than me though. I’ve been approached several times by, shall we say, obese women with fewer dating options.

Furthermore, the son who says he has the video has either misplaced it or can't find it and has not provided any other corrobating evidence at this time.  She says she shared the texts of a convo with others, and those people haven't come forward.

So to reiterate,  in one instance, we have mutilple people, including Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge telling us all about his drunken escapades and harassment but he doesn't want an investigation while he prepares to potentially be placed on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment, vs. Someone saying they had a video but no longer and an accussed calling for an investigation of himself into those claims.  He is furthermore mirrored by polling in Minnesota where ~60% want an investigation to determine the facts.

Kavanaugh doesn't want an investigation, Trump, McConnell, Grassley and others don't want an investigation.  Ellison does, Minnesotans do, and a vast majority of Americans want more info on Kavanaugh.

"Consider a man 180cm tall  (6 feet) and say he weighs 80 kg (175 lbs) in his late teens/early 20's he is in good shape and athletic (as would be expected for astronauts).

By the time he is in his mid thirties, if he weighs 120 kg (262 lbs) because he has ""bulked up"" he is heavy but some professional athletes are close to that and can still function well. 

So the assumption is, the extra gravity is similar to hanging extra weight on the overall frame so probably the body can take the extra weight although it will take time to adapt.  

Having less gravity creates all sorts of issues although no studies have been able to test anything close to .5 G. 

Several bodily functions relay on gravity and likely the lower gravity would affect them in unexpected ways. Bone density is an easy one and can be compensated for via exercise regimen. Others may be more difficult.

One concern is likely children developing in low or high gravity. A lot of child development may be affected adversely. "	Music	askscience	1

875	"&gt; Her strategy made perfect sense.

She campaigned hard against the progressive platform pushed by Bernie Sanders until she snuffed out most of the energy on the left. The remaining elements were bitter that she pushed bank interests over people and didn't support her bid to be President for giant banks. She alienated a lot of people in the campaign against Sanders. 

The only way her strategy made sense is working on behalf of the Trump campaign to elect Donald Trump.

After she fought for giant investment banks, she went on to talk about immigration, abortion, open borders, closing coal businesses, and on and on. It was a truck load of red meat ready for the wolves. Her name by itself energizes their base. If you add [immigration, expanding diversity visas, and open borders](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/8/hillary-clinton-dreams-open-borders-leaked-speech-/), the rest is just icing on the cake. There is an argument that making expanding abortion into a campaign issue alienated just enough Catholic voters in key districts to lose her the election.

&gt; It's only in hindsight that we can say she threw the election.

Some of us were saying that all the way up to the point she lost. We tried to sound the alarm that the messaging needed to be squarely on jobs. People won't fight for someone else's right to use a bathroom when they are worried about healthcare, retirement, education, and job security. It simply isn't at the top of the list.

And it's not that I care about the truck but I don't want to deal with people telling me ""I only hit you because you were incorrectly Parked this is your fault yada yada.""

Walking an extra 60 seconds is no big deal.

I don't want to give anyone a reason to give me shit."	"Hahahaaaaa

Cherries are way better than apples.

* Cherry cheese cake
* Cherry cobbler
* Cherry toppings
* Cherry triple layer cakes
* Cherries as a snack

Apple is so cliche, so normal, so boring."	pics	gifs	1
905	"Yup. There's been plenty of PRs where people were told to just use a good ol' for loop. Shit like this:

    someList.stream().forEach(blah -&gt; {
      blah.getSomeSubList().stream().filter(...).forEach(blah -&gt; ... ));

Actually I think most of my issues with it stems from complex anon lambdas embedded in a stream."	Don't be sorry for being right. I can't fathom what mental gymnastics people go through to convince themselves that building new homes isn't a good thing.	programming	offbeat	1
906	I can hear the birdshot coming down around him. I can’t tell the range but it would be hard to hit some person hundreds of yards away with 9mm. 	She is the queen of Canada as well! She used to be my queen but China took her away and now we don’t have a queen. It is not as happy since she left being our queen. 	guns	canada	1
907	The fact that Facebook doesn't even dare to publish this app under their own name already tells you they know it's sketchy as fuck.	What a total asshat. He knows fully well that even if people would read that ridiculously long user agreement, almost no one would even be able to understand most of it without a law degree. I did not sign up for this, zuck.	apple	technology	1
908	"&gt;How does TLJ even have a lower audience RT rating than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice?

Because RT rating isn't a measure of relative quality of a movie. If everyone thinks a movie is mediocre, it would have a 0% freshness on RT. That would be a lower score than a movie where most people think is terrible, but has a few hardcore fanboys."	The supreme court made pretty much the best decision it could with the circumstances it was given, terrible ballot design and JEB! targeting minorities for voter roll purges gave us Bush.	movies	politics	1
909	"Ok, the guy is of course going to run scared. He doesn't want to, nor does he have any reason to, kill the goose. It's not a contest, that man could kill that goose with his bear arms. 

Any sensible person would run away. Perhaps he is a little scared, but he is not going to attack the goose, that'd be dumb. 

That goose talks shit and acts tough, and I'm not saying the guy would be unharmed, but no chance in hell the goose kills the guy before the guy kills the goose. The guy runs away scared not because he is actually threatened by the goose, but because he was startled and doesn't want to get hurt."	"Barbas ? Amazing. Fantastic, funny, witty. Really makes me think He is a daedra's pet.

Belethor? Creepy. Just a weird guy. It brings me joy when I sell him a potion worth 700 septims, and bounce. 

Couldn't tell they were the same people."	gifs	skyrim	1
910	"Being “blunt” is worthless unless you’re educated enough to know what you should be blunt about.

FYI if you really want people to be healthier, they’re going to need more knowledge than just CICO. Otherwise it sounds like you and OP are more into shaming people and being snarky than helping them."	I see what you're saying but there's a clear difference between the two. Spotify upholding their values is only affecting R. Kelly for his individual actions. But a baker refusing to bake any cake for a gay couple is discriminatory against an entire protected class. I'll add that I'm a bit uncomfortable with the baker situation, but it seems to be the lesser of two evils.	Fitness	Music	1
