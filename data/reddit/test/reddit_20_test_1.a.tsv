1	Are you just here to rant? Between your comments on this post and your last one you seem to understand that your relationship isn’t healthy and he is not a good or supportive partner.  You had plenty of ppl telling you that on the last thread but all of your responses are like ‘oh yea guess what else he did!?’ With no real sustenance or action behind it.. So I guess the question is what are you going to do about it? 	"Sounds on your wife just plans on trickle truthing you - as you discover info she will break down and admit to that piece.  She has no intention of coming completely clean.  It shows no respect for your marriage.  

Just some advice,  try not to give her a heads up about going to see a lawyer.  I don't know about your financial situation but you are in an emotional place and although money/finances might not seem important now, down the road you will kick yourself for not getting the best deal, particularly in terms of your pension or long term assets.   You should definitely grab screen shots of texts and info about her affair partner, although  many states are no fault, they may consider fault when looking into division of assets.

Good luck"	relationships	relationships	-1

8	"Well we know the spectral lines of Hydrogen, or the light equivalent of fingerprints of elements, as well as every other element on the periodic table. Galaxies are a big mush of these elements (although mostly H and He). Redshifting causes these spectral lines to shift to the left on the electromagnetic spectrum, or redshift, because if they were for some reason blue, they would be more red in color than what we know they truly are.

So we know where these spectral lines SHOULD be for elements that **aren't** moving away or towards from us, and we compare that to what we see in galaxies. A bit of math tells us how fast it's moving away from us"	"Feeding them antibiotics is mainly bc it makes animals grow bigger.


Certain antibotics, when given in low, sub-therapeutic doses, are known to improve feed conversion efficiency (more output, such as muscle or milk, for a given amount of feed) and may promote greater growth, most likely by affecting gut flora.

https://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/growth-promotants-and-production-enhancers/antimicrobial-feed-additives

According to the National Office of Animal Health (NOAH, 2001), antibiotic growth promoters are used to ""help growing animals digest their food more efficiently, get maximum benefit from it and allow them to develop into strong and healthy individuals"". Although the mechanism underpinning their action is unclear, it is believed that the antibiotics suppress sensitive populations of bacteria in the intestines. It has been estimated that as much as 6 per cent of the net energy in the pig diet could be lost due to microbial fermentation in the intestine (Jensen, 1998). If the microbial population could be better controlled, it is possible that the lost energy could be diverted to growth.

9	"Gotcha.  Good luck, hopefully the pain will become more manageable in time.

Step ups are a good one if they don't bother your knees for sure. You could try box squats once you feel comfortable to ease your way back into heavier lifting. Those should definitely be easier on your knee joints. Same with doing a squat from a deadstop on the rack. Kinda like a rack pull but for legs instead of back."	Personally in my opinion the best way to increase the number of pull ups you can do in a row is to perform other lat targeted work and variations of the same excersize at different weight and intensity. Always do overhanded pullups instead of underhanded chinups because the majority of people neglect their lats and a chinup is very back-bicep based so a pull up is better. 	Fitness	Fitness	-1

31	"I'm not sure how you can look at this clip and conclude that the big push is for ""small-arms-only legislation"", whatever that means. 

When asked how they would define ""assault weapon"" for the purpose of a ban, they give one, and Rubio explains to them that that would involve banning nearly every available weapon on the market (outside of revolvers, shotguns, and bolt-action or lever-action rifles, none of which have a large market share). And what do they do? They go fucking crazy for it. 

Some of them are honest about wanting confiscation. Others lie about it. Still more - probably a plurality, honestly - don't entirely understand the ramifications of what they want (i.e. banning semi-automatics). But that is the push that is coming. 

Now, why don't I believe it's actually going to happen? This is a deep wedge issue that would leave red state Democrats - and there are still several in the Senate - sharply vulnerable to challenges from the left. They'd either get primary'd by a Berniebro that will get slaughtered in general elex Montana or Arizona or forced to answer that they support such a ban, which will lose them the moderate support they need to hang on in their state.

33	"Yes, each pixel is a time signal. You can represent any finite discrete time series as discrete fourier samples, or any integral continuous time sample as a fourier transform function.

The problem here is that this representation does not compress the redundancy present in video very well. Fourier samples compress a static image well through high frequency precision discarding (where you store more precisely the lower frequencies). If you did the same to the temporal axis of a moving picture, you would get bluriness in moving objects and certain odd ringing phenomena. Also, this process would not be able to compress a common situation that is a translating object in the scene. In the time domain it's easy to detect moving objects and encode the (object, velocity) information allowing very good extrapolation and hence compression. Imagine it, for example, as storing a picture of a ball and its vector velocity, and simply displacing it every frame the given velocity (if the movement is uniform then you get extremely good compression).

The basis of compressibility is twofold: 

1) Exploiting the limits of human senses and which artifacts humans don't mind (e.g. we can't distinguish past certain framerate/resolution) -- that's what discerns lossy compression; 

2) Exploiting the limited variability (i.e. compact distribution) of signals, in particular given starting information. If I give you the first frame of a video, it's not like anything else could come next (with high probability -- anything could come but certain nonsense is very unlikely), what comes next is almost always extremely predictable. Computationally efficiently predictable patterns are thus used to limit the data that needs to be encoded within the restricted predicted set, or as an error signal between the prediction and the true outcome (this error signal being small for predictable signals)."

 Every book must have protagonists, because nobody will care  if some random new character saves the world, it has to be someone you care  about, someone you saw growing throughout the series.

This characters also have to go trough adverseties to the story, not only to grow but to create tension in the middle part of the story and make it interesting.

42	"Got my barb to 70 and kitted out with various sets and after running a few GR60s with Raekor variations I can't figure out why Boulder Toss is the preferred spender and why cube slots are more used towards boosting Furious Charge.

Most builds I see run Standoff + Vile Wards in cube so your FC is your primary damage, but that was my slowest run by far with roughly 6:30 left on the clock.

Then I went for a build more focused around Boulder Toss, slotting both Three Hundreth Spear and Skular's Salvation. It was a bit faster, finishing with 7:45 ish left on the clock.

Lastly I went with Fury of the Vanished Peak and Bracers of Destruction, using the Rumble rune on Seismic Slam. I dropped my time down a ton, close to 10 minutes left on the GR timer.

Furthermore if I look at the math we have the following:

*FC: 500% of Movement Speed * 40% via sprrint + 20% via WotB so 300%ish boost, (assuming speeds are additive which I'm not sure of) and then vile ward which is # of enemies dependent.*

*BT: 60% + 250% (against 5 or fewer) so 310% total boosts.*

*Rumble: 500% + 500% to the first 5 enemies so 1000% potential boosts.*

Numbers line up with my experience, but my experience doesn't line up with the leaderboards. So why are most folks near the top running Standoff/Boulder Toss?"	"The issue is that he got a primal that rolled CDR and Str. And in typing this I realize you are right

If he rolls the STR to CHD (giving up 1k STR) and then letting him re-roll CDR on one of his rings to (assuming he has socket/CHD/CHC as he should) the best would be flat damage or 500 str.

The answer is going to depend on what else he has. Eventually that primal has to go (in favor of socket / crit / crit / ele). But rolling the str away could be good if he has sub ideal rings (meaning he is currently sacrificing crit for CDR) or like a really good SoJ or something.

If he has correct stats everywhere else, then CDR to crit, but there are some cases (missed CDR rolls elsewhere), where rolling the Str would be better."	Diablo	Diablo	-1

WoW was designed from the ground up to keep you playing (and paying) forever.

Guild Wars was designed by ex-WoW devs specifically to counter some of WoW's fundamental design philosophy - XP grind, gear treadmill, monthly fees, PvP you can't opt out of.

ArenaNet started as a small studio without Blizzard's resources, so as the company grew and the finances and development scope grew, they found there was stuff they wanted to do that they couldn't do within the limitations of the existing game. So they chose to end Guild Wars 1 to work on Guild Wars 2."	The real answer is to set up a local proxy (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/6417dl/psa_ps4_slow_downloads_fix_2017/).

However, after connecting through a local proxy, my PS4 downloads have stayed at 60+MB/s consistently (on a gigabit connection), while without the proxy the average speed is maybe 1MB/s with frequent dips to 400-500KB/s.

88	"&gt;Racially homogenous population

America is still white by a large margin. And since 57% of white Americans are, at best, willing to ignore racism in the highest office of government, i'd say that willing to accept a master race principle isn't too far of a leap. It doesn't take a majority to support that, it just requires a vocal minority, and an apathetic majority. 

&gt;Ongoing pogroms against citizens because of their perceived race?

Police target minorities at a significantly higher rate than white people. Black men receive, on average, significantly harsher sentences than whites who committed similar crimes. Black murderers are more likely to receive the death penalty. I can go on and on about the racial bias in our justice system if you have the time, I wrote a 15 page paper on it recently.

&gt;Armed clashes between political parties

While true that not arms were involved, there has been an increasing amount of politically motivated violence. From mass shootings to people driving cars through protests.


No one's saying that the current administration is literally doing exactly what the Nazi's did at the height of their power. But the direction that our nation is moving is toward one of racial violence and white supremacy.

Moses sent his spies and when they reported of said giants, Moses decided not to enter the Promised Land and God essentially levied the same punishment as he had when Moses had struck the rock twice.

109	"I'm an RF engineer. The frequency at which a microwave oven operates is fixed for several reasons. One is that the frequency is optimized at the resonant frequency of the water molecule to maximize the energy transfer to the food. The second is that the magnetron is a tuned cavity resonator, so it would be impractical to modulate the frequency because its output frequency is determined by the dimensions of the cavities. The third is that the magnetron gets RF energy into the oven cavity via a waveguide and horn antenna, which is also a narrow band device if you want to transfer the maximum amount of RF power without absorbing it or reflecting it back into the source. Older microwave ovens, and some commercial ovens have a hidden ""stirrer"", which is a reflective metal fan blade that sits in the output horn of the waveguide and reflects some of the energy around the oven cavity to even up the power transfer. Other ovens use a somewhat more effective turntable to move the food instead. Some food is just really difficult to heat evenly if the water content isn't distributed in a homogeneous manner, so in that case it works better to use a lower power setting and a longer cook time. It is also better to place the food off-center on the turntable."	"Tetramethylbenzidine, or TMB, is a chemical used in a lot of immunoassays.

People vote, people go to doctors, people make purchases, etc. An educated populace make certain decisions when they vote, make medical decisions, and purchase goods. So where does evolution come in?

Experts have to know way more than what is taught in schools. In fact, I don't know what's taught in schools, I graduated high school over a decade and a half ago, and there was no formal education in evolution. An undergrad course in evolution I had taken back in the day was merely a primer into a dense field. I'm assuming evolution would be taught that emphasized evolution from populations to speciation, as well as higher classification differentiation, and, most importantly, the scientific evidence. The utility of that in everyday life to the individual means nothing, neither would history, anything beyond basic mathematics, literature, etc. The collective effort of these courses would provide the foundation for college education, but, more importantly, even without seeking college, they encourage critical thinking skills. Appropriate instruction methods in these skills should translate to healthy skepticism of claims, and adequate heuristics in teasing sense from nonsense. Creationism is just another seed of doubt on the scientific method. Students become confused as they're misled regarding what constitutes evidence, and led to believe that a PhD, alone, qualifies someone to dissent in a field they have no expertise in. Sometimes this can lead to, generally, harmless results. Linus Pauling made sweeping claims about the positive health properties of vitamin C. His status as a Nobel Prize winning scientist gave him substantial public influence that led the vitamin C craze, but the evidence wasn't there. Today, evidence suggests vitamin C can reduce the duration and lessen the severity of colds, but not prevent them, and certainly cannot, as he argued, cure cancer."

It is 5:51 long. The finale starts at 5:17, and follows a slower part that hints at things to come. The whole theme up until the finale is like that, a build up, a promise, and a softening and contemplation, followed by another slightly more powerful buildup, and so on. Then at 5:17 you get metals and a slower build up and a long note accompanied by drums , the note gets interrupted while the drums keep you in suspense, then the note picks up again, long, insisting, and finally ends in a very satisfying cymbal BANG!

Then during the finale I'm actually pumping and we are together, and that final, insistent note is my own orgasm, hopefully accompanied by another one of hers. The finale is so good, so satisfying, so promising, because of what came before (pun not intended).

Without the foreplay, the finale is still interesting, but it does not compare to the whole symphony. If a sexual encounter would last, say, 45 minutes, then the in-and-out is the last 5 minutes and feels much better because of the 40 minutes that happened before."

*Vague dates like ""coming soon"" or ""shipping soon"" to lure pre-orders is outlawed in Germany, after a Munich Regional High Court ruling, in which a litigant took reseller MediaMarkt to court over excessive delivery delays. For any retailer to sell a pre-order for a commodity or a digital software license (i.e. take payment before product launch date),* ***the reseller must specify the exact date of on which the product will be delivered.*** *In other words, the onus is on the reseller to specify when a buyer will have the product or digital license in their possession, before making the sale, and ensure that the product reaches the consumer on or before the specified date.*

***Resellers that are unable to specify a delivery date would be breaking the law by soliciting pre-orders.*** *The new ruling bolsters Germany's consumer rights laws, which are among the strictest in the world. German consumers are already within their rights to return a product they don't like for no reason, within a finite amount of time after the sale. If a retailer delivers later than the specified delivery date, the consumer can refuse the product and become eligible for a full refund. Perhaps the biggest impact of this ruling will fall on the real-estate industry. Real-estate developers taking payments from home-buyers before the completion of the development (i.e. transfer of possession) of a property, must be ready to cough up a full-refund (adjusted by inflation), if the buyer doesn't get possession on the agreed delivery date.*"	Games	Games	-1

&gt; Regarding the Vedas, they are śruti, which means they they were originally knowledge transmitted by hearing.

So the Vedas began as an oral tradition. What do you believe about any potential for variance over the years of telling and retelling the stories?

141	"A few years back I was just starting work at this not so great paying job, still hurting from the joblessness, and I went in to get gas. The gas station was kind of a mob scene, and it took like 20 minutes to get to the register and everyone was just kind of annoyed and a little rudish. I got to the front of the line and asked for $5.00 in gas, which at the time was like $4.00 a gallon. I think I had to use a dollar in quarters too. Just enough to get to work where I would get paid and get more gas later.

I was pumping gas and finished and put the pump back when it immediately beeped and said ""prepaid $10"" on the screen. I assumed it was an accident and started to get in my car when this woman starts screaming from across the parking lot and waving her hands ""You've got extra gas! You got 10$ more!"". I thought she was trying to say that she accidentally put the 10$ on my pump and thought I pumped it (I didn't). She kept saying it like that for a  few more times and finally walked closer and said ""I paid for $10 more gas for you!"" which is when it hit me, she didn't do it by accident, she was trying to give me a break and help me out.

She explained that she knows how little gas $5.00 is and how she's had to buy just enough gas for the day before too, and just thought I was really polite even though the whole store was full of angry people. I teared up and thanked her profusely.

It made my day and I've never forgotten it. I think of her probably every time I pump gas. I've since paid it forward in similar ways and those small acts of generosity really show on peoples faces when you can tell they are struggling. I always wished I had her contact information so I could pay her back, or show her my appreciation somehow."

The only area at any risk doing ETTR is losing **detail in the highlights** if you clip them (go over the right edge), the shadows only ever gain detail by doing ETTR. If I were capturing an image in a dark room without any bright lights, ETTR is the best thing I would do, because dark scenes have the biggest issues with noise/banding/texture-loss and gaining extra light by going +1 or +2 or +3 means less noise, less banding, less texture-loss, so the scene will look just as dark after processing, but cleaner and more detailed."	photography	photography	-1

152	"&gt; Let me make my argument clear. Whatever your morality standard is, that is your god.

You have a very odd definition of the word 'god'. How do you define that word?

&gt; If God commands me to go kill someone, it would be good to kill that person. Otherwise he is not my God.

"	"Friend, I would say be cautious about joining any church for your development.

Not that there are no benefits in joining a community of like minded people to strengthen your growth and knowledge, I only want to address the tendency to give up your own authority to decide what is right, what is true, how to behave, or the truth of love and life. Don't depend on any external power or authority to tell you the truth of your being.

I recommend not to seek the reality of Love outside in any churches or dogmas, not to trust in any rituals, myths or agendas but to seek Love at the only place where it resides, seek it in the wisdom of your own heart and let Love teach you of itself.

Indeed, God is Love. But unfortunately, the word 'God' has been associated with so many negative things now that when you mention it, people immediately think of punishment, cruelty, egotistical maniac, or condemnation and judgement.

I am not a Christian, nor a Bible scholar, but I believe there is a verse in the Bible that says: ""God is love and he who abides in Love, abides in God and God abides in him."" 

But sadly, not many religions nowadays adheres to this principle. Many churches are now only trying to extend their own agenda, to maintain their position and power or manipulation of the mass, so many unthinkable deeds had been done in the name of God. 

But truly, Love is the major principle of the One Fundamental Energy, that I shall call Divine Consciousness. Of course, as the One Central Energy is Life itself, it embodies all characteristics of all beings within the omniverse, but its major principles are very few and Love is perhaps its most important expression.

Other sublime qualities of Divine Consciousness are absolute Truth, Intelligence, Omniscience, Joy, Compassion...etc. 

Great Avatars have come and taught the appropriate message tailored to the people with respect to their abilities, cultural tendency and geological regions so there are many approaches to the One. 

Major Avatars who exhibit this sublime quality of Divine Love are Sri Ramakrishna(1836 - 1886) of India and Jeshua ben Joseph of Nazareth or better known as his english name Jesus the Christ.(4 BC - 30 AD)

Unlike the Buddha Gautama(563 BC - 483 BC), who emanates the Omniscience aspect of the Godhood, Ramakrishna and Jesus concentrated on Love, the highest non-egoistical form, which in its final development makes the man a sage, i.e. a perfect being. 

""Love thy neighbor as thyself"", and ""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another"" said Jesus somewhere in the bible. 

However, it is rather difficult nowadays to find a church that adheres to the true teaching of Jesus Christ.  Many Christian churches are consumed in power and greed to further their religious heresy and maintain their wealth. These churches are a disgrace to the name of the Christ. 

That said, if you seek to grow within a community, the Unity Church seems to embody the loving message of Christ very closely, with major stresses on love, forgiveness, acceptance of all people etc...

They offer very good teaching of the Christ Jesus. There are others too but I don't have much knowledge about them to recommend. 

You may find some teachings of the current Dalai Lama very helpful. Compassion is one of his major themes. 

The highest treasure though are the unseen teachings scattered around the world, but are unnoticed by the public eye and only appear to those who have eyes and ears to seek them. 

Your heart has spoken, my friend, let it guide you forward. May peace be with you always. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

I think it's weird and shitty that we're talking about how and when we wear dresses, how we choose undergarments for dresses, and tips on how to cover our private areas.
Ladies, we all cover our bits when we wear dresses. That's what the fucking dress does. It's clothing. If someone goes under you, they're trying to bypass your clothing and are violating your personal space to do so.
Design a glass catwalk over a busy hotel lobby? You're violating people's personal space, same as hiding under the stairs.
If we choose to wear longer dresses or different underlayers when we wear short dresses for vigorous activies, that's due to our own personal sense of privacy.
E.g. I don't wear ankle pants. Hate them, I have swollen ankles all the time and I look gross in ankle pants. Sometimes I choose to wear shorts or dresses anyway, like when it's hot or if I'm feeling fashiony. What I cover and what I show is a personal choice.
Undergarments are a personal choice. As long as our genitals aren't visible to everyone, then we've covered our body to the acceptable societal standard. Grey sweatpants with our doodle somewhat outlined? Technically OK. Short dress no panties but we're walking around not bending over? Technically OK. Keeping it technically OK is our only OBLIGATION.
Wearing lingerie/booty/tap/boxer/yoga/bike shorts under our dress, for doing normal activity, is a CONCESSION.
Us sitting here and trading tips on our favorite way to make that concession is understandable but feels icky. OP did her obligation: she wore technically OK clothing. Let's point the blame where it belongs: with pervs.
WE shouldn't have to make concessions. We do, for different reasons, including fear. Don't you all get sick of making concessions?
Guys make concessions too (not usually to pervy women). We all struggle with concessions and obligations. Not just a woman thing but in terms of sheer numbers, concessions to pervs is very much part of the women's experience.

180	"They are both OK, it's only a problem when someone uses ""female"" at a much much higher rate than they use male (or vice versa but I've never seen it or a culture pushing it).

&gt; Yea I was trying to remember if it was just drunk sex but I am pretty sure I woke up because I only remember the end where I realized what was happening and I got up to go to the bathroom.

&gt; Thank you. I really helps me to see it from an outside perspective. He was also drunk at the time but he said he remembers everything so ot as drunk as me.

-----------

If you're unable to consent, you're unable to consent. What OP is describing here isn't ""had a couple of drinks and got tipsy drunk."" It's ""best case scenario, I was blacked out, because if I was then maybe he didn't rape me."" 

You can initiate things with an unconscious partner and have it be totally fine from a consent perspective. It's called having those discussions in advance. MrPantzen knows that he's got free reign to try to wake me up if he's awake and feeling it in the middle of the night *unless* I've told him earlier that I'm not in the mood. But, you can't just stick your dick in an unconscious person and assume it's fine because they've had sex with you a bunch before. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.
"	"The other thing about the “never would have done it sober” issue is that it doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of consent.  People will disagree with this analogy, and it’s not completely on point, but I think about it like I think about a taco truck.  When I’m sober, I’d never go near one of those things — the food is greasy and cheesy and must be 1000 calories a bite.  But drunk me loves them — drunk me will walk 20 blocks for one.  That I would never eat that stuff sober, and that I often wake up thinking “oh my god why did I go to the taco truck again?,” doesn’t mean that I don’t consent.  It’s a bad choice every time — but it’s mine, and I make it.

The same is true if I get moderately drunk and decide to agree to sex because it seems like a good idea.  I’m not out cold, I’m not beyond understanding, but I’m feeling good and making choices I might not otherwise make, and that I might later regret.  Sure, sober me wouldn’t do it.  And it would be a good idea for me not to do that — just like I should lay off the tacos.  But at the end of the day, that’s my choice with my body, and while I should make good choices... I have the right to make bad ones. "	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	-1

"The extremely high incidence of abusive backgrounds in criminals, and the specific claim about serial rapists being abused by women as children, are both common knowledge among feminists who work on those topics.  They are not denied or suppressed.   

There is the expected scepticism because criminals are motivated to invent or exaggerate an abusive background as a mitigating factor in sentencing, but I don't see feminists doing that more than anyone else.  

I knew almost nothing about Breivik but your first paragraph immediately made me think ""narcissist mother"", which turns out to be the case.   They both were severe narcissists.   The mix of heredity and the specific type of abuse narcissists do often creates narcissism or BPD and makes it common for people to be able to identify three generations of narcissists in their family.  

I have a lot of contact with children of narcissists.  Direct sexual abuse by the parents is unusual, though very much more common than in the general population.   A much more typical scenario is a narc mother ignoring or tolerating her live in BF's abuse of her daughter, blaming it on the daughter if she is told.   

I know someone who was made to sleep with her horrifically abusive narcissist mother until I think 15.  It was not sexual, and I've seen other similar cases with Nmoms so you should not assume a sexual aspect just from that.   
You mentioned her encouraging him to touch another man's penis.  That could be all sorts of N monkey business, you can't classify it as sexually motivated abuse without further info.   

A grotesque lack of insight is normal for narcissists, his claim his mother had nothing to do with it seems ridiculous after reading a review of Seierstad's book on him.

I have a couple family members who have gone this route, too, and it's unfortunate because I don't want to be around them. They are toxic, negative, and the irresponsible use of deliberate and egregious misinformation sets an extremely bad example for others, particularly children.

These are people who would have once scolded their kids for using the type of Twitter insult Donald Trump slings, but now go out of their way to justify it. I don't really have any way to justify their behavior - it's simply bad, and while they're certainly within rights to be negative, malicious, and misleading, I don't see any reason to be their audience. Especially since any attempt at reason is met with hostility or conspiracy theory. Note, by the way, this isn't even political reason. This is reasoning like ""Would your mother have appreciated the type language you just used? Would you teach it to your own kids?"" Or, ""That information is verifiably inaccurate and here is a source to the actual data."" Those aren't political refutations, they aren't coming from or using a political source, they're just attempts at grounding someone in reality and reasonable discussion.

However, let us not forget that similarly to taking the base game too far in the direction of ""1000 car, M4s for everyone"", there is also a line that should not be crossed towards the other side of the spectrum. There is a difference between a mechanic/design choice being hard and challenging, and one that is simply put, stupid and unnecessary. As much as I also want the base game to be a challenge, I'm not for praising incompetemtly designed systems, with the only justification or merit being making the game more inaccesible. Just a reminder that there is still a middle ground that need to be achieved, let's not let our bias towards one end or the other ruin the bade experience, like said mods will take care of those extremes.

213	"There is the third way, the middle road that is usually here in my country. Whenever there's a strike, it be private or public sector, not everyone is taken out in a strike. Also the government is never really a part of the employer - employee conflict. A strike in every sector is legal, as long as it's not imposing an immediate risk for the public's health and safety.

Take health care workers, for instance. In a hospital it's not just taking care of emergency patients. They have a lot of people doing administrative work, surgeries that aren't curing life threatening conditions etc. The union along with the employers will sit down and take out a sensible amount of workers out in strike. The same goes for police etc. It's the administrative duties and non-emergency duties that go first. For instance here the police issue passports, so if the police is striking you probably won't get a passport. 

Schools being out doesn't inflict an immediate threat to the public's health and safety, especially considering the first teachers to be taken out in strike will be the teachers of students that are old enough to stay home alone. 

IMO this is a good option because it gives the employees the ability to strike if need be, however you are guaranteed that the government steps in if it goes too far. And usually once the government steps in with a forced agreement they will find some kind of middle path, meaning you could easily get something that neither the union or the employer are happy with, so it's also in their interest to come to an agreement. 

Also it's not in the government's interest to screw over the employees. This is people's jobs you're potentially fucking with, and that is something people will remember.

I think Kavanaugh was just coached to use angry denials to all Democrat questions, because it would play well on conservative TV, as opposed to answering their questions with humility.

&gt;I'm proposing an upgrade to Litecoin with a soft fork that will let miners signal their min accepted fee in the block header. This will let a fee market develop without having us decide what the min fee is. Will also make it easier for users to estimate fees. More details later.

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949746681662205952
&gt;1/ Technical info: Use 5 of the version bits (fee_bits) to specify min fee rate 

&gt;min_fee_rate = 2^fee_bits (in litoshi) 

&gt;Soft fork enforces that all transaction in that block has a fee rate higher than min_fee_rate and that fee_bits is set to highest possible.

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949747438117535744
&gt;2/ This accomplishes 2 things. 

&gt;1) min fee rate is stored in block headers, so SPV clients can look at it to more easily calculate a good fee. For example, median min fee rate of last 100 blocks means that &gt;50% of hashrate will mine that transaction. So it should confirm in 2 blk

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949748150201303040
&gt;3/ 

&gt;2) Miners can choose to not mine low fee transactions to signal to the market to increase the fees. This should help create a fee market.

&gt;If mining is competitive, this should lead to a good fee market. I'm convinced this will work. I think worthwhile to test on Litecoin.

-

https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949751747186122752
&gt;4/ As @pwuille pointed out, out of band fee payments can skew the results. But I think median min fee rate will not be skewed much at all and will be useful. 

&gt;The other important thing is to remove us (developers) from deciding and changing what the min fee and relay fee is.

Your opponent can’t run you over if you have chump blockers

Your opponent doesn’t draw just counter spells

Your opponent is playing a game of chance just like you are, and when your game of chance only needs to resolve one 3 mana(because you are never casting this for 4 mana) artifact to win the game eventually, that is very unbalanced

Things you can do now 
1)Pod Voice of Resurgence into Renegade Rallier returning voice

2) If you have a sac outlet already; pod Saffi into Renegade Rallier, return Saffi, generate infinite ETB triggers

3) Easily find infinite mana with Devoted Druid and Vizear

243	Thanks! Honestly, it sounded alright for someone who is super seriously into Christianity and spreading the gospel around the world. I’m just fundamentally opposed to that whole idea, so all Christian churches are cults in my view, and converting third worlders to Christianity is wrong on so many levels. But I understand that for a Christian it’s a simple matter of saving souls and racking up brownie points with God so your heavenly mansion is bigger. That’s all cool and everything, but I’d love to see humankind reject all of the crazy ancient religions. There are some modern views of spirituality that make so much more sense and are much less harmful to women, gay people, children, animals, the planet, politics... well, you know. 😊	"Only it's not ""universally"" accepted.

The bonuses they provide are reasonable and are not off the charts to be OP. But whats disturbing is the Magic Damage Reduced by % on the Rathma's shield. I dont remember such mechanic in the game on any other item - the only way to get magic damage reduction is by stacking it from different items, which is fixed number and not percentage. Whats interesting though is the description down below of how this works: ""All magic damage is reduced, except cold, fire and lightning"". This mechanic makes only sence if this 1.15 patch thing brings new boss encounter of some sort, which is dealing heavy Magic damage (think of Blessed Hammer or Bone Spirit skills), which I HIGHLY doubt will happen, therefore I think its fake."

The current system is so flawed, and for a number of reasons. We are placing way too much weight on the actions and decisions of 18–22 year olds, which has negative impact for them and for society as a whole.

I’m sort of the poster child for this issue. I was always a smart kid (not trying to brag this is just a relevant detail) who became increasingly disinterested in school due to the fact that I didn’t really see any value in most of it, but more importantly due to undiagnosed depression. Things were at their worst in college when I slept about half of the day away and just barely maintained grades good enough to avoid being kicked out of school. I was finally diagnosed with depression during my senior year and things began to turn around for me, and by the time I graduated I was in a good place. I realized a few years later that graduate school was in order, but I felt like my options were really limited due to the old cumulative GPA weighing me down. I could apply myself as much as I wanted and could do everything perfectly in the present tense, but I couldn’t escape a number that represented me as a depressed 19 year old who really had no relation to the present tense version of me.

I managed to get into school and became a physical therapist, and now I’m planning to apply to medical school in 2019, but I really feel like I defied the odds to get to this point. I very easily could have spent years applying to schools with no success, and I would have been stuck at a dead end with no ability to pursue certain paths even if I was doing everything in my power to further myself. This current system was so close to keeping me from doing the things I’m capable of doing, as well as keeping me from becoming a more productive member of society that might fill a needed role in healthcare or whatever else I may have found as a calling.

A good home cooked meal would have been much cheaper and shows your friend you are making an effort not only to see them but also do something nice for them. 

I actually have issues with this as well. I have a friend who doesn't ever want to eat food made at home and vociferously dissents when it comes up, even wanting to pay for my meal rather than eating something his wife cooks at home, or something I cook when he visits. 

Both me and his wife love to cook and are probably more skilled than average. I have friends over *to* cook for and with. It's actually really frustrating because it also becomes an issue with other social things like potlucks on game nights, complaining until everyone just agrees that we'll order pizza instead.

"A couple days ago I was running around Hope County. I decided to go fishing off a small dock in a lagoon somewhere in Jacobs territory. 

As I was fishing off the dock, minding my own business, I spotted a patrol boat sailing up the river. I continued catching trout as I watched the driver sail straight through my line towards the dock. She did a sharp turn and ended up crashing her boat right on top of my dock. 

For the next five minutes I sat there while the stranded boat driver kept complimenting me while ranting about the cult. The boats gunner was hanging around on the shore when all of a sudden he started shooting. Out of no where a bear runs up and attacks me. The boat driver didn’t make it and her friend got knocked down, but I picked him back up. 

After killing the bear, I continued on with fishing for the next ten or so minutes. I started hearing the faint sound of a planes motor. The sound got closer and closer. I looked up from my little dock and saw the plane for a brief moment. Very quickly the plane took a nosedive right into the hillside surrounding the lagoon. 

All of this happened within the course of thirty or so minutes. I did manage to catch plenty of trout in that lagoon! I’ve been really enjoying my time vacationing in Hope County. "	gaming	gaming	-1

On a desktop you have many processes that all run at the same time and are competing for resources which can slow things down if it gets too overloaded. However things work differently on mobile platforms. People don't realize that apps aren't always running in the background and that iOS ""freezes"" them and will kill them off completely if it needs more resources. People still think you need to close apps to get better performance out of the device. This logic is also perpetuated by these stupid ""cleaning"" apps that claim to improve device performance cleaning cache or killing processes or whatever ridiculous crap they claim these days. There's probably also some kind of OCD component where people don't like things being in the app switcher even though they known they're not running.

Also a lot of publishers are moving to server side ad insertion for video ad assets. This gets around adblockers because everything gets transcoded as one stream, passed into the player, and played. The only way to block the ad in this case would be to block the entire video stream. 

Also there are a lot of systems at play and some of the larger more reputable publishers are actively fighting against fraud, malware, malvertising, etc... being injected into user pages. If you make users angry they will go somewhere else (abandon the site) or find ways around the problem (ie.. adblockers). 

Believe it or not ads can be incredibly complicated to implement and monitor. There is also pressure from the online community, the governing bodies that create ad standards, the ad servers changing their specs, the ad networks, agencies, and advertisers themselves. 

Things are constantly in flux and I personally do not want to be the guy that causes the sites I work with to get attacked by malware.

Take for instance your bit,

This was a common fallacious rabbit hole theists would drag the argument down; atheism=belief, theism=belief, belief=belief, belief=religion, atheism=religion, therefore you're the same as us and either belief is equally likely.

Couple that with the word ""belief"" being used as a synonym for religion, ""belief"" became a pejorative word to those atheists, so now they reject out of hand by creating the a/gnostic-a/theist combination and claiming they do not have a belief. 

Otherwise, I would agree with the rejection of nouveau atheists' defining of words like atheist and agnostic as *the* definitions of the words, and think ""agnostic atheist"" is a cop out term and ""gnostic atheist"" is, or should be, untenable to an atheist.

330	"&gt;&gt; No. I, like most of the middle class (who used to make good money doing manufacturing jobs), have had our jobs shipped overseas so that corporations can pay workers less.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is a natural evolution of a capitalist economy. 

I don't understand why people like you think that shareholders - who provide virtually nothing to a company - deserve all the company profits, while workers struggle to make ends meet.  Or need a second job.  And are denied healthcare, and medical leave, and just a plain vacation.

If all the workers are ""used up"" (physically and emotionally), there will be no workers to make the product that the rentiers depend on  for their profit.

Also, when all the resources are used up, where are the 1% going get their higher ""returns""?

&gt;People running corporations have a fiduciary duty to do their best to maximize profit for their investors, not employ more expensive workers.

Shouldn't they also take care of their resources?  Workers are a resource.  Once the people in Asia are tired of being treated as slaves, they'll demand more rights and higher wages and be ""more expensive""...

&gt;&gt;I said ""the world"", not a terrorist sect in Nigeria.

&gt;You don't think the US Navy has ships patrolling the globe? Now, who's willfully ignorant?

I don't even know what you're trying to say.

&gt;&gt;Do you even care about the old growth palm forests in Indonesia?

&gt;What, you want to give our EPA dominion over the entire planet now?

Of course not.  I expect corporations to take better care of the planet's resources rather than rape the entire thing.  It's the only planet humans can live on, after all.

They could use products that are produced using sustainable practices.  (Which is what was promised, but there will be a slight delay since there's still some old growth forest out there.  You know, killing the dodo bird was an accident caused by ignorance.  You can't say that we're killing species out of ignorance now.)

&gt;&gt;As far as healthcare goes, we all pay for the uninsured.

&gt;...if we go to a single payer system, so it will be cheaper (according to collectivists everywhere), that's when you really see the costs spike, since it will drive demand through the roof.

According to whom?

&gt;And how many people file for bankruptcy due to medical costs? You think that's not paid for by the rest of us?

&gt;&gt;So, your solution is to subsidize those people that don't pay for their own care even more, driving up demand even more.

Wut?  No.   Universal healthcare would ensure that middle class people - who own their own homes - don't have to file for medical bankruptcy and become one of those homeless people who failed at capitalism that you so despise.

&gt;&gt;And ask any retiree if they want to get rid of their Medicare.

&gt;They only wouldn't want to get rid of it because they've paid into it their whole lives.

You're assuming.  Maybe they actually like the care they receive.

&gt;you hate weapons manufacturers don't you? 

No.  I hate that our government wastes money on weapons because we don't need to be fighting so many of the *undeclared wars* that we're involved in.

That is not transparency, and the citizens have no real way to not only understand the decisions our country makes, but to ultimately STOP our country from making decisions we do not agree with. 

We can disagree with a war AFTER we've already invaded and possibly influence policy, but how are we supposed to stop it from happening in the first place?

This agreement has stipulations based on conduct while in the course of completing the requirements of the job. If someone were to deliberately break that contract by say, raping children you were employed to care for, you no longer qualify for the benefits of employment if the contract stipulated no rape.

If you disagree and think that an employee should still get their pension, I would like a better argument than other people get their 401k even if they break the law. It's a completely different contract and if child rapists want to have a comfortable retirement they should try harder to not get caught or have a contract that doesn't say your pension is dispersed after review based on several criteria including the PPA(Pension Protection Act). This Act is there to protect employees from companies fraudulently withholding pensions but has clear cut stipulations on why and how this can be done.

&gt;Khabib Nurmagomedov doesn’t sound fired up. He doesn’t sound bothered, actually.

&gt;Just hours after Conor McGregor and his friends stormed a bus carrying Nurmagomedov and other fighters competing on Saturday’s UFC 223 card in the Barclays Center loading dock, Nurmagomedov said he wasn’t impressed by Team McGregor’s antics.

&gt;""I am laughing inside,” Nurmagomedov said. “You broke window? Why? Come inside. You know UFC don’t let you come inside. If you real gangster why don’t you come inside?

&gt;""This is big history gangster place. Brooklyn. You want to talk to me? Send me location. We have to talk? I am gonna come, no problem.

&gt;""I grew up like this. I don’t grow up throwing chairs at window. This is not my bus.”

&gt;Following Thursday’s media day at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., McGregor, as well as members of his team, entered the arena. According to sources with knowledge of the situation, they arrived in “retaliation” against Nurmagomedov and his team cornering Artem Lobov, a teammate and good friend of McGregor’s, earlier in the week.

379	I was thinking of General Motors.  I heard GM has a much higher production cost compared with Toyota or Honda due to the UAW.  This is reflected in their final product as the quality isn't as good as their overseas rivals.  Not sure though how true it was.	"I've read the 9.9% article the Atlantic published, I don't believe it exonerates the 1% or the .01%. The article simply adds another detail of the stratification of the economy and the current inequality. The people that are reading the Atlantic, or the NY times and watching MSNBC/FOX/CNN/YOUTUBE NEWS are likely a part of this 9.9%. They have kids getting tutored for the SATs, they have money but feel it isn't enough bc everyone in America is looking upwards at the billionaires instead of surveying the levels below and seeing that if they just gave up a little bit, everyone would be better off. But I do want to say the 9.9% article is really fantastically written and worth a read purely on it's own merits as an article.

In this article they say Reeves and Stewart are arguing it's a conscious effort by people in these upper brackets to hoard wealth which, at least for Stewart's article, is not exactly what he's arguing. The argument, as I read it, is much closer to : the 9.9% act out of self preservation spending on tutors for their kids and locking up their zipcodes (NIMBYism) as the only way to maintain their place in the economy; to maintain their property value and avoid the high expense of college tuition. However, the 1% tends to actively push other down by not paying higher wages, by funding politicians that will obey, etc. 

I think this distinction is important though certainly not an excuse. I have a family member who is practically a case study of being in the 9.9%- free college, fell into a cush job selling insurance and yet his siblings are unable to pay their mortgage but his only suggestion is for them to work harder, to hustle. Two have gone back to school (now indebted), one works 2 jobs and has a roommate, no health insurance and no retirement at 59. Yet they aren't working hard enough. He spent his summer in Florida in a condo he owns. 

The point of that story is he isn't unwilling to help but he is unable to understand the issues of the lower class in America. He doesn't see that housing is too large of an expense on the avg salary or health insurance (which he sells) isn't economical. 

I suggest reading both articles and keeping your salt shaker close for both in case you find some distasteful points that don't mesh well with other sources.

Here's the article in question: The Atlantic: The 9.9 Percent Is the New American Aristocracy.
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/?utm_source=feed


Edit: The main attack in this article is on sloppy data by Stewart (I agree) and Reeves points which I cannot contest/defend or comment on as I haven't read the book (Dream Hoarders). I found Stewart's article important precisely bc of it's grouping which states that even owning property and having a net worth is better than 90% of Americans. Having security in the resource of shelter (parents home or otherwise) is an important safety net that many go without. 

TL;DR the stratification by Stewart is oversimplified but, I think, helpful in organizing the inequality argument and definitions of wealth and isn't ""distracting"" from the problem of the 1% but clarifying the levels of the economy. Cannot and will not defend speak to the attack on Reeves."	Economics	Economics	-1

Nobody is saying this move is going to singlehandedly save an LGS, but it truly does help. The fact that this promotion has limited quantities means people who want it often need to preorder to get them. Preorders are huge for LGSs. The money that sits in product upon a new release is a massive burden for stores. Preorders allow stores to free up their funds from being tied up waiting for release and waiting to sell, and allow that money to be invested in other places."

386	"&gt; The exploit description makes it seem like the downloaded resources aren't code signed by Blizzard?

The exploit description doesn't mention anything about pushing downloaded resources to the client through the Blizzard app.  From what it says:

&gt; Exploitation would involve using network drives, or setting destination to ""Downloads"" and making the browser install dlls, datafiles, etc

Looks like the exploit here is to force the payload into the browser's download directory (or, probably, more easily into the browser's cache directory), then repointing the Blizzard app to think that's where a game is installed and asking the app to launch it.  Their 'fix' is to make it so the client doesn't believe any browser executable is a game, so the app can't be used to launch and send command-line arguments to a browser in order to further instrument an intrusion (e.g., having the browser download a payload that the app can then execute in a separate command).

Blizzard's app only downloads content via Blizzard's CDN (which is basically Bittorrent-based) and directed via catalog files served up from their own servers, so the attack here isn't forcing the app to download an arbitrary payload.  The attack here is tricking the app into *executing* an already-downloaded payload because the app doesn't verify that what it's asked to execute is genuine Blizzard code, it just trusts whatever's in the 'game directory'."

My company had an event with a former president as the keynote speaker. My boss got me a meet and greet pic with him as a reward for working the conference.

The most recent example was from an adult student in a colleague’s class (we’re both instructors). He asked if I had kids. I said I do not. He gasped and *demanded* to know why. I politely but icily told him it was none of his concern and turned to talk to someone else. 

Before that, I had a colleague angrily snap “well *I* think you’d be an *excellent* mother!” after asking if my now-husband and I were planning on having children. I told him I disagreed and left the conversation.

And for the record, there's much infighting within the libertarian community about reforming the libertarian party. I wouldn't suggest taking the LP's approach as the libertarian ""manifesto"" to how libertarians think and believe.

Qur'an 4:90

There is a context to this verse which I'd encourage you to look up."	"&gt; The assumption in the OP question is the the belief was true, not that these people knew the belief was true.

The assumption in the OP question is that the two James's were presenting themselves as eyewitnesses of the events they claimed to believe and that they died on the basis of the belief. That's the clear subtext of OPs question and a common argument presented as evidence for the resurrection... I know you don't find it compelling and I don't blame you... but that *is* the argument. 

&gt;  Julius Caesar actually wrote books, and we have primary accounts of what was happening in the Roman Empire.

Exactly my point... we know what happened on the basis of primary accounts including Julius Caesar's own book. We know what was in that book on the basis of some very good manuscript evidence: 12 manuscripts the earliest of which is from the 9th century.... yes Virginia, that is considered good and reliable evidence when you're talking about ancient documents.

&gt; To say Jesus is a god or the God is an extraordinary claim, and you have to give us extraordinary evidence.

I didn't make that claim as a matter of historical record though I happen to believe it as a matter of religious faith. 

But I think it's worth noting that *you* are willing to believe that Julius Caesar wrote his account of the Gallic wars and that the text we have is roughly correct on the basis of 12(!) manuscripts the very oldest one we have being transcribed 900 years(!) after his death.

My point as you well know is NOT that we have any reason to doubt the historicity of Caesar or to seriously doubt what he wrote in his account of the Gallic wars. It's to point out your astounding double standard when it comes to assessing the reliability of the text based upon manuscript evidence. The Bible is absolutely unique when it comes to the level of manuscript evidence we have. We have 5,800 greek manuscripts, another 10,000 latin ones, and another ~10K or so in various other languages.... ignore the translations and you're still talking more than twice what have for the nearest competitor: 2000 manuscripts of the Illiad. With the oldest fragmentary papyri of the Illiad being a mere 400 years after Homer's death as opposed to less than a century with the New Testament making the Illiad by far the best attested document we have from the ancient world. For all the rest of ancient literature you're talking about hundreds of manuscripts for the best attested but more often mere dozens and 1000 years or more between the oldest copy we have and the original being written. 

If we consistently applied your level of skepticism about manuscript evidence to every other document and you'd have to throw out almost everything in your history books before the renaissance and a good deal of what came after."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

Only Difference being, one was always too busy to go on an actual date with me and the second one was willing to go or reschedule when date night happened to be on a busy night.

Even my ex did that. Some guy who was a masseur was also trying to get to her when we were starting dating. He was like, ""I really need some practice, would you be interested in free massage?"". She said why not and multiple times even scheduled a time but she never went, always canceled at the last minute. That guy was pretty consistent and that probably went on for 1-2 months, before he gave up. Poor guy, lol. But shame on my ex for leading him on. Point of it is that she might be interested in another dude.

I would do this- drop all communication for a day or two. See if she picks up conversation her self (sign of intrest). Yet, if she does not, that dosent mean she is not interested (although, it is not too great of a sign), maybe she is waiting for you to make the move (again).

After 2-3 days of silence, pick up the conversation your self and eventually ask her out again. If she declines again, move on. There is probably someone else. If she is interested she will make room for you.

450	"So you had a few questions there. To start though, you're going to want to be super careful with running when you're that heavy. It can and will wreck your knees. If they hurt, stop and see a doctor about whether you should continue.

To answer your questions:

- As you're new to running, the volume there is pretty low. C25K is designed to get your joints used to the stress and your cardio able to keep up. I think you'll be fine adding leg work to your lifting routine. It will probably help a lot with injury prevention. Running while overweight is super hard on your joints, but being strong enough to keep good form when you're tired can help.

- With the rest of your lifting, at this level it isn't really going to interfere with your running. TBH I would pick any program that looks reasonable from the sidebar, maybe focus on one that can be done in 2-3 days a week so you have more time for running. Your only real limit right now is going to be the amount of time you want to commit; I don't know how long a day of C25K takes for you, but most of the commonly-used lifting routines take about an hour in the gym.

As to the rest, well, you know the story. Getting control of your diet and stopping smoking are going to be the best things you can do for both running and lifting. Your post is full of red flags of someone who hasn't figured out that your health is completely under your own control, and is not dictated by outside factors:

&gt; Nutrition is tough because I always go for cheap and easy options 

""I'm too lazy to follow a healthy diet"". It's harder to be overweight than it is to eat healthy. I know, I've been there.

&gt; I have access to a gym, but it can be busy.

All those people at the gym are there working out even though it's busy. That's not stopping them.

&gt; I've tried doing better with eating

""I've tried"" implies that you failed, or at least you aren't being consistent. Figure out why and fix that. You can't outrun a bad diet.

Don't make excuses, don't give yourself permission to fail because then you will.

Just a couple thoughts in case they're worth anything. First, way to stay on top of this. Your bill is absolutely too high, something's not right. Do not back off until you get this resolved.

First, this probably goes without saying, make sure your electric supplier is ComEd. There are all kinds of other electric companies that will come to your door and convince you to sign up for their plan. Some are on the up and up, but anyone who advertises to you will jack up the price to ridiculous amounts. You should be paying ~$0.07/kWh or so and your bill should say who your supplier is. Double check this.

If you haven't already, start keeping weekly records of your own electric meter reading. It sounds like you can access it. If this matches up with ComEd's numbers then it's not their fault for billing you what they do. If it's not lining up and it's way off, then it is ComEd's problem. I'm going to assume it's not ComEd, but if you have proof they're somehow not reading your meter right it should be pretty straightforward (fingers crossed) to convince them it's their fault.

Ok, so assuming it's not ComEd, but your meter is actually reading really high rates of usage. In that case something in the building is wired wrong. I won't speculate what, but this would be the responsibility of your landlord to address.

You also said something that made it sound like maybe your meter isn't reading at all and only the building meter was reading? If this is true then your usage is being estimated with all of your neighbors and someone is doing a botched job of it. In this case I would take it up with your landlord and you might also have to get ComEd involved. I was looking for anything specific to ComEd with shared meters and couldn't find anything, but as a tenant you should have your own meter that's metering only your usage. Check out this page for New York's utility's guidelines (https://www.coned.com/en/accounts-billing/how-to-read-your-meter/shared-meters) and I imagine ComEd has sort of similar policies at least.

As a tenant you have pretty good rights in Chicago. Check this out (https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/rents_right.html). If your electricity usage is like you say it is you should have a $50 bill this time of year, not $250. Contact your landlord and say you need this dealt with and ask them to have an electrician out to look at the wiring (if this is what it seems like it is). Don't threaten them, but be very firm that this is their responsibility to deal with promptly. Worst case, hire an electrician yourself to come out and look at it and give you their opinion. Get them to give you a quick signed note explaining their findings that you can use to help motivate your landlord to action.

Conquest was the best received Fates game by long time fans. It's the best game to come out of Intelligent Systems in a decade but that doesn't mean much on the back end. If Birthright sold more, which it did, and sold more DLC, which it likely did, that's likely the direction they'll take the series. I'm not going to believe the company who pumped Awakening full of horrible DLC, fixed that DLC somewhat in Fates, and then went went an even worse DLC model in Echoes and is currently riding gachapon revenue is going to make decisions for the gameplay above the profits. That's not how current IS operates. We don't have someone like Kaga telling his team to remake FE4 again late into development to make it perfect. Fire Emblem went into cost savings mode with Shadow Dragon and even though they're out of the hole they're still working with the money first mindset. I'm pretty sure Higuchi only got his FE2 remake because he was able to shove a season pass into it. 

They've also said they're not doing a FE4 remake next. Higuchi wants to make an FE6 remake next which is the most practical decision considering how much the West craves Elibe content and how Roy is a household name thanks to Smash. I'd be okay with this since I doubt I'd be happy with how they would handle FE4 and FE5. As a long time fan myself (started with FE7 on release, played every game related to the series except Berwick Saga), I see no reason to be excited for the future of the series. I have many reasons to be cautiously optimistic, but I'm not going to pretend like Conquest wasn't a fluke. We got ONE good Fire Emblem game out of the past five, and that good one was bundled with a mediocre casual pleaser and one of the worst FE games ever released. There also isn't much of a reason to be excited for how Echoes was presented given that Maeda and the main team has been working on FE Switch for a few years and had nothing to do with Echoes which was developed by a smaller separate team. It's like when people hoped for Path of Radiance to take cues from Sacred Stones. "	Games	Games	-1

I take advantage of the fact that it pushes people out of their comfort zone (this is the keyword here, and why I feel most people get annoyed with Tinker rather than him being ""OP""). He simply requires a different approach to beat or play, but most people just want to stick with what they've been doing every game.

Most players employ reactionary Dota when playing against Tinker instead of trying to anticipate his movements. This usually leads to failure and frustration. When I play against Tinker, I try to put myself in their shoes. It's relatively easy stopping him from the get-go, unless the opponent is significantly higher skilled.

I say this because I have personal experience with friends and pub strangers alike that are upset when they have to play vs Tinker, yet they don't make any effort in thinking outside the box. No early ganks, no Tinker wards, no anticipation of where he will try to TP next; just plain old ""try to catch him in a team fight and hope for the best""."

On the topic of boarding buses I should not board, I once boarded a bus to Barcelona from my home in Lyon because I really missed the beach and Barcelona was relatively close (6hrs by bus - which for an Aussie is no big deal). Well, Barcelona was great but their beach isn't very nice so I decided I would go to Seville (I know, wait for it). Turns out Seville is very far which I didn't realise so I ended up taking a bus to Madrid where I couchsurfed for two days before buying a ticket to Seville. On the last day my host asked me why I was going to Seville and I said ""for the beach"". Turns out there is no beach in Seville because it's not on the damn coast - I'm not sure why I had that in my head but for some reason Seville to me was *the* beach location in Spain.

We tried it, after an hour figured it was no good and then WHAM-O! It definitely worked! We went for a walk and I called another friend who was a frequent tripper. He immediately dropped and set off to meet us. We met up, feeling awesome and walked over to Kensington to chill and smoke some herb at this lounge. We sat out back on the patio when a guy came by and dropped us some samples of bud (not uncommon there) but gave us more than an eight between the three of us (SCORE!). Then one of the baristas comes up to us and says ""Hey, there's this crazy guy from the Netherlands inside demoing a vaporizer he invented but he's leaving soon, you should check it out!"" So we're like ""Hell yeah!"" And go inside and check out [The Verdamper](https://www.vaposhop.com/vaporizers/home-vaporizers/verdamper/) which is an amazing vapo/bong combo thing. We chatted with him for almost 2 hours before he had to leave or he was going to miss his flight. He kept talking and talking (mostly in Dutch) and was such a nice and friendly guy. When we tried to use our bud that the guy had given us before (which was quite nice stuff) he scoffed and pulled out a selection of top notch strains for us to choose from.

504	"&gt;You substituted for that premise in an effort to pare it.

The premise is necessarily true in both arguments. It is a fundamental truth required to make a choice. I simply spelled it out in mine.

&gt;You merely replaced God with ""will/nature"" of a person, but that's not what's in your first premise.

A person's will/nature is always in effect. I didn't say it explicitly but one cannot choose without having some form of agency. 

&gt;The point of free will is to have choice.

Free will allows someone to choose according to one's will/nature and not purely external factors. It isn't some unobserved quantum state.

&gt;That premise is far from tautological. People's will conflicts with their nature all of the time. If you confuse the two, it's no wonder you're so misguided. By definition, our will, if it's free, can't limit our choices.

I haven't conflated the two, I have ""merely"" avoided committing to either, as to show this works under any form of determinism, free will, or compatisbilism between the two. That is, regardless of the source of our agency, our agency has causal effect through our choices, free or otherwise. That causal effect guarantees only one possible outcome regardless of foreknowledge of the outcome.

To distinguish this outcome, from the outcome in the presence of God's foreknowledge, one needs to show a change in the conclusion. That only works if you can say it is now ""necessarily true"" that an outcome follows. 

&gt;You've said God has to have the causal power to make the choice necessary. By pointing that out, I'm refuting your argument. If you don't dispute that now, you don't really have a point.

I never said that. I said God's **foreknowledge** would have to have causal power. If perfect foreknowledge was given to someone else, it too would have to have causal power.

&gt;He's likely using ""necessary"" in the colloquial sense, and I suspect you know that, which makes you very disingenuous.

Taking a word at face value is disingenuous? I don't even have a response for that. I would kindly suggest softening the tone, focusing on the argument a bit more, and me a bit less.

&gt;And of course anything limiting what's possible conflicts with free will. Will, as I've pointed out, does no such thing, and nature certainly can. If it does, we don't possess free will.

Depending how you define free will. In any case I'm not making this argument. I'm merely showing why the original argument, in that form, is no longer considered viable in academia.

There are much better, and more importantly, viable, arguments one could make.

508	"&gt;Wrong. Most refugees are economic migrants who just can’t be bothered to do it legally. IE: they’re lazy and breaking the law to enter Australia. A great start right gnar? I’m sure the rest of their stay will be different!

By definition a refugee isn't an economic migrant as they are fleeing persecution, not simply migrating to improve their economic situation. The article you linked to is speaking about asylum seekers, not refugees. Even Howard's quote explicitly says as much: ""A whole bunch of people who seek to come to this country are economic migrants, who are seeking to comport themselves as refugees.”

&gt;How do you know they are a refugee when they enter with no documentation?

You use the procedures that are in place for exactly this type of thing. The UN will even do it for you if there is no domestic framework in place.

&gt;These refugees fly into Indonesia using a passport then ‘lose’ it before they enter Australia. Why’s that gnar when it makes them harder to identify as the genuine refugee they no doubt are?

People fleeing persecution may have nay number of reasons for doing so. To dismiss out of hand anybody seeking asylum because they don't have documentation is a breach of international law. Besides, the bulk of asylum-seekers that seek Australia's protection are found to be genuine refugees, which again means they aren't simply economic migrants.

If no then only Brotherhood. 2003 version went anime original after some point because manga was still ongoing while brotherhood is full canon adaptation but they are still totally different stories that both deserve watching. 

**[Shinsekai Yori.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz1ypuGJ3VM)** Show about post apocalyptic world, but in not usual post 
apocalyptic setting. There are a lot of philosophic and psychological things along with interesting story and some very interesting plot twists. 

**[Parasyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm8UjBAS3cs)** Interesting story, a lot of gore, some romance. Very interesting to keep track of how main character changes during the whole show

**[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt26CSwCNao)** This is mystery thriller in detective style with pretty interesting story. It also has some pretty violent scenes.

**[Made In Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91G8m9uM_0)** Don't be fooled by art style of the show, it's not happy children on happy adventure show. Probably the darkest show of this year(well, 2017 :P). Has very interesting story and world building.

**[Cowboy Bebop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)** Personally I didn't like it a lot but this is indeed classic, it's really atmospheric and at some point you should definitely watch it.


**[Hunter x Hunter \(2011\)](https://youtu.be/28vSZ34w4mA?t=34s)** It's your not usual shounen.The show has pretty interesting story and surprisingly likable*(no matter how strange this may sound)* villains. It's worth all it's ~150 episodes.


**[Spice and Wolf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_WgwEmRaw)** Very calm and beautiful show in medieval setting that follows adventures of traveling merchant and his wise wolf :).


**[Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C337shIT9LI)** Pretty popular and very unique show. Hard to describe it, it has comedy, slice of life, sci-fi, ~~Hitler~~ and one of the best male characters with his inner beautiful sarcastic monologue. Also sequel movie is masterpiece.

**[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wPbJlFBUw)** Probably the best hype show out there.

511	"&gt; You're pretty optimistic considering Microsoft did this exact same thing when they were ahead with the Xbox 360.

This is why I made my comment above. OG Xbox -&gt; 360 was a complete platform change, so was 360 -&gt; One. Now the Xbox One is the only platform that will get incremental console upgrades but retain the platform and current library of games (including BC games). They can't cop out and say ""well this technology (cross play) is not possible yet for this generation"" and stop supporting it, they literally have to go out of their way to disable it. Making already released games like Rocket League and Fortnite just stop supporting crossplay. That will be a PR nightmare.

Not to mention XBOX has transitioned from being Microsoft's ""console department"" to being Microsoft's gaming brand, aka PC is part of it. First party games like Gears 4 and Sea of Thieves support crossplay between PC, that would be like taking an entire 360 stance (no pun intended) on the situation."

512	Can’t make something more perfect than it is and Table Tennis was perfect. Also got it as a gift from someone who didn’t know nothing about gaming but saw the Xbox 360 and got it for me, I looked at it and thought I was gonna hate it; that was the day I learned not to judge a game by the cover. Which makes my library a bit too big tbh	"If the assumption that the devs can implement better web physics but choose not to is correct then the solution I would propose is just having it as an option to toggle on and off.

513	"Frankly, we don't know at all what Mueller has. We do know that everyone around manafort was offered a plea deal, which says to me Mueller is not interested in flipping him. Manafort is corrupt enough that Mueller decided he was a one of the primary targets of the investigation. This trial is showing that judgment to be well considered. 

  I honestly don't think Mueller needs manafort to prove collusion. Just yesterday Trump admited in a foolhardy PR move that Trump Jr, manafort, kushner, Cohen and others met with someone they knew was connected to the Russian government for dirt on Clinton at Trump tower. That's proof of collusion, he admitted on Twitter no less. He admitted to something like 4 crimes, right there, and no amount of saying ""its not illegal"" in a tweet will change the law. 

Just from public data(trumps tweets, Trump Jr's emails, Cohen statements, etc) from the people involved, collusion is clear. Mueller likely has facts, evidence and testimony we can't imagine.  Of course, we will have to wait and see, but flipping manafort is likely not his concern at all. "	"He was the company.

Hello r/MensRights,

My club is officially approved!! It will be mentioned in the morning announcements for a week and I have posted fliers around the school. 

I have also announced the formation of the club to all my classes. I went in with a heavy chest and fast breathing expecting backlash, however this wasn't the case. Many people nodded heads and clapped and there were few glares and outrage. I am so happy that people were listening. 

I know this is not the case for many people and groups involving men's rights, so I will use people's openness as an opportunity and not waste it. The first meeting will be about how to be a good listener, rules of conversation, general expectations, misconceptions about the MRM, and what it means to be a supporter of men's rights.

&gt; There's nothing stopping anyone on your team from trading everything they know about your operation for a briefcase full of cash right now.

It's extremely rare that a reputable company would ever agree to something so explicitly criminal, even assuming the person on our team would. And it doesn't work that way, they can't just sit in a room and write down everything they know. It's lots of small details that will be filled in various places, that will interlock with details they can't fill in that will have to come from people in the hiring company. So they basically have to work with them over a period of time.

The whole point with non-competes is that while they are restrictive, paid non-competes are sufficiently reasonably (and they're usually quite narrow too; I could e.g. go work for Google or even many finance companies that aren't direct competitors the morning after I quit my job) that they don't incentivize the worker to break the law.

##### My simple and incomprehensive rapid guide to API engineering
___

I honestly believe it’s difficult to fully quantify a series of steps to becoming an engineer. It’s comparable to having an artistic style in writing or music composition.

What I will say is there’s resources that can help jump start your journey through the wonderful world of development.

By no means is this comprehensive or static, if you start down this path and come across a path of your own take it.

###### Starting Advice

-    Remain Confident, you got this. Don’t let anyone discourage you or say you can’t do it. Part of my biggest problem going into development in the corporate world was management telling me I didn’t know what I was doing until my coworkers told me I knew more than I thought I knew or management would give me credit for.

-    Your application doesn’t need to be incredible or disruptive, you’ll soon find even some of the simplest solutions you craft still require decent structure and technique.

-    Remember, this is the mastery of Input/Output. Upon input (if there’s an input), your function should perform an operation and return an output (if there’s an output)

-    Keep it functional. . . Your functions and methods should accomplish one task. It makes testing your code easier since you can test individual operations one by one instead of one giant function each time. What a task is, is up to your discretion. Ex: *convert a string to uppercase*, *update a database record*, *validate user input*

###### Incomprehensive Guide

549	"Disclaimer: I'm not religious what so ever....

So if a priest is convicted of child molestation and it's proven, at that point I believe they would no longer be ordained. Meaning up until that point when the church condemns them they can give a blessing of any sort as an actual catholic priest. 

That being said if you're argument is that they lose their credibility the moment the act occurs (the act being molesting a child or some other heinous crime/sin), then I would in a sense also agree this is the case as it would be considered a sin I believe to molest a child, and therefore the priest would no longer be on a moral path to his god, but rather to some version of Hell. However the sin of the priest doesn't invalidate the beliefs of the people performing the Eucharist, and presumably the ritual was conducted the same way otherwise. So why would the Wafer and Wine be any less symbolic or meaningful to the believer who is otherwise unaware of the Priests misdeeds and themselves still presumably on a righteous path to their god? 

Following that logic is like saying a famous atheist scientist who made a startling and impactful discovery would have their work be invalidated if they were to later be found out to have mollested a child or any other crime of the sort. 

Or if you'd like another analogy, it would be like saying Bill Cosby's comedy or Kevin Spacey's acting were to no longer be considered good simply because of the disgusting criminal acts they were later exposed of.

P.S. When you insert matters of opinion like the ""brainwashed"" comment you left in parenthesis, you come across as a complete asshole and give non-religious people a bad name. "	"&gt;Would I enforce what?

The notion is: 'Lucky' people are more open to unexpected windfalls. They might go out, socialize, meet someone they weren't expecting, network, and gain unpredictable opportunities from it. The 'unlucky' people more try to force the one thing they want.

That said, there could still be some use for the anti-MOA here. If our justification for the premise that an MGB is possible is the same sort of justification which we would offer for the possibility that an MGB does not exist, then we can show that our reasoning produces a contradiction. Namely, by our reasoning, we should consider both the MOA and the anti-MOA as sound, which is clearly untrue. 

For example, proponents of the MOA will sometimes claim that since we can *conceive* of an MGB as existing that therefore it possibly exists. However, we might similarly *conceive* of an MGB not existing, which would entail that it possibly does not exist. However, that cannot be right since it would entail that an MGB is contingent. Hence, in this example, our inference from conceivability to possibility is flawed."	"One statistically improbably thing is absolutely possible.  Many in a row starts to approach ""maybe this is a sign of something"".  But I fully admit that the glitching and the improbabilities may just be in my mind.

And I don't believe that others are apostates or heretics or simulated agents.  I'm not sure what other people are, but I suspect that they're similar to me: conscious beings in a simulated reality.  And being nice to them, helping them, makes me happy, so I'm an altruist for selfish reasons.

I think that's overlooked a lot when people debate morality.  We have an in-built sense of right and wrong: our emotions.  We naturally feel bad when those around us are in pain and feel happy when those around us are happy.  Whether we're in a simulation or not doesn't change that.

edit: and how do you decide what's true?  All you can really know is things that have predictive power, and those are things that are ""true"" as long as the universe is how you think it is.  All you can really know for sure is that you exist, right?  Everything else is mediated through your senses, which could be deceiving you.

It's terribly important that your digital presence recruits for you — that it speaks to the people and players you're trying to reach. Now you have coaches competing via tweets. I understand why it's important but that's not something I miss necessarily.   


So social media is crucial to the recruiting process these days. Once upon a time it was a much more straightforward and limited process. Before you could visit a home, make an impression on the parents and they discussed with a recruit the advantages and disadvantages of a particular school. Now the school has its own following and that following influences the recruiting class to get them to attend. Many times a friend or a classmate can have a huge impact in getting a player on making a decision. Before it was just the parents and now its expanded to include more people who you never had to consider before. Also now social media allows you to communicate with a player constantly where we were much more restricted before."	lol, the point of the season is finding the CHAMPION.

Only kind of.  The Nazis held 37% seats in the Reichstag after the 1932 Presidential election which Hitler *lost* to Hindenburg (admittedly, with 37% of Germans voting for Hitler).  But in early 1933 Hindenburg caved and made Hitler Chancellor.  Hitler then convinced Hindenburg to rule by decree after calling a new election.  In that 1933 election the Nazis took 44% of Reichstag seats and, along with other, smaller right wing parties, was able to form a Government.  Once the Nazis had a majority voting bloc, they changed the laws to give Hitler power. The last attempt to get rid of those powers was snuffed out by Nazi brownshirts storming a meeting and Hitler's power was consolidated.

So Hitler never won an election personally, though after the (Nazi prompted) burning of the Reichstag building Germans did give the Nazis and their right-wing allies enough power to take over."	Libertarian	Libertarian	-1

Christians believe that Jesus is indeed fully human and fully divine, always was and always will be.

Matthew 15:21-28 New King James Version (NKJV): A Gentile Shows Her Faith

21 Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”
23 But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.”
24 But He answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
25 Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
26 But He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”
27 And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

Orthodoxy Study Bibles explanation: 
“15:22 This woman shows immeasurable love—she so identifies with the sufferings of her daughter that she cries “Have mercy on me,” for she sees her daughter’s well-being as her own and her daughter’s sufferings as her own.”
“15:23 Christ refuses to answer, not only because she is a Gentile and His ministry before His passion is first to the Jews, but also to reveal this woman’s profound faith and love. Several of the Fathers see the disciple’s request to send her away as an attempt to persuade Jesus to heal the daughter, as if to say, “Give her what she wants so that she will leave.” Christ’s response indicates this interpretation is correct, for He again refuses to heal the daughter.”
“15:26-28 Having evoked this woman’s love and persistent faith, Christ now reveals her humility. She accepts her place beneath the Jews, who were the chosen people of God, yet still desires a share in God’s grace. Christ’s hesitancy was not a lack of compassion, but a conscious means of revealing the virtues of this woman, both to the disciples and for her own sake. Her ultimate acceptance by Christ also points to the gathering of the Gentiles into the Church after Pentecost, no longer as dogs, but as children who are invited to eat the bread of eternal life.”

* Fast Forward to 2014 when thanks to the improvement and prevalence of cell phone cameras and the ease for videos to go viral outside of their normal circles - America is treated to videos of black people being killed by police officers on an almost weekly basis. (You can argue that some of these murders are justified killings, but others are clearly not. It looks bad)

* Investigations are done and things like the [Ferguson Report](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf) paint a picture of a department with insanely racist practices - which are enabled by a general lack of oversight and hero worship that many departments enjoy in post 9/11 America. 

* The San Franciso police department is found to have their own insanely racist issues and their text messages are released as part of a [growing scandal](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SFPD-s-texting-scandal-Court-rules-officers-12955853.php)

* Representing an outraged community, a black quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers (An American football team) decides to protest the anthem in the preseason games of the 2016 season.

* After initial backlash and an open letter, Kaepernick spoke to [Navy Seal Nate Boyer](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/veteran-kaepernick-take-a-knee-anthem/) From this point on, Kaepernick kneels instead of sitting, to be more respectful about his protest.

&gt;We sorta came to a middle ground where he would take a knee alongside his teammate. Soldiers take a knee in front of a fallen brother’s grave, you know, to show respect.

* [Conservative media outlets](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/take-a-knee-how-conservative-media-is-reacting-to-nfl-protestors) and Donald Trump begin twisting the protests anyway to be less about a quiet protest to raise awareness of issues facing their communities and framing them as being disrespectful to the military.

* The quotes from now President Donald Trump prompts a show of unity from players around the league and more people begin kneeling in protest than ever, with owners standing on the sidelines with their players arm in arm.

* Kaepernick finds himself, likely due to pressure on owners in the league out of a job despite being a [Pretty Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I0cUTXwr-k) option.

* The President makes disparaging remarks and continues to use the NFL protests as a rallying cry - falsely equivocating the protests as being anti-military so as to distract from issues of police brutality and appeal to a base that believes that people being beaten and killed by police are just ""getting what they deserve,"" because of things like Trump [retweeting graphics](https://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/trump-retweets-bogus-crime-graphic/) that originated in places like stormfront.

"	"All EU countries set the same tariff, and yes you are right it is based on engine size, type of fuel, hybrid etc. The EU is one market so the tariff is the same. The variation comes within the VAT rate which can vary from country to country.

European manufactures are also charged VAT on their output, so that levels the field a bit

However there is also a VAT charge on the tariff itself.

* Making Frying Pan from Aluminum Foil with Hydraulic Press

"In essence it all comes down to how a particular wavelength of light (a laser produces just one specific wavelength) interacts with a certain material.

You know how you can sit inside a sunny car all day and not get a sunburn?  That's because the wavelength of light that interacts with your skin to give you a sunburn interacts so well with glass that it's mostly all absorbed.  Or X-rays can go straight through a sheet of glass but can't go through a sheet of lead.

So to make a laser that does you want, you find a specific wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible light, UV light, IR, X-rays, Gamma Rays, etc) that reacts with the material you want, to do what you want.  (or in more practical terms, you see if any of the available wavelengths of laser available will work since you can't just order any specific wavelength of laser you want).

So for printers they found a laser that would melt the plastic toner pellets and fuse them to the paper.  (750nm)

For rust removal it's a wavelength that will heat up and evaporate rust but mostly reflects off the shiny metal underneath.

Tattoo removal uses one that breaks up the ink particles but mostly doesn't interact with skin.

TL;DR: It's not that **a** laser can do so many things, it's that there are tons of different kinds of laser that do different things to different things. 

Bonus content: There is also the fact that the laser energy can be stored or ""charged up"" and released in pulses up to millions of times per second and that will change how the beam interacts as well.  You can have a continuous low level of energy up to extremely short (femtosecond 1/1,000,000,000,000,000th of a second) but high energy pulses."	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	-1

Like, either:

A) He really believes this and, for some reason feels entitled to a very specific type of girl (what type that is I can't say, since ""better looking"" is so subjective) and legitimately feels that you don't measure up, meaning that he's more or less keeping you around until this mythical ""better"" girl appears and gives him the time of day and relationship he feels he deserves. Thus, he is a useless shithead who doesn't see women as people and is okay with treating people as disposable placeholders until he gets what he ""really"" wants.

or

B) He is saying these things specifically to break you down, because he wants you to feel like you're less than in the relationship and thus put you on the defensive, so you feel like you're afraid of him walking away whenever this mythical ""better looking"" woman suddenly appears and for some reason becomes entranced by... his shitty personality and misogyny, I guess? He wants you to feel like you're never going to measure up so that you are always feeling obligated to fight and claw and compromise to 'win' his affection, so that you'll bend over backwards to give him whatever he wants because he has you so broken down and afraid of him abandoning you. This is why he'll always find something new to criticize you about, and ESPECIALLY why he's targeting *very specifically* the achievement you were feeling so good about - the fact that he specifically called out the pull-ups, a goal that you achieved and a reason you were feeling good about yourself, as the point when your ""new"" ugliness appeared... he knows exactly what the fuck he's doing.

Honestly, OP, I expect it's a blend of both. He's a misogynist shithead who feels he's entitled to women, and he's an abusive shithead who is blatantly breaking you down to try and make you feel like a) you can't do better than him b) you 'owe' him for 'settling' for you and c) anything that makes you feel good or proud or secure is actually bad.

If he was *really* concerned about having a skewed expectation of women due to porn and fraternity norms, that's HIS problem to solve via therapy. If he actually cared about anyone but himself, he would WANT to change this skewed perception that has caused him to repeatedly hurt someone he supposedly loves.

Because we're not able to talk about different shades of issues, people get labelled as ""extremists"" and then just succumb to it.

I think most people are probably like me in that they don't really care about Islam, but are happy to have Muslims in Canada despite some regressive characteristics that are part of any religion. Still, we all think that as long as it's not too bad, we can live with it. 

But let's say you want to speak out against face coverings because it perpetuates the notion that women are chattel or that they lack agency over their own sexuality; there are enough people out there of influence who label that ""extremist"" and then what?

You either shut up or take it as a challenge. 

It's like the ""Proud Redneck"" thing in the US South or conservative evangelicals becoming the absolute worst thing we say they are. At some point it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you can't have objective, moderated views that aren't black and white then you force people into one extreme or the other. And I think extremists count on that for force multiplication.

Take right-wing Nazis in the US. There probably are just a few thousand in the country, but they have an outsized voice because there are a lot of conservatives who have overlap with *some* of their views and it's better to caucus with them than with ""liberals"". 

Radicalisation and polarisation doesn't happen overnight and if you're a moderate, I think you need to assert that you can believe Islam has some features that are incompatible with a modern, secular Canada and not be shamed for it. And I think it goes without saying that it isn't just Islam, either. The Catholics ran Quebec like a theocracy for 300 years. That's the stuff we don't want to happen again. "	canada	canada	-1

To get to the point, you can't take control of another countries military presence unless you literally absorb said presence and units by absorbing their government. Obviously, no one is absorbing the US anytime soon.

Society another country has a military presence somewhere, your choices are to get them to remove it, wait for them to remove it, or eliminate it. As you stated, one would not want to invade the EU for their natural resources but their productivity and stability, both which would be eliminated following an invasion. So that third way of eliminating a military presence is out. 

So then there's just convincing or waiting, neither which involve an invasion. So your reasoning doesn't really line up. 

Now, are there actually other reasons to invade? Sure. Many. But that's not my point here. My point is only that you would not invade a country to control their presence, you'd invade a country to replace or eliminate someone else's military presence. "	worldnews	worldnews	-1

However, these don't apply to China, which has raised nearly a billion people out of absolute poverty in the last few decades, largely independently of these types of programs. 

And yet China's growth is routinely included in reports on poverty reduction. 

There's an excellent scholarly article called [The true extent of global poverty and hunger: questioning the good news narrative of the Millennium Development Goals](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01436597.2015.1109439) that breaks down how the MDGs have been subtly shifted since their inception to include more people, or to reduce the necessary threshold for calling someone ""poor"" while making it look like it's actually been raised.

EDIT: From the abstract (emphasis mine):

&gt; The MDGs have used targeted statistical manipulation to make it seem as though the poverty and hunger trends have been improving when in fact they have worsened. In addition, the MDGs use definitions of poverty and hunger that dramatically underestimate the scale likely of these problems. **In reality, around four billion people remain in poverty today, and around two billion remain hungry – more than ever before in history, and between two and four times what the UN would have us believe**. The implications of this reality are profound. Worsening poverty and hunger trends indicate that our present model of development is not working and needs to be fundamentally rethought.

I was on leave due to significant nerve damage in one arm, so the first 1.5 months was mostly spent at home due to severe pain and the haziness of combined sleep deprivation and constant pain meds. After that, I had all this time and found it very hard to fill.

I’d get up at a normal time, go spend a lot of time at the gym most days, and then come home and go “Ok, now what?”. I did a lot of hiking, I went on long drives, played all the video games I wanted, and read lots of books. I play the piano, and I was able to devote some time to that as well, and I had the cleanest car known to man thanks to lots of time spent detailing it to the degree that probably suggests obsessive tendencies. With all that, I was still left with a lot of free time. I was staying with my folks since I didn’t want to keep paying rent in the city where I went to school, so I would have maybe taken up some sort of time consuming hobby like woodworking but I couldn’t exactly set up shop in their garage. 

When you remove work from the equation, you are left with an amount of time to fill that is sort of hard to fathom until you’re in that situation. I would easily fill my time if I worked less than I do now, but doing that with no work at all is another story. "	science	science	-1
712	"I do appreciate your perspective and I don't know the conditions over there. I can only give my own anecdotes. 

My mom was a high school principal and teacher for 10 years. I can tell you she spent most of the school holidays doing full days at the office, the only difference was she got home a little earlier. During school days she rarely got home before 8pm and was very often still preparing teacher schedules and stuff like that at home. 

Granted part of that was because apparently her deputy principals were useless and she often had to take on a lot of their work. 

My girlfriend is a primary school teacher, she spends most of the holidays finishing marking, because it's not just ticking boxes - students need individual feedback and analysis on how they're doing in various areas. Now multiply that by like 200 students. Also on lesson planning for the next semester because god knows how they're expected to prepare lessons during the school period with everything else going on (remember they have to mark holiday homework when school starts again so they'll have no time). Also finishing paperwork for their department, attending conferences, dealing with parents etc. 

I'm not saying they don't have holidays, and by all means there are careers that have worse hours. And they can often do their work at home during this time, meaning that they do have some capacity to look after children. But the idea that being a teacher is less than a full time job because of school holidays is, in my opinion, absurd.

764	"&gt;Google builds a code for a reference device (Googe Nexus series, now Pixel series) and releases the code to open public and other companies make changes to the code based on their hardware and their requirement. Which company achieves a better software optimization? Google or third parties? 

The vast majority of Android code is agnostic of the hardware it's running on. You just make sure your hardware works against the completely open and longstanding API calls Android will make. It's a complete different layer of the stack. Customising for a given piece of hardware is primarily a Linux kernel level change, and the vast majority of the work is actually handled by the SoC vender - usually Qualcomm. The only time a vendor will really need to tweak Android is if they want to support hardware features that android itself doesn't yet support - for example the s pen or essential's notch before android P.

&gt;Plus, Samsung is forced into a position to add features in order to differentiate itself from other ocmpanies, which would inevitably make the system heavier and slower. 

This is just absolute nonsense. They aren't forced to add features at all. The vast majority of Android device makers don't feel the need to add unique features, they just make a well executed device for a great price. Samsung does this entirely by choice.

&gt;So they are not the same code. 

They aren't the same code *because Samsung feels the need to add an enormous amount of shite*. Its not in any way necessary. And to clarify, im not just talking about the user facing duplicate apps, nor even adding features such as the s pen. It's the MASSIVE and incredibly bloated framework in the background that they feel the need to add that really kills performance. They actively try to make their devices as non-standard as possible, adding fuckloads of worthless additional APIs in the hope developers make use of them, thus making the apps in question on work fully or even at all on Samsung devices.

Luckily they've completely failed in encouraging developers to make heavy use of their framework, but they bolt it all on to each phone regardless.

It's also worth noting that a lot of this additional code is flat out badly written. It's fundamentally laggy and bloated code. It takes far more ram than it should and requires far more CPU cycles. They simply are not good at writing software."

765	"Concepts like this, as well as having been involved in a short term successful and long term unsuccessful counterinsurgency strategy, are why I've always been fond of the old canard that war is simply 'failed diplomacy'.

I blame TV and movies and the PR departments for military services. We've all imbibed at the teat the idea that a batallion of Marines and a Navy SEAL team can fix anything. 

Or, if you are are American, the myth that Vietnam could have been won if only the government had let the military do its job. False. The military was being asked to do a job it wasn't suited for, and that's why it failed. 

If your only problem is 'these easily identifiable dudes in particular, right now', then a military can solve your problem. Any problem that can be solved by killing or improved by killing more can be solved by a military.

Unfortunately, many problems humans face as a species are not amenable to killing. Very few problems are, actually. It is perhaps a consequence of our evolutionary history that we view killing as a viable strategy: the successful hammer that makes all else appear to be a nail.

And finally, no military can offer a long term solution for any non-defensive problem. Either a problem scales with killing or it doesn't. You can kill poachers, sure, but that doesn't fix why people become poachers. 

Last aside: people in developing countries are not stupid and often have a sense of the patiently historical that ought to shame us. They see the erratic way the Westerners dive into and out of projects in other countries on a whim, driven by fits of charitable giving, momentary national security interest, and moral panics.

They know they can just wait us out. So sure, you can deploy death squads (or 'disincentive squads') to Africa, but it is fairly likely the locals will stop poaching for as long as we make it difficult and resume it as soon as our money/interest/presence wanes.

&gt; Further, I know from learning to drive that it's possible to get that type of ""moral anger"" at things that aren't immoral if they're convenient. Maybe that's just me. 

I don't have any analogous experience, sorry.

But it's impossible to generalize empirical observations, and you only think your faculties reach logical conclusions because your faculties tell you so.

Reasons for that are that he relies a lot more on athleticism to win than most other Euro prospects, and that athleticism is at best gonna be slightly above average by NBA standards once he reaches his prime, and that's if everything goes his way, and because you can hardly predict how his shooting is gonna translate to NBA because perimeter defenses work very differently in Europe and USA...

**However** you gotta realize that Doncic is playing in Spanish league (and Spanish cup as well I guess) and Euroleague... all of which offer waaay stronger of a competition than what Bargnani had both in Italian league and in Euroleague which was significantly weaker back then (seriously, Euroleague has improved **a lot** since 2005... It's not something you can quantify but I'd say it's at least twice as strong as it was during Bargnani's gig there).

Also, schedules these days are a lot tougher, European players now play a lot more games than they did back in '00s because the new Euroleague system is now set as league + postseason, while the previous one had a group stage and a knockout stage which meant that the weaker teams would usually just play several games before getting kicked out, or legit stop trying to win after getting their first two or three losses. This makes it easier to get a clear picture of players skill level because they now have to play at least 30 games in Euroleague against the best competition Europe has to offer, while back then you'd be basing your projections on a couple of those games and shitton of games against teams from their national leagues that would probably get crushed by most D-League teams.

edit - That last part about playing against trash team is one of the main reasons why so many European big men were getting too much hype for a while... It's already hard to find great big guys for the NBA (it feels like like even the most of star Cs and PFs have quite glaring weaknesses to their game), so it's even tougher in Europe... then it becomes quite a bit easier to dominate against all those back-to-the-basket 30 something dudes who've been playing on their teams because they can't find the adequate replacement for years.

US solar panels have made a lot of progress in the past few years.  Until recently, Chinese solar panels were more efficient and cheaper than US made ones.  I think the US finally caught up on efficiency but still has trouble competing on price.  The tariffs take away the competitive motivation to innovate and improve on tech/cost savings.

884	"""Dealing and selling of dangerous drugs should be a criminal act""

Currently we have many legal drugs that are very dangerous. Alcohol, tobacco, and even marijuana present many many risks to the user. These drugs are being regulated and sold by the government. All substances can be dangerous in some way or another, even water.

So you're saying that alcohol and tobacco should be illegal. Obviously this isn't going to happen as the majority of people would disagree to criminalizing it, even though it causes over 20x more deaths yearly vs most illegal drugs. 

For this reason we would be better off legalizing the drugs and helping people take them in a safer way. There's no negative effect from legalizing the drug. People won't stop using them even though they are illegal, as we can see, so we are better of regulating them and providing harm reduction practices for them to stay alive and safe.

""All supply routes of drugs that are illegal should be controlled by the government""

I agree, but this is not possible. If a drug is illegal people are gunna find a profit in prpducing it and selling it. The information on how to produce these drugs is to easily found. Anyone could produce heroin if they wanted to, which is why legalization would help. If you legalize a substance and regulate It, even maybe create facility's to administer it, you would be creating a safer way for users to have the correct doses, and eliminate the potential harms that the black market would bring such as lacing of other drugs and inaccurate doses. Users would rather know exactly what they are getting so they would always go to the regulated product over the black market.

"Getting married just to ""beat the clock"" on having kids is never a good idea honestly.  People raise kids solo all the time, but ideally you do it with someone you love.


Your ex has become fantasy for you.  By your own admission he doesn't want you (he left you) and you went into depression because of him.   You are delusional to harbor this much desire for him.


Your BF's being ""ok"" with this is just another red flag here.  Where lots of people would be like ""yeah no, that isn't cool"" he's ok with it.  He's ok with it because he's DESPERATE for kids - or some other reason you aren't aware of.  But where you both meet in desperation isn't love - it's more like companionship in that you both are pleased to find a ""workable"" situation.


Step 1 in all of this is you need to make peace with not being with your ex.  He doesn't love you and your affection/love/idolization of him is not only unhealthy, but a huge waste of time.  Only after you take that misplaced adoration away are you going to be able to sort your feelings out for your BF.

907	"&gt;And unfortunately, I can certainly say that I would never trust any government, no matter its leadership or make-up, with that level of control over such an important issue.

You literally said you will never support gun control, because the government might take it too far; that's a slippery slope argument. If you can't even imagine a situation that you change your stance on, then you're not asking for a debate, you're asking to argue pointlessly. Fine.

What are you looking for me to say? That you're raising legitimate points? You are. Am I calling for a nationwide gun ban? No, because I'm not stupid. The US is obviously too large to adopt that method, and aside from that, no, the government shouldn't take everyone's guns. But the current system is not sustainable, and that price of freedom is too damn high. Which is why I am in favor of better gun control measures being worked out and discussed at both state and federal levels.

Specifically I'm in favor of making it more difficult to get a gun in the first place. That includes things like psychological screenings, which you've already addressed some legitimate points on. Banning all people with certain mental illnesses is no better than profiling, so it would need to be prevented, probably best by allowing an appeal/second opinion to be had, but that opens the door for messed up people to just see psychologist after psychologist until they get a green light, which is frankly too expensive for the common person, but not an abject impossibility. It's a pretty expensive loophole, but a loophole nonetheless. Honestly not sure how to fully prevent it. I guess I'll keep thinking.

Criminals being banned from legally obtaining weapons: convicted felons lose voting rights for 2 years after they are released. Maybe a similar system there? Voting is a fundamental right, just like the right to bear arms. Or maybe people just shouldn't commit crimes if they want to have all their rights? That's the exchange when they get sent to jail, so I'm pretty sure losing the right to a firearm is a reasonable punishment, for a variety of offenses. Not all of them, of course, but definitely a few. I can already hear ""but what about the wrongfully convicted"", well then we should also be calling for reform to the judicial system, but that's a different issue that isn't even remotely able to be addressed through gun control.

Criminals illegally obtaining guns/Usage of miscellaneous weapons: that's part of why controls need to be implemented - to prevent more guns from being out there to be obtained by illegal means. This is particularly important regarding gangs, like you said. And even if we can prevent the gangs from getting guns, what's to stop them from using a machete, or a baseball bat? But then again, everyday people commit murder with miscellaneous objects or even their bare hands. If a gang wants to hurt you, then a gang is probably going to hurt you. So gun control won't impact gang violence too much. But it does prevent OVERALL gun violence, which is the point; you can't just say it doesn't solve this one problem and therefore any and all benefits of policy are moot. 

As for implementing better training as you've suggested, that'll be great for anyone who owns a gun and happens to be at the scene when something does go wrong. It's a situation that's happened before and is a legitimate to defend as a possible resolution to catastrophes. In that same vein, though, there are plenty of times when having a gun doesn't/wouldn't help a victim. Like Las Vegas, where there was no way for any of those victims to retaliate against the shooter. To be clear, I'm not against required training since it should also help prevent accidents involving guns in addition to being a great addition to the situations I mentioned above, but it's not a preventative measure against intentional misuse of a firearm.

Also I want to bring up a few additional points you mention:

&gt;There is no fucking up with this. There is no ‘well, shit, sorry we didn’t see that one coming’ and just hoping the mass societal issue a policy could generate will be ‘solved over time’

So without gun control, hundreds and hundreds of civilian deaths are the price of freedom, but with gun control the possible policy flaws are unforgivable sins?

&gt;The purpose of having a representative government rather than a direct democracy is because we need to have thought-out, reasonable, objectively considered, and debated legislation.

Yet you don't trust those same representatives to maintain your rights once even minor restrictions are in place. 

&gt;Once this threshold is crossed, there won’t be any going back, government never cede that level of legal precedent when it comes to political control. 

You're simultaneously saying that confiscation and a nationwide ban are both impossible to implement and the only logical outcome. You also say that revolution is a point of great concern regarding the right to bear arms. It's what the second amendment was for, right? Then shouldn't you be revolting against the government if they do cross the line? It's the price of freedom.

&gt; So yes, it better be the best, most thought out policy there is, because this is a serious issue we cannot afford to misstep on.

Awesome, I'm not saying it shouldn't be thought out for a long time, hence my call for everyone to be part of the process instead of being like you and trying to prevent the process from happening at all. You're not helping."	"Meanwhile in the UK...

I'm thinking it will simplify my tax filings - set up IUP to automatically charge my business Amex every month, and then instead of having to do the depreciation sheet on each return I can just itemize those specific payments on the return of the year in which they occur and be done with it.

Initially it was assumed to be just about our knowledge, but actually it is also aout reality. Reality cannot have the exact position.

The uncertainty principle applies to really many things, not just location. I would assume that it applies to existence too.

The problem is that it is difficult to find a good analogy for these, because on large scale things work differently.



"	"&gt;It is my perspective then, that if an unborn child has the mental capacity of cockroach, why would we value them any more? We should measure their mental capacity, and compare it to other creatures, and judge accordingly.

Well, it's just not that simple. Mental capacity is certainly not the only metric by which we value life. Nor is there any present evidence of alien life, so let's discard that for now. If this is the case, do you find it moral then to not value the lives of retards? Those who have mental deficiencies? How about newly born infants? Should we not bat an eye at those who find it moral to discard them?

&gt;While I expect it does feel wrong to get an abortion, I view this as biological side-effects stemming from empathy.

It's wrong regardless of any 'feeling' as far as any logical path I have come across. Empathy supporting or not supporting a reason for doing something has nothing to do with it being right or wrong, so that I agree with. Although to make a point of it, empathy is generally correlated with correct moral choices, then the opposite. So the whole mentioning of biological feeling of empathy associated with abortion just seems strange to include.

Furthermore, the question with abortion isn't ""do we value x life over y life"", this is an absurd question with regards to determining if ""x"" has value. The question is, is it moral to kill an unborn child, does its life (x) have value inherently? To which, outside of exceedingly rare exceptions and absurd rationalizations, it's pretty obvious to me that the answer is that it does have value and it is wrong.

There is no evidence to suggest in any definitive way the 'personhood' of an unborn child. They have their own unique D.N.A. and are living and breathing. Does the nervous system and full development of the brain become the determining interval of personhood? Maybe, but probably not. While a threshold exists, it's not entirely obvious where that threshold lies. There is no evidence any which way to confirm. And so the situation is ambiguous. Ambiguity favors what's intuitively true, and even if you don't accept that intuitive truth, ambiguity itself rationally favors pro-life. Imagine a man beating to death a living, human size creature under a blanket, imagine the absurdity of such a scenario in which the police approach and ask ""is that a human being under there?!"", to which the man replies ""I don't know!"", as he continues beating away. Maybe a case could be made if pregnancy was some one to one life trade (their life versus mine), but not only is this not the case, but even then it's a dubious proposition, considering the person, exempting rare circumstances, is fully responsible for being pregnant in the first place. 

It also just reeks of hypocrisy really, that the same ideological movement that approves abortion is generally correlated with being ""unable"" to differentiate between objective lines, crying subjectivity and that matters are not black and white at every turn. But when it comes to abortion, suddenly the perception of complexity and ambiguity in determining something isn't a value they hold any more. So then it seems reasonable then it being nothing more than further symptoms of the lefts futile attempt to rationalize something clearly abhorrent for more of the same attraction to avoidance of responsibility and selfish indulgence."

Packing is way bigger than seals are, which means it's bulky and expensive but also that it's extremely resistant to ingress.  The sealing is pretty distributed over a large area so if grit gets in, it doesn't get pressed very hard into the shaft.  The packing can also compensate for wear for a long time since it is constantly pushed tighter and tighter against the shaft.  

Elastomer seals also require really high quality polishes on the shaft.  They aren't great at handling pits or scratches since the sealing area is fairly small.  This is a problem when it's impractical to refinish the shaft- like the 3' main shaft in a cargo ship.  Also, stuffing can sometimes be applied around a shaft rather than from the end.  The cost of doing that in many cases is not insignificant.

982	"Very long time raid/guild leader, from their inception into GW2

Here are a few questions:

how do you deal with always one or two member missing on a scheduled raid night ? Do you have more than ten members and you have them sit out ? If you do that, do you see members dropping out of the guild ?

- Typically yes on the extra members. There are static slots and there are swing slots, often called ""+1"". If a static member cant make it, they should generally let you know ahead of time if literally at all possible (this isnt raid etiquette, this is life etiquette) which gives you a chance to go down your list of preferred stand-ins and fill the slot. If literally nobody is available, grab a Pug and hope for the best. I personally have not seen anyone drop the guild due to this. 

how have you recruited people so that they stay together and keep playing together ?

Start with friends and players you already know, who are going to hang out regardless of the raid status. After that, my personal strategy for recruitment is  a reference to the previous point; those Pugs you pick up now and then? Make an offer to the chill ones that contribute well - they'd probably love to stop pugging so often.

how have you overcome burn outs from certain members ?

This is what swings/+1's are for. If someone gets burnt out to the degree that they have literally no interest in raiding anymore, even just logging on once a week for a couple hours, there's nothing you as a leader can do about it. have a conversation with them, let them know in friendly but certain terms that if its going to be a long-term thing you need to offer the main slot to someone else. That said, I have a lot of +1's that are only fine being +1's and dont WANT a static committed slot, so I've subbed people for 2-3 weeks before and then had them come back in once their IRL business was handled.

raids can get frustrating, how have you dealt with toxicity, fights, arguments ?

- A good idea here is to start with people who arent natively toxic. If you start with inherently toxic people, you're going to have a bad time. Once past that, dont slam your head on something over and over again unless its for progression. Set a pull limit (say 5 attempts at a boss) before just shrugging and moving on to the next wing, unless its your last thing for the night. Never make this a big deal, teach dont berate, everyone has off nights. Try to end on a good note, even if you've been wiping on your 5th boss for an hour, by pointing out what went well and highlight progress made throughout the night. Did you go from consistently dying at 80% to consistently dying at 50%? that's good work, that's progress.

As for fights and toxicity, maybe I'm a little unorthodox in this, but... this is your team and your guild. You make the calls and decisions, and any input you seek is simply in the form of advise or opinion seeking - the say is yours. This is not in any way a democracy, and as long as you treat people like civil adults, they can agree or disagree with you all they want as long as they do it.

what would you say are the main tips to maintain a successful raid group ?

1) start with chill people who you know. A chill baseline will do you wonders in the long-term
2) be civil, even when you want to strangle the shit out of someone
3) dont call people out. If someone is fucking up repeatedly, whisper them and explain what's killing them or how they can do a thing better. If needed, swap the roles out.
4) be consistent
5) Teach, dont berate
6) get yoself a discord. Shit's free, and its a great way to stay high on communication."	"There's a scaling dungeon system similar to Mythic+ (Fractals), and there are some raids. Not as robust as WoW but they are there if you are looking for regular group content. 

Aside from that your PvE endgame is working towards a legendary/cosmetics or whatever new story and map content there is (usually includes some kind of cosmetic item to farm for). Long term would be outfitting multiple classes.

What GW2 offers is relaxed gear progression with free content updates if you log in for each Living Story episode. I play and like GW2 when I need a break from WoW and I never have to ""catch up"" gear-wise, but it would never replace WoW as a main MMO for me.

I think in actual fact people use the term 'free will' for this black box (because it's expedient for assigning moral responsibility onto others) without knowing or thinking too much about what exactly goes on inside it.  

  I'm an incompatibilist because I really fail to see what could possibly be in the box that provides the qualities that define free will, that would make an individual in some fundamental way the ultimate source of their actions."

1016	"&gt;“Prisons were made for men, and they are made to traumatize,” said Celia Colon, who teared up after sharing with the group her history of abuse. “They were not made for healing.”

Traumatizing men is perfectly acceptable. Traumatizing women (who got to prison by traumatizing others) is not acceptable because...women are equal to men?

&gt;“Prison is not where women need to be,” said Benedict, a partner on the National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women, funded by the U.S. Department of Justice. “Even if prisons were highly functional places, they don’t belong there. It’s a train wreck, to be honest, a train wreck.”

If women commit felonies, then prison is exactly where they need to be. As a matter of fact, women commit felonies and gynocentric judges and prosecutors often REFUSE to send them to prison.

&gt;Margaret Byrne, an attorney who for 35 years has represented countless women who fought back against abusers, agreed. Many women call 911 to report the violent crime they’ve just committed on a partner, Byrne said, but they fail at proving the difficult self-defense theory in court.

Probably because you can't 'self-defense' a man while he's sleeping, or when his back is turned, or when he's not presenting an immediate and credible threat.

&gt;By the time she was 16 and living in South Chicago, Colon had drifted into gang life, drawn by its offer of support — and guns for protection.

&gt;“I saw a lot of hurt and bloodshed,” Colon, 42, told the other women gathered at the first meeting. “Things that are never gonna be erased. It does irreversible damage.”

You mean you validated cholos and gangbangers by giving them pussy.

Those who insist that they cannot be held responsible for their own actions, that they are merely leaves floating along the winds of economic circumstances, or are victims of societal programming, should not enjoy the right to affect or influence public policy or the use of public money. "	"&gt;The social problems we do have are caused by the abandonment of individual responsibility. No one is ever at fault for their own problems and no one has the power to improve their own circumstances. This is the ideology of today's Western society.

Why would someone need to take responsibility when the modern-leftists will gladly solve your problems for you? Also personal responsibility is difficult and full of unknowns, which is scary. People would much rather be comfortable in their echo-chambers of conformity rather than face reality. This seems to be the US democratic platform over the last 8 years or so.

I honestly think this is in part due to social media. We can very easily build ourselves into these echo-chambers with next to no effort; find a group, build a friends list, purge anyone who disagrees. The image nails it perfectly with trying to encourage the face-to-face discussions.

1024	"Going exclusive with EA doesn't necessarily mean less sales though. For example, if the NFL gave out their license to anybody willing to make an NFL game, would it mean a significant increase in sales of NFL games? I think the likely case is that the sales would simply split.

Star Wars is different because there's a higher likelihood of fans buying multiple games. Still, how many Star Wars games does Disney want to make? Unless it's a really large number, EA should be capable of developing a reasonable amount of Star Wars games. Again, they aren't necessarily selling less. At the very least it's not guaranteed.

Going exclusive with Xbox/Windows 10 is different. It's an absolute guarantee that sales would drop without Playstation. Unless Xbox takes over the market to the extent that lost Playstation sales don't matter. And that would take many years, if it ever happens.

And another point. These companies want to fans to have access to their products. They want their fans to be happy. Partnering with EA has allowed them to do that because EA develops AAA games for every platform people expect to be able to play those games. If they go exclusive to Xbox/Windows 10 then suddenly Star Wars, NFL, and FIFA fans with just a PS4 (a large amount of people) would be pissed. These companies usually try to avoid pissing off fans.

It simply doesn't make sense for these companies to give exclusive rights to EA if Microsoft buys them. I doubt any of them would have made their deals with EA if they were owned by Microsoft and only making Xbox/Windows 10 exclusives. Just like I would never expect any of them to give exclusive rights to Sony or Nintendo."	No, it's not at all. Most games do a type of handshake where simply the game clients' movement and actions are sent to the server and the server confirms if it was a hit/miss for example. Your client won't know until the server sends back a confirmation, at which point your client either assumed the next position or syncs back to what the server told you. You don't want to give trust to the client as it opens up for a lot of easy cheating. On the other hand for games where it's mostly about CoOp and cheating doesn't matter, you can do a lot more calculations client-side so each player kind of lives in their own world and instead syncs each state with one another asynchronously, or parallel to your own gameplay. It may result in your teammate taking damage visually when nothing hitting him on your screen, but at least the feeling of lag is heavily diminished since hitboxes can be calculated locally entirely. Netcode is an interesting topic and handled in many different ways. Dying when behind cover in Battlefield will never not rustle my jimmies.

One of the more prominent ones that is always being discussed is the possibility that Zeke was turned into a spy by Eren Kruger and that he is currently working to liberate Eldians. These theories often provide good evidence for this, but none seem to ever discuss the fact that **Zeke's inner monologue demonstrated so much hatred for Paradis Eldians** as he showered the Survey Corps with boulders during the Return to Shiganshina arc.

**Zeke's inner monologue is the best insight we can get as to what he's truly planning behind the scenes.** Often times theories will state ""Zeke said X to Y person, meaning he's planning Z plan."" The thing is, these could all just be lies. 

**We've seen Zeke interact with Marleyans, who would immediately stomp on his plans if they got any hint that he was not the loyal, obedient kid wonder they think he is.** Of course, Zeke won't mention what he's truly up to around them. He'll put up a facade. ""Loyal boy wonder here to serve Marley.""

**Literally, we've only ever seen Zeke interact with two groups of people, the second group being the Eldian Warriors who can relate to how it feels to be an Eldian.** These warriors, however, could also be the loyal-to-Marley type to rat him out in a heartbeat if they get the sense that he's not the loyal, obedient kid wonder they think he is. Of course he'd never say anything to raise their suspicions. He'd never let them get a glimpse as to what is going on in his mind.

**His inner monologue however is a true insight as to how he feels and what he thinks of society, particularly Paradis Eldians.** We're shown a glimpse into his thought process, free from restrictions and fake acts he has to put on around pretty much every single person ever.

If Zeke was turned into a spy by Kruger in order to serve Eldia, *why does he hate Walldians so much?*

  Could it be that someone as smart as Zeke truly did buy into the ""Marleyan Eldians good, Walldians bad"" propaganda and is only working for Marleyan Eldians?

"I am somebody who I am sure you would consider a leftist (I hate Jordan Peterson and I am always happy to see him getting kicked off of college campuses by students). Yeah - it's an insult. Or at least, it's an American term (I mean that it is popular right now due to America) in vogue due to Donald Trump which I would never self apply.

I would think it would be obvious to you, but I don't consider my political motivations to be anything remotely close to ""ah yes - no more free speech and while we're at it, let's destroy the economy!""

Total and complete freedom of speech (like allowing Nazis to openly run around spreading propaganda with the idea that you can't censor any ideas because bad people might get into power and censor the wrong ideas) is an American thing. I - and I'm sure most people who you think are ""working to suppress free speech"" am not against freedom of speech. I do, however, think that there are points at which it needs to be limited. Hence why we have hate speech laws in Canada which are protected under section 1 of the Charter.

&gt;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such *reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society*.

Frankly I think most of the people you're talking about think it is a waste of time and energy for us to be trying to talk down nazis and white supremacists when nothing productive is ever going to come out of it, and the only possible outcome is ignorant people latching onto said people's dumb xenophobic ideas and running with them.

None of that applies to Jordan Peterson, of course - he's just a dick and I have no problem seeing other people be dicks right back to him. I think it's a huge joke to talk about that as if his freedom of speech is being violated. Can you go online and in all the major papers and read about him? Yes? I think he's got plenty of voice, then.

Plus the people you hear about who are cutting off his speeches are like 18 years old and, like all 18 year olds (hey baby boomers, what were you doing at age 18, huh?) tend to go a little bit over the top in their actions because they are just finding their voice and forming opinions. So it's really ridiculous how people talk about this like it's some giant downfall of free speech. I went to university from 2011 to 2016 and never once saw one prof or student get shut down for being offensive. I did, on the other hand, see half a class straight up walk out on a first class when they found out it was going to be focused on indigenous issues. Universities are still archaic and tied to a really old school, Eurocentric worldview. It's a huge joke to act like the right wing doesn't have plenty of power in them.

The people being upset by this stuff are the same people who don't understand that ""politically correct"" is basically a shorter way of saying ""not openly being a dick to minorities"". It's so laughable to me when I see old white guys blathering about how the world is ending because they can't make mean spirited jokes about gay people or trans people or whatever minority they feel like being a dick to.

Or people who get all riled up about having to actually treat First Nations people and customs with respect. Same thing. That gets filed under ""forced political correctness"" by people when it's actually ""not being a complete dick for no reason"".

Same thing with people acting like millennials are precious little snowflakes for caring about respecting non-binary people who don't want to identify as he/she. Who gives a fuck? Why get all up in arms about it like a dick when you can just treat people the way they want to be treated (creating a more diverse and interesting society in the process)?  If somebody wants to identify as male or female or ""they"" or something just call them that and stop whining so much.

Right, but who is to say every point of connection is a positive influence? There's a reason this post contained the disclaimer:

&gt;WARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide

Pre-2000s maybe we looked around and thought, *everyone around me seems less down than I am in general, I should figure out what is going on and try to work out of this funk...*


But then you got on 4chan the first time and discovered that there's an epidemic. Now maybe there's less motivation to work on the issues leading to ideation/depression because previously they seemed like barriers to connection but in a digital setting everything no matter how grim or bad is a means of connecting with others. 


If you feel isolated, maybe the internet is an enabler. Maybe someone who is depressed and seeking human connection cannot bring themselves to work on the one thing that allows them to keep connecting with others (so they think), suicidal depression. So instead of thinking of it as an illness, it becomes an identity.


That is the premise of my question, maybe using technology to connect humanity absolutely to whatever end is not a good thing. Maybe we need to become aware that just because you are one way and can find others that are the same way, does not make it healthy to be hate posting over at /r/The_Donald or /b/ while loathing in suicidal depression. That's all technically what you are describing, connecting with others, but without the things that traditionally govern healthy interaction such as social normative behavior, cultural values, empathy etc. all of that gets removed online and re-created via systems like Reddit's mod/karma system, but its far from human...

I am going to argue fervently that in the general case of connected technology the end did not justify the means. For every positive interaction via the internet there are a dozen that are purely cancerous. And I think the socio-political climate in America repute with hate speech, racist political leadership, fake news etc. is the case study, enabled at least in part, by facilitating and empowering the wrong types of connections. Another case in point is the flat earth/anti-vax movements. Those are only possible via connected technology that allow disparate collections of mental illness to self-validate and organize.

1048	This is one reason why USENET has its good sides despite being very old technologically, since the way it works is that every newsgroup offered by USENET servers is replicated on those servers in its entirety (although message retention times can vary). Plus honouring message deletion messages is voluntary so not nearly every server will do it, meaning that if you posted something in a reasonably popular newsgroup, it will potentially end up being replicated on dozens (or hundreds in the past) of fully independent servers all over the world with no way of deleting or altering it on all of those afterward - which is how currently Google has fairly large USENET archive going back all the way to 1985 or so, since only one of those servers would need to have a working backup of a newsgroup to save it.

As for culture, that's easy. Cultures can split off in a couple generations, or even in just a few years, of separation."	"Before we begin, let us establish the proper framework to look at matrices:
Matrices represent linear transformations.  A transformation is like a machine that takes in objects (vectors) and spits out other objects of the same type (vectors).  Linear transformations are special transformations, in that if you have a shape and you draw lines from the origin outward that have tick marks at regular intervals, a linear transformation will keep those lines straight and the distance between tick marks the same.  This means the only operations you can really do are scaling and rotating line relative to the origin.

Now, when you send something through a matrix, some times you want to know how they change the size of objects you put in.  One way to look at this is if you have a hypercube made of unit vectors on the axes, what is the resultant volume of the hypercube after you put it in the linear transformation.  Now, recall that these transformations can only rotate and scale things evenly.  Pure rotation is not captured by the determinant.  Only the scaling (for your own exercise, try plugging in a rotation matrix).  Also, because things are scaled evenly, the scaling factor on this hypercube stays the same even if you take smaller cubes.  Furthermore, if you have shape that are nice enough, you can make a pixelated shape from cubes that all get scaled basically the same way.  So this does a good job at capturing the change in side the transformation does.  In geometric terms, this is what the determinant is.

Now that we kinda have this, we can start assigning this ""size"" measure to matrices.  This is why we can see them in limits or other calculations, as they in a sense represent the size of the matrix.  There are other ways, of course, to assign a size to the matrix, but the determinant is one of them.

In the field of vector calculus, we like using determinants because the things we look at are nice and generally differentiable.  Differentiability means that locally, your function/transformation is linear.  If you zoom into X^2,  you will realize that it looks very similar to a line with a slope of 2x.  Understanding that you are using linear transformations to approximate functions is one of the main ideas of calculus.  Now, it would be helpful to understand how this changes things in a small, specific area.  If they are nice functions/transformations, I can locally represent this as a linear transformation (and if it is finite dimensional in euclidean space, this is a matrix).  The determinant will allow you to calculate the change in size this local area will do to you.  

Now, one more note is that determinants can be done basis-free and a very interesting general definition.  However, I think that is a discussion for another time.

If there are 100 people who are negative, the precision increases to almost 99% (1% chance of being innocent, compared to 0.02% if the FPR were 2% instead.) That's better than you can get with evidence in most simple cases. It's still huge, but the background rate (the prior) modulates it.

The problem is, the majority of people are usually innocent.

Yup it bothers me too that brands are getting away with selling poor quality stuff just because it has their name stitched on it, with many of the perception Factory inventory is equivalent to mainline.

However, the market will course-correct. These brands abusing factory/outlet branding will learn the hard way what consumers are going to think of their products in the long-run.

Increasingly you have to rely on tribal knowledge and whatever you can puzzle out of WWDC slide decks rather than the actual docs. Sometimes it's an issue of sparsity, sometimes it's an issue of basic things being omitted or presented at such a high level that you have to experiment to figure out basic issues, other times the docs are wrong. 

Case in point: the CoreAudio docs were never amazing, but they were adequate if not always up to date. I'm having a really tough time figuring out some fundamental things about AVAudioEngine. Which is a shame, because it is a really great framework if you can get it to do what you want it to do. (Anyone realize there's now a supported minimum phase resampling algorithm? Good luck finding any docs about it.

It is not harder to pause a PC than a console. That's just dumb.

And a PC can be hooked up to a TV and used for couch gaming exactly like a console.

Those are not benefits of consoles, they are benefits of ""I put this machine in my lounge-room"".

The benefits of consoles are ease of use, and price. They didn't reference ease of use at all, and they made it sound like PCs are incapable of being used with a TV. Yeah, people are gonna discuss why that isn't really correct...

I can't see a single post nit-picking their reference to the pricing advantage, because that's a fair point to give the console. People are just discussing the other points that don't seem like fair points to make...

When I first built my PC, all I had to do was put it right next to my PS4, and swap over the HDMI. I could use the same PS4 controllers, on the same games (aside from exclusives), using the same TV, sitting on the same couch.

Same Deal if I take the PC to someone's house, all I need to do is swap over the HDMI from their console to my PC, and we are up and running with PC Couch gaming.

Of the few people I know who have a gaming PC, they all use it in the exact same way as they used their console - they just swapped out the console for a PC.

I'm not trying to downplay consoles, they are still great for gaming on, and the ease of use is a major, *major* plus (goddamn can PC get frustrating with driver issues and firmware updates and whatnot), but the positives this person put forth as if they were an inherent benefit of consoles just doesn't fly...

I’m not a professional or educated, just an interested civilian :)	"I've been on nights for 12 years. There are definitely consequences for not maintaining strict sleep/ eat discipline. As long as I sleep the same time every day, I'll get about 8 hours of sleep and feel perfectly fine. However, if i sleep like a day-walker on the weekends, I'll feel like garbage the next week. This schedule takes a couple weeks to get used to as well, So a 3-day study is virtually pointless. 

 Some tricks I've learned over the years;

1. Don't revert back to a 1st shift sleep schedule on the weekends (very difficult some times, especially with family) 
This is really the big one, everyone I know that burns out on third does this.

2. Don't eat for 4 hours before bed- time, though i'm not sure why this helps you sleep better. 

3. Kick caffeine completely. Often times 3rd shifters become so reliant  on caffeine, that it starts to impact their sleep

4. Go out in the sun as often as possible. I take a vitamin d supplement when I can't get any sunlight (you can keep your ""vitamins are useless"" comments. It works for me, even if its psychosomatic) 

5. Find or create a quiet, dark, cool place to sleep.
 A little cold with some white noise, seems to be the consensus among my peers (about 250 people in manufacturing setting) 

6. Make sure the people around you understand the need to respect your sleep,  especially spouses and kids. 

7. DO NOT DISTURB. This is a function on your cell phone. If you don't know what it is, look it up and thank me later. Highly customizable and a godsend for night shift workers (I have a galaxy s9, can't really comment on other brands) "	science	science	-1

You are right about dieting too. Keep very hydrated because when I was done with sessions my clothes would add a whopping 2-3 lbs because of all the sweat (gym was always warm which made it worse).

The biggest thing in my opinion was cutting out the garbage from my diet (pizza, Chinese food, fried buffalo wings, beer/soda, potato chips, etc.). I took my diet to the extreme at first by limiting myself to &lt;1500 calories made up of as much protein as possible and no carbs + biking. You WILL feel like absolute shit if you do that, but I was dumb and thought “less calories is more weight loss, right?” It was a big mistake I’ve learned from. 

so I’d advise cutting out as much sugar as possible, limiting carbs, incorporating a lot of greens, and having lots of smart snacks. I realized it was more expensive to eat healthy but it’s for your health. One of my favorites was venison jerky which is extremely lean, delicious, and a very easy snack.

EDIT: also, longer sessions have a compounded effect of after burn. Keeping my heart rate that high for that long while drinking loads of water (1-2 gallons a day depending on how much I worked out.

&gt; The story of how charr tribune Rytlock Brimstone became the first revenant hasn’t yet been told, but at the launch of Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns, he’ll have brought the knowledge of how to obtain that power to the world of Tyria, making it somewhat common knowledge.  

To me it would've been cleaner lorewise if Rytlock had instead been the first *herald*. The writers could've just retroactively explained that revenants always existed in Tyria in some form but were rare, which is why we never met them in core Tyria before HoT (unless we count the player character becoming one of them in core storyline retroactively).

And even if our heroes were aware of revenants to some extent, Rox's comment mentioning Rytlock's new abilities would still work under this scenario as Rytlock notably used the Legendary Dragon Stance of a herald in the cutscene depicting his return from the Mists."

Taboos can be dangerous. Not talking or downplaying leaved people isolated, give them no frame of reference and no peer support..   
And.. idk, I dont think explaining that one dose practice BDSM in which way whatever doesnt have to mean talking about sex techniques.
Nor dies it mean overwhelming someone unasked.

Hello everyone!
I'm a little confused on my first build.

I have a 570X case, with 6 LL120 fans and I'm using an h150i pro on the front. I've never done this before so please bear with me.

Ok, I installed the aio and replaced the stock fans on the front of the case with 3 of the LL fans. So now the fans need to hook up to the RGB hub and the CPU cooler, right? So I run the cables to the back of the case and hook them up with no issue. My issue comes to me in a few ways though. Fan 4, 5 and 6 also have two cable's connected to each fan, one goes to the RGB hub. But where does the other cable go? I don't know where they connect. I have seen many tutorials around the internet, but no one really says what to do or where to plug in the case fans...

Right, so if I set up the RGB to change color with the temps... will only the ones connected with the CPU cooler work?

I can post full specs if it's needed. But I don't really think it matters because this is about the case, cooler and fans.

Thanks for any help

1206	"My view is that Christian are no long bound by the civil and ceremonial law of the Jews, but we are still bound by the moral laws of which the 10 commandments are part.  But we all know we are incapable of fulfilling even all of that and this is where Jesus is significant.  By accepting Him as our savior and believing God raised Him from the dead, we are saved.  In being saved, we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit which dwells within and begins changing us into better people - which is the born again part.  We grow in spiritual maturity and outwardly, our behavior will change with the fruits of the spirit which are love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  Being a Christian and getting better is a process and we will never perfect it, but with the help of the Holy Spirit, we will improve.

There is also a difference in what saves us as Christians vs what saved Jews.  To be made righteous under the law, a person had to not break any of the moral law.  If they did, they had to offer a sacrifice to atone for the laws they broke.  Jesus was the last sacrifice and all who believe in Him receive His righteousness.

A minister who I have great respect for once said, ""you are saved, not because you do good works, but you do good works because you are saved.""

The civil law goes away because those were laws to govern the country of Israel and Christianity is given to all nations, not just the Jews.  The ceremonial laws go away because Jesus was critical of the Jewish leaders for following ceremony with intense rigor, but with no real love of God behind them.  He denounced tradition and ceremony as voiding the word of God.

The character of God from the Gen to Rev is all about loving Him and He loving us.  To recognize that with Him, we can accomplish anything, but without Him we were limited.  He expressed the desire to have a relationship with Him as a two way street...move closer to God and God will move closer to you.

1207	"As an addendum to all of this, if you really are trying to control your drift/position in the ocean, you can always drop a [sea anchor.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_anchor)

Think of it like a parachute that catches the water around you. If you try to go anywhere, the parachute fills with water and drastically increases your drag.

Fun fact, in the days of big sailing ships, if they had no wind available they would do [""warping"" or ""kedging"".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warping_(sailing\)) What you'd do is load up your sea anchor in some longboats, have the men paddle it in the direction you wanted to go, push it overboard and let it 'inflate'. Then, much like in winching a car, you had another group of longboats go to the midway point on the line, attach another line at that spot, and then they would paddle perpendicularly to the direction of the line. The result is that the force of your paddling was multiplied through the 'lever arm' of the sea anchor's line, and you could pull your huge ship forward some distance.

I can't recall the specific battle, but there was an incident once where an American warship was fighting a European one (uncertain if British or French or someone else, been a while) near Africa if I recall. The American ship wanted to disengage, but at some point in the battle the wind died down to nothing. The American captain, quick thinking, immediately had his men deploy for kedging. After a few minutes of this the enemy captain quickly followed suit. The result was that two modern warships were being towed VEEEERRYYYY SLOWWWWWLYYYY through battle with each other over the course of like 6-8 hours. I seem to recall that the ships were JUST close enough for the bow/stern guns to bother shooting at each other, but I could be wrong on that point.

The end result was after all this time the enemy captain said ""Screw this, I don't want him THAT much."" and disengaged.

Ugh, this question is so good and such a challenge. I think it depends on the location and resources available to the person stuck in the culture. In the US, there are plenty of programs that can assist people to leave these situations (if they want) or figure out how to change them/cope with them. If  the person is stuck in a location without resources and/or not willing or able to leave, then an option is to work at re-interpreting the abusive treatment. In other words, for the abused person to learn how to avoid taking on any ideas about ""deserving"" the beating or scolding. For the abused person to figure out how to work within the abusive system they are stuck in but not allow the abuse to take control of their mind and interpretations of self or situation. A great book (IMO) that comes to mind about this concept is Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning.

1216	"&gt; Things that might otherwise stigmatize and isolate people have become points of connection online.

Right, but who is to say every point of connection is a positive influence? There's a reason this post contained the disclaimer:

&gt;WARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide

Pre-2000s maybe we looked around and thought, *everyone around me seems less down than I am in general, I should figure out what is going on and try to work out of this funk...*


But then you got on 4chan the first time and discovered that there's an epidemic. Now maybe there's less motivation to work on the issues leading to ideation/depression because previously they seemed like barriers to connection but in a digital setting everything no matter how grim or bad is a means of connecting with others. 


If you feel isolated, maybe the internet is an enabler. Maybe someone who is depressed and seeking human connection cannot bring themselves to work on the one thing that allows them to keep connecting with others (so they think), suicidal depression. So instead of thinking of it as an illness, it becomes an identity.


That is the premise of my question, maybe using technology to connect humanity absolutely to whatever end is not a good thing. Maybe we need to become aware that just because you are one way and can find others that are the same way, does not make it healthy to be hate posting over at /r/The_Donald or /b/ while loathing in suicidal depression. That's all technically what you are describing, connecting with others, but without the things that traditionally govern healthy interaction such as social normative behavior, cultural values, empathy etc. all of that gets removed online and re-created via systems like Reddit's mod/karma system, but its far from human...

I am going to argue fervently that in the general case of connected technology the end did not justify the means. For every positive interaction via the internet there are a dozen that are purely cancerous. And I think the socio-political climate in America repute with hate speech, racist political leadership, fake news etc. is the case study, enabled at least in part, by facilitating and empowering the wrong types of connections. Another case in point is the flat earth/anti-vax movements. Those are only possible via connected technology that allow disparate collections of mental illness to self-validate and organize.

Also contributing to Western thought, in ancient times and then in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance onwards, a tradition of rationalism in various spheres of life, developed by Hellenistic philosophy, Scholasticism, humanism, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.

What makes you think this is any more concrete proof that it's easier to go masters-&gt;GM vs being harder to go diamond-&gt;masters?

Either one of those scenarios would result in the same statistical anomaly of a smaller % in masters compared to % in GM

The people struggling to hold onto low masters are nothing close to the people pushing towards GM, and a difference in the difficulty for those low masters/diamond players would skew this statistic exactly the same as the high masters/GM players. Actually even moreso, since there are more low masters players than borderline GM players

If you buffed terran right now in a way that made it easier to play for Diamond players, but had no impact on GM players, then you would see a bunch of terran diamonds jump into low masters. But no Terrans would be jumping from masters to GM. This would increase the % in masters and lower the relative % in GM compared to masters, even though it has nothing to do with GM level balance.

1261	Belief in a Creator is actually something anyone can have.  People who wish to find evidence will know it as they look around them.  Faith is another thing.  For example, in Chrsitianity, faith in God means beleiving not merely that he exists (the starry skies and one's sense of the numinous can do that) but what he has spoken in revelation and his redemptive purpose  in Christ.  Pascal proposed his famous wager because even in his day, knwoledge seemed bifurcated.  Aquinas introduced a synthesis but the material world was starting to 'eat up' the upper-story world of revelation, making it seem mystical and less reasonable than before.  (Remember the difference between Plato and Aristotle).  It seemed at least for some that a leap was required.  I think that whether we live in times when faith is a plausible assumption or in times when it's not, faith in the God of the Judeo-Christian account is something we will always need.  We will always view the world through our worldview.  We will always screen some things out and take in others.  And revelation entails things for which we do not have evidence per se, at least not at this historical juncture.  	"""Dear diary,

That onus is always handed down to teachers though, which is difficult when promoting growth, exploration, individuality, and autonomy is in direct juxtaposition with the “shut up and do your work” idea— one that permeates our culture not only in education, but in what it means for us to be valued citizens. It’s not hard to understand how all of this is polarizing.  Schools are worker production plants for some, and quarantine zone for others, who don’t have family that isn’t too busy for them, that don’t have a community looking out for them (which is the norm for nearly all kids, most notably teenagers, in our culture. Not the exception). 

not saying we shouldn’t discipline more and more effectively to create safer environments but this isn’t just a couple of bad apples. This is a systemic issue that goes way past how we deal with kids once they’ve broken the rules. Idk I’m just out of school and the one thing I’ve noticed is that the prime difference in well behaved kids and poorly behaved ones is how they react to the indifference offered by an education system that will tolerate anything but failure; sexual violence, harassment, kids having breakdowns in the halls being commonplace. All of these are fine as long as enough kids pass. And the ones who won’t? In my experience these kids already know that, it’s what they’ve been taught. "	canada	canada	-1

I wanted to make this post because I see a train wreck happening in the near future. And it isn't going to end well.

The summary of the situation is that my mother wants me to prioritize her over my girlfriend and I want to split the time equally, but she doesn't agree and wants me to break up with my girlfriend so that I can spend more time with her.

However, breaking up for no reason other than my mom wanting us to break up would make me miserable as my girlfriend and I have a steady relationship. My girlfriend knows about my mom trying to break us apart (bad mistake on my part letting her know) and also wants me to see my mom less often in order to spite her.

My original plan would be for me to split time with my mom and girlfriend, seeing my mom during the days and spending the nights with my girlfriend. But now my mom wants me to spend the night at my parents house (even though I already promised my girlfriend I would come home tonight)

I think the root cause of this is my mom feels insecure because she has many friends that were abandoned by their children, and had to take care of themselves even in their old age. I need to find some way to reassure her this will not be the case and that I will continue to take care of my parents, but it would have to involve compromise because my time/resources would be stretched thin if I had to spend all of my time with my mom/dad AND my future family.

Likewise, I think the root cause of my girlfriend wanting to spite my mom is that she will never feel comfortable if her mother in law is constantly trying to take her son away from her and taking away time/energy from our future family.

**TL;DR** My mom doesn't like my girlfriend and my girlfriend doesn't like my mom because they each want to spend more time with me

What should I say to my mother and my girlfriend that would enable them to see eye to eye, or at least accept some form of compromise?

If I were to invest in Costco or Walmart, I do so knowing they make a profit every quarter, have billions in assets, have decades of experience in their industries. Investing in Tesla right now is a gamble because you are looking at a company that has none of those things, they have never been profitable, they don’t have many assets, and they don’t have experience in the industry to navigate its hurdles.

Carbon monoxide is a deadly gas that is colorless and odorless. It sometimes accumulates in buildings, and people often die without noticing that they are breathing it.

1308	"That's what I feel when I see videos of any ARPG in Youtube, including PoE. It's just the nature of the genre.

What I like about D3 is pushing my GR (Greater Rift) limits, it is where the challenge is. I don't care about taking a top spot on the LBs since I can't play much (I never get past paragon 800-850 in a season), but I still like pushing for higher GR levels and manage to get a spot around 700 or so.

Greater Rifts are randomised dungeons with infinitely increasing difficulty levels that you have to complete within 15mins to advance. Every consecutive death has an increased death timer so playing too recklessly is not an option, since it costs you a lot of time. Playing too carefully is not an option either, becuase you will never complete it in time.

This is were the skill comes in... learning to herd big mob packs, what elite affixes you have to skip, stutter stepping, timing your burst with other buffs (like the Convention of Elements buff) etc.

At the end of the day D3 is a simple game aimed at more casual players, players who don't want to deal with the daunting skill tree of PoE, who can get to the endgame fast, who don't want to trade or farm for too long to make a decent build and who can swap builds easily without having to reroll a new character. Imo D3 has a smoother gameplay, but the basic principles of gameplay in both games is the same: kill stuff--&gt; get loot/exp --&gt; kill stronger stuff --&gt;get better loot/exp etc etc.

There is no reason to convince you to play though... you either play and you enjoy it or you don't. I don't know where you are from and how expensive the game is for you so I cannot advice you for or against a refund.

If you don't enjoy D3 I would suggest you try Grim Dawn though... I think it's a great game that is underappreciated largerly due to the time it was released (PoE got a huge expansion adding the ascendancy classes around the time that Grim Dawn was released resulting in Grim Dawn going relatively unnoticed by the ARPG playerbase).

But I do understand that it’s all down to efficiency of a kind.   The headline gets slapped on by an overworked intern who, due to time constraints, likely hasn’t read the whole piece.  That’s why I always wrote my own whenever I published a piece.  They tended to be longer, but they were more accurate!

It would be like you sitting down in a restaurant waiting for a guest who said they would meet you in 20 minutes. The waitress comes by and asked for your order.  You say I'm not ready to order because I'm waiting for someone. The waitress walks away, tells the manager, and manager calls the police without ever coming to your table. 

You are patiently waiting for you friend, when two armed officers come to the table and ask you to leave. You question, why? They say because the manager says you have to go. You asked, ""What have I done.?"" 

They say, ""You have to leave because you have not made a purchase.""

You say, ""I'm waiting for a friend.""

They say, ""You still have to leave. Pick up your belongings and leave.""

There are at least five or six other people in the restaurant who have not ordered because they are waiting for a friend, waiting for their spouse to park the car, waiting for a date to get out of the restroom \(any host of reasons\), but you are singled out.  

You find this absurd and you try to reason with the police. They ask you, in the course of the dialogue, to leave three times. You cannot believe you are being treated this way. Then the police handcuff you and place you under arrest because they have asked you three times to leave. 

As you are walking out, the person you were meeting shows up and asks, ""What is going on?""

You try to explain, but the police still usher you out and take you to jail.

1321	"&gt; I hear a lot about fusion and ""new-generation"" fission reactors being potentially revolutionary in the way we generate electricity. However, it is my understanding that it will be a new way to generate heat, while we will still use old-school steam turbines to convert heat into electricity. My question is, are there any theoretical or ""moonshot"" ideas of a more efficient way to generate electricity

There is a certain type of fusion called [aneutronic fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion) in which no neutrons are produced by the fusion reaction and the energy is carried away by alpha particles. The most desirable of the possible reactions is the [proton + ^(11)Boron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion#Proton-boron) reaction because of the availability of fuel:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One method of producing proton-boron fusion uses one laser to create a boron-11 plasma and another to create a stream of protons that smash into the plasma. The laser-generated proton beam produces a tenfold increase of boron fusion because protons and boron nuclei collide directly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This method releases energy directly as electricity without requiring conversion from heat. 

This conversion of the kinetic energy of alpha particles directly into electricity (without the use of a heat engine) is called [direct energy conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_energy_conversion). 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Experiments suggest a petawatt-scale laser pulse producing a quadwatt of power could launch an ‘avalanche’ fusion reaction.

There is a paper about this:

[Road map to clean energy using laser beam ignition of boron-hydrogen fusion](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/laser-and-particle-beams/article/road-map-to-clean-energy-using-laser-beam-ignition-of-boronhydrogen-fusion/8BE057DC1BC9E0A588FB3ABAA993078C).

Also a more readable announcement from the University of New South Wales  (UNSW): 

[Laser-boron fusion now ‘leading contender’ for energy](https://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science-tech/laser-boron-fusion-now-%E2%80%98leading-contender%E2%80%99-energy).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A laser-driven technique for creating fusion that dispenses with the need for radioactive fuel elements and leaves no toxic radioactive waste is now within reach, say researchers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dramatic advances in powerful, high-intensity lasers are making it viable for scientists to pursue what was once thought impossible: creating fusion energy based on hydrogen-boron reactions. And an Australian physicist is in the lead, armed with a patented design and working with international collaborators on the remaining scientific challenges.

...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Rather than heat fuel to the temperature of the Sun using massive, high-strength magnets to control superhot plasmas inside a doughnut-shaped toroidal chamber (as in NIF and ITER), hydrogen-boron fusion is achieved using two powerful lasers in rapid bursts, which apply precise non-linear forces to compress the nuclei together.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hydrogen-boron fusion produces no neutrons and, therefore, no radioactivity in its primary reaction. And unlike most other sources of power production – like coal, gas and nuclear, which rely on heating liquids like water to drive turbines – the energy generated by hydrogen-boron fusion converts directly into electricity.

It seems to me that this qualifies as both a *""potentially revolutionary in the way we generate electricity""* and *""moonshot idea""* at the same time.

Having said that this is a serious and feasible proposal from actual fusion physicists. It may become feasible in the near future if the anticipated development of multi-petawatt lasers does happen:

See: [Ultraintense 100 petawatt laser aims to uncover the secret of vacuum](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2017/09/ultraintense-100-petawatt-laser-aims-to-uncover-the-secret-of-vacuum.html)."

- Check out as many miradors around sunset as possible! Great time and distinct part of the city's culture

- Pastel de Nata is a must of course. Manteigaria and Belem are both incredible shops to try them.
- Don't feel the need to pay a ton of money for the dinner + fado (look this up if unfamiliar) shows. Check out Bairro Alto in the evening, there's plenty of fado being performed at various restaurants without a charge
- It's smart to have a Belem day as it's out of the main area but otherwise, be ready to criss-cross around the city (part of the fun is exploring Lisbon that way!)

The way the Stormtroopers march were also inspired by the way the Nazis marched in old historical footage. It's all German based.

On top of the name having a German connection with his name, Vader's appearance (specifically his helmet) was inspired by the ancient Japanese samurai's helmets which had a similar shape to them.

is a good example of how a neural network will mistake a bird for a bike.

You have to separate how YOU distinguish a bird from a bike and how a neural network does it.

The pattern in that link looks NOTHING like a toaster, however it has signals that would essentially trigger all the pathways in a neural network model that would make the computer strongly associate it with a toaster regardless of what else is in the scene.

Similar with birds and bikes. You don't need a bird that looks kinda like a bike, or a bike that kinda looks like a bird. You just need something that has some sort of signal that strongly implies something else to the neural network. 

When we train a neural network, we don't have a very clear image into what's going on in the model. It's all just math.

It's not until later additions of Action Comics that we see enough details in the city to recognize the location, adding to the authenticity of these versions. Other scholars have pointed out that the art-form was clearly inspired by much earlier works (particularly Renaissance painter Antonio del Pollaiolo) and that they follow very simplistic story lines ending with the hero saving the girl.

Well, it is a straw man to suggest the abuse of power by those who determine who gets the privilege or not is inevitable. But it is clearly a side effect that becomes possible if we reduce firearm ownership from a right to a privilege. 

It is strange to me that so many people (not necessarily you) want to surrender their rights to a government who's elected officials accept large sums of money form companies and individuals and are occasionally forced to resign because they abused their position of power for sexual exploits. And then allow only the police to possess firearms when they protest the police for believing them to being corrupt or abusing their power.

As far as solving the issue of violence in our country I do not think this is something that can be solved by more legislation. Turning law abiding individuals into criminals because they possess an item which has the potential to harm someone at some time in the future is not an effective solution or we would have banned private ownership of vehicles long ago. If anything I think we should simplify gun laws, get rid of all the gray areas and victimless crimes such as set up national reciprocity, deregulate silencers, sbrs, and sbss, eliminate gun free zones, eliminate laws that prohibit the possession of ""high"" cap mags in states that restrict that, etc. If we simplify the laws though we need to maximize the punishment of criminal offenders. People who use guns for violent crimes should receive maximum sentences. Using a gun during the facilitation of a felony should add 20+ years to your prison time for the original felony, lets make the people who use guns for bad things realize this could cost them their freedom for life not just 3-8 years.

We took the approach of outlawing possession in the war against drugs and it has been a disaster. Some argue it created a market in which gangs kill each other to claim territory for which to sell their illegal product. Opiod overdose [killed more people than all firearms](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) (including suicides) in 2016 (projections for 2017 were just as high but I haven't seen any official statistic released). Gun ownership is at an all time high and the homicide rate is the lowest it has been since the 1960's.

I believe that stopping violence requires a cultural change by everyone in society. I believe we all need to hold ourselves more accountable for our actions, especially parents of their kids. The amount of times a child under 12 tells an adult in public to ""go fuck yourself"" is too high. We also need to live our lives to the higher standard we are holding our kids to or they won't live to that higher standard if nobody is watching. So gone are the days of telling someone who cut you off in traffic to ""go fuck yourself"", the kids are listening and they noticed. There need to be real life consequences for decisions that people make. No more 3 months of jail time for raping a passed out woman behind a dumpster, No more letting under 18 kids break the law over and over to only get a slap on the wrist, threats made online through social media need to be followed up with real life consequences. Teachers need to let parents know when their kids are bullying or being victimized by bullying and the parents need to actually care. 

Even if we did all of these things it would still not eliminate all violence, but I think it would help and the only side effect would be a more polite society. But most people calling for gun control do not like these suggestions because it requires them to be nicer to their neighbors, discipline their kids, suppress road rage, and confront their own behavioral problems. For the majority of them, it is just easier to scream at law makers to ""do something"" instead of doing something themselves."	guns	guns	-1

Let me know if you can read in those languages and if the wiki link is misrepresenting its source. 

Switzerland also has [strong legislation regarding who can and can't own a gun, and gun shops must follow a strict procedure when selling](http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerland-gun-laws-rates-of-gun-deaths-2018-2#gun-sellers-follow-strict-licensing-procedures-7), which is also the case in Canada, but not so in the states. Also, [gun ownership in Switzerland is lower than the US, but gun deaths are still the highest of any country in Europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/swiss-guns/553448/). 

Also, things can be related to two factors. Switzerland also has strong social safety nets, so it isn't really like they have huge problems with other types of crime that are likely to cause gun deaths (drugs, robberies, etc). 

All in all, it seems really disingenuous to suggest that guns have nothing to do with gun deaths. Switzerland has high rates of gun ownership, but lower than the states, it's extremely hard to get them if you're on any sort of list, they take care to make sure they know who's getting a gun and why, it's hard to transport them, and the social safety nets present prevent the non mass shooting types of gun crimes. However, at the end of the day, their gun crimes remain higher than the rest of europe and their gun ownership remains much smaller than gun ownership in the states.

1463	"It's a funny thing that almost everyone who says it can't be a diablo MMO always starts with ""although I would love a diablo mmo.."". 

I personally think that there is a huge market for Diablo 3 and a great opportunity for Blizz to merge the gameplay elements of two amazing games. 

Furthermore, you can speak of market saturation but the market is shrinking in part because very few new quality titles have been offered in the last couple of years in the MMO space. WoW is a cash cow right now for Blizzard, but a company that leans on it's cash cow is a company in decline. To stay in marketing speak, Blizzard needs a Star. 

The argument that it would split its base also doesn't hold up. WoW subscriptions have been declining for years, Blizzard shouldn't be worried about splitting their base, they should be worried about losing customers and clearly no WoW expansion can't truly fix the decline in the long term. 

My bold prediction is World of Diablo as MMO that will instantly rekindle the whole mmo genre and create a hype unlike we have ever seen, while the WoW series will slowly but surely go to free to play status (or perhaps free to play only for World of Diablo subscribers).

why do people disagree when I say banning drugs like marijuana would stop their use, or atleast dramatically bring it down

it would - and if western europe banning everything works, why doesnt it work in north america?"	"Consider the convenience price. We considered switching in the past and this is the reason we did not. The expendable water filters, minerals, and CO2 all cost; so does the bottled water, but the difference is I can buy the latter at the grocery store. There is also an up-front cost to purchase the equipment -- which is not available at the grocery store. The bottled water is instantly available with no work from me, while I need to wait and plan ahead for a drink made at home. I can throw a 9L pack of water in my car and never purchase a drink away from home. It is far less likely that I will diligently take my single reusable bottle of homemade water with me everywhere I go, nor is it likely that it will hold enough. This is even less practical for my husband due to the realities of his job. 

Furthermore, we don't own our home, we can't install a permanent fancy system. The kind of filters you can use in a pitcher all come in loads of plastic anyway, and I sincerely doubt they're more environmentally efficient on a per-liter basis than the mass filtration the bottling plant would use. To buy these filters, we need to drive 45min away from home! It sounded attractive to us too, but when you consider the practicalities it gets more and more ridiculous. We're not going to switch for now. It may make more sense after our next move, especially if we get stuck somewhere without recycling again. 

As far as I'm concerned, this is our dumb thing. We don't waste money on cable, we don't smoke, we limit packaged products in the rest of our grocery shopping, it's not like we're unconcerned about health, finances, or environment. I agree that bottled water use isn't an ideal choice, but sometimes it irks me that people get so insistent about its evils when other choices people make are arguably worse and those are normalized. I'm sure something you enjoy consuming is not good for your health, your wallet, or the environment, and I'm sure you made a considered choice when you decided you could consume that thing and still keep your values.

One reality of politics is that there really are 'sides' on issues, and two sides' views can be mutually exclusive.

My brother and I were not super close growing up. We didn't have the same social circles or anything but when we got home we got on alright. 

The problem started when my father got a job in another town. I was in my final year of high-school (15-ish) so it was decided I would stay alone with my brother (17-ish) for the year and my dad would move out with the rest of my family. So, for about a year it was just my brother and I, and for that year we were constantly at each other's throats. I would come home late, he would yell and scream in my face, I would scream back. He would take my phone and password protect the laptop so I couldn't use it, so I would refuse to cook or clean for him. It was one thing after another until one time I stayed out until fairly late with my friend. I was with her parents, I was safe and I had let my dad know. But the moment I came home my brother sat me down and threatened to beat me with a large stick he had. He said because I was his younger sister I had to do everything he said. I was terrified, not only because of the threat, but because I'd seen my dad do the same thing to my mum (except my dad would follow through with the threat). I knew how terrible it would end for me, so I shut up and did as he said. I slept with a rock by my bed to feel safe after that, and I never spoke to him unless strictly necessary. After a while my parents had enough, so my mum came out to live with me and my brother moved in with my dad. 

Eventually, my brother went off to college and so did I. We'd meet back at the house during summer break and soon we talked like old times. But the moment we leave the house its radio silence, nothing from either one of us (this is my fault, he tried in the beginning but I would ignore all his calls). 

The truth is though, I miss him. He's grown from then, that's for sure, he's not as controlling and respects my freedom. But after being the one that blocked him off for so long I'm not sure how to rebuild that bridge. We don't leave near each other, and I'm pretty busy with college so it's not like I can often.

[In South Australia when it is windy or sunny there is often enough renewable generation to cover demand and a bare minimum of the more expensive gas generation is used](https://opennem.org.au/#/regions/sa).

Even so, nearly every day from about 5:00 to 7:00 there is a peak of use of the more expensive gas when the sun goes down. Because gas is considerably more expensive the spot price for electricity peaks somewhat during this period compared to the price in the middle of the day.

1488	"Perspective is your friend.  Richard Dawkins has a quote that helped me a lot during the throes of my depression after my suicide attempt:





""We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.

The instant at which a particular spermatozoon penetrated a particular egg was, in your private hindsight, a moment of dizzying singularity. It was then that the odds against your becoming a person dropped from astronomical to single figures.

The lottery starts before we are conceived. Your parents had to meet, and the conception of each was as improbable as your own. And so on back, through your four grandparents and eight great grandparents, back to where it doesn’t bear thinking about.

   This is another respect in which we are lucky. The universe is older than a hundred million centuries. Within a comparable time the sun will swell to a red giant and engulf the earth. Every century of hundreds of millions has been in its time, or will be when its time comes, ‘the present century’. Interestingly, some physicists don’t like the idea of a ‘moving present’, regarding it as a subjective phenomenon for which they find no house room in their equations. But it is a subjective argument I am making. How it feels to me, and I guess to you as well, is that the present moves from the past to the future, like a tiny spotlight, inching its way along a gigantic ruler of time. Everything behind the spotlight is in darkness, the darkness of the dead past. Everything ahead of the spotlight is in the darkness of the unknown future. The odds of your century being the one in the spotlight are the same as the odds that a penny, tossed down at random, will land on a particular ant crawling somewhere along the road from New York to San Francisco. In other words, it is overwhelmingly probable that you are dead.
In spite of these odds, you will notice that you are, as a matter of fact, alive. People whom the spotlight has already passed over, and people whom the spotlight has not reached, are in no position to read a book… What I see as I write is that I am lucky to be alive and so are you."""

I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq7KtM9vhHg) video yesterday and stumbled upon this jacket Alen was wearing in the video. I'm currently looking for a winter/rain jacket and this one looks just perfect.

Only problem is - I can't find anything in the video about a brand og logo about the manufacturer.

I've written directly to the guy on Instagram, but with 155k followers i don't think he's going to respond anytime soon.

Hopefully you can help me identify it so in can wear it during this winter :)

If the team moves away from Bortles I would not expect a rookie to take us to the playoffs.

We would be smart to go after a vet (Tyrod Taylor maybe?) and see if he can keep us competitive while the rookie develops.

I'm hoping we snag a TE at the end of the first round, and then grab a RT or CB in the second/third.

If they re-sign Robinson and let Lee walk, and cut Hurns we might see a WR get picked.

"I'd like to pick apart that last line, if you don't mind. The linguistics here are actually interesting. 

In 1960, people actually WERE homophobic. They were afraid of getting AIDS. That was a thing. Admittedly, not always a rational thing, but information was slower to disseminate before the internet. That fear manifested itself similarly to hatred and was co-opted by actual hate groups, but it's important to realize these terms didn't appear out of thin air. There is a reason their meanings have shifted from the literal roots to the more common definition. It was a process. The original ""goal"" of terming people ""homophobic"" was so you could explain that their fears were irrational. Unfortunately, when we tried to do that, we ended up applying the label to the entire sub-set of the human population who has an issue with homosexuals. While we could talk down the ones who were uninformed and scared (and, we have - look at public perception), the rabid and vocal individual's co-opted the label because it sounds better than ""assholes.""

Likewise, in 2001 I can guarantee you there were some people who were actually afraid the Middle Eastern guy in the next row was dangerous. The origin of the use of the term ""Islamaphobia"" is rooted in a discussion of the unjust application of policies and emotions that were behind stuff like the American TSA's  ""pat downs"" to check suspicious individuals for weapons. They were almost universally applied in an illogical (but highly emotional) manner, allowing people to exert control over a ""situation."" The label twas intended to be applied to people who were ACTUALLY afraid and could be taught that their fear was largely unfounded, but was again claimed as a less evil label by hate groups or radical extremists. There was a good intention, here, though I'm not sure if it worked. 

My point, though I'm not sure I made it very well, is that you shouldn't assume Johnny is an asshole. Some people are assuredly still afraid some crazy man with a bomb is going to walk into their office and detonate. It's the fear of the unknown, something they know they can't really control or stop. If you educate these people, explain things like that Sikhs are not Muslims or how few actual Islam-inspired terrorism deaths there are each year (particularly in Canada), you can accomplish a great deal more than by branding them as bigots and moving on with life. Sometimes, a bit of compassion is more useful than scorn. "	canada	canada	-1

"There is a question of accuracy vs artistic intent. Some photos that have been colorized will simply not have accuracy but artistic intent. While others will have a more accurate reference to the subject's color tone and pallette. 

1. Manual coloring can be simply referencing known color ads, diagrams and notes, personal journals from the time period or guessing based on color trends of the time period.

2. Computerized colorization has come light years ahead through the use of what's called deep learning. The most famous version of image processing comes through the term deep convolutional neural networks or CNN for short. 

Basically you take the pixels from the black and white and look at their assigned values. It's a mathematical spectrum from 0 to 255 with 1 channel. 

You start by looking at a group of the nearest pixels next to the one you're looking at. You do some math on all of these pixels. Then keep sliding over to the pixel next to it. 

This happens as many times as it makes sense. Then it can look at the outputs of all those pixels you just looked at. It does this multiple times as well. 

The intended output would be 3 channels of red, green and blue 0-255 for each for that one specific pixel. 

The computer does this over and over again until it feels it can discern  a pixel's color. 

Now HOW it does it is a matter of debate. If you're looking for artistic value vs accuracy. Accuracy wise you can provide a training set that was colored photos turned black n white. You can then let the computer check it's work over iterations until it's fairly accurate. 

There will still be a lot of variance but that's one way computers do it. I can get deeper but it's actually mathematically heavy and it's not the first neural net you should really learn imo.

1559	"I was also raised to never expect better and I come from a family with generations of abuse. I know my great grandmother and grandfather were both abused and grew up in abusive families. I was raised being forced fed the false idea that I was my father's property and he could do anything he wanted to me and I had no rights. 

Yet as young as 14, I was protecting my mother from my father's physical abuse and pulling him off of her and getting beat in her place so that she wouldn't get hurt. Finally at 21, I cut all ties with my father and helped my sister move out as well and she lives with me currently. My mom never left him even though I tried to convince her. I wonder why I was so different in how I reacted vs my mom. I just know that I could never be complicit in my child's abuse like my mom was even if I was also a victim of abuse. I was a child and still did something to stop my abuser and did what I could to protect my mother despite the repercussions being horrible for me but I can't say she ever did the same for me even though she was an adult woman. 

Before anyone claims I am victim blaming just know that I was also a victim of physical abuse and psychological/verbal abuse since I was 6 months old (father would slap me, a baby when I ""misbehaved"" to the point I learned to stop crying at the sight of him until I was 21 when he tried to strangle me and then beat me so badly I blacked out) to the point my father nearly killed me twice. I just can't make sense of it and I can't sympathize with it. 

At a certain point, the mother was choosing her own life over her children's no matter how much she was abused and brainwashed herself - when she became a parent, her paramount responsibility was to always take actions that would protect her children. There must have been things she could have done since her daughter was able to do these things to save the rest of her family..."

As for Peter's statement about Lot's righteousness, you're reading more into it than what it actually says. To wit: Peter says that Lot was righteous while *in* Sodom &amp; Gomorrha (see verse 8), and that because of that he was delivered from the cities' destruction. He doesn't comment on Lot's spiritual state *afte*r his escape. That's another story. So Peter's statement, as reported, is accurate."	"It's not just one step you have to make.

The trick of Satan is to mislead people in crowds. Satan doesn't have power over you if you don't give him your power. And that's exactly what people do if they go to a denomination. They give their brains to their sectarian so called scholars.

I read more Scriptures then you think, of different religions. And i see the same pattern over and over again. The religion gets hijacked by these sectarians who operate from the shadows.. And the crowd follows. And everyone thinks they are right, just because of their environment that is following it as well. 

Numbers do not say anything. The Scriptures teach us that the majority is misguided. Deal with it. If you want to be that blind follower. Then that's your choice. People don't care. They don't really believe. That's why they just follow their sect and environment. The majority follows the Anti Christ. Does that mean it's the Truth? Just because of the numbers? 

What about all those Jews who uphold their false Judaism which contradicts the Tora. What about all those Arabs who uphold their false Islam which contradicts the Quran. What about all those Hindus who uphold their false Hinduism which contradicts the Veda. Etc. etc. etc. 

If you see the pattern just once. It will open your eyes. Never follow the majority. If you see a group/denomination/sect etc. then know that they are mixing Truth with Falsehood. That's just the reality.

-Windmills: kinetic energy in the air to electricity

-Hydroelectric: varies, but in dams it's gravitational potential energy into kinetic water into electricity, and in wave/paddlewheel it's kinetic water to electrical

-Chemical: Strictly speaking, batteries generate heat, but it's as a strictly waste product. The electricity comes from the energy difference between compounds.

There's not much to be done in terms of more efficient heat conversion: IIRC, the solar farms that use molten salt for heat gathering retain more than 90% of the heat before being used for generating power, and there are hard limits to how efficient that heat transfer can be.

It's been a LONG time, but I think a non-mixing water to water heat transfer peaks somewhere around 70% efficiency, for example."	"I just imagine a giant wave coming onto the beach and a row of knives (or large rocks) cutting it up and breaking it apart.

"	"Thank you for your reply; that sounds like a truly awful diagnostic process for you.

I’d like to add two thoughts:

First, when months or years of labs, imaging, biopsies, genetic testing, regional referrals, etc are back negative or nondiagnostic, what should happen next?

At what point can a clinician decide that the edge of medical science has been reached?  How many negative ANAs is enough?

There are many instances, I think, that a label hasn’t or can’t be given but it becomes reasonably certain that the disease isn’t (inherently) life-threatening. Can the decision to focus on symptom management rather than looking further be justified or is it de facto quitting/abandonment?

Second, I would ask you to consider the other side of the ‘xyz’ coin.  Are there any disputed diseases that you do not believe exist?  Even if another physician suspects it?

The patient with a [Morgellons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29467580/?i=1&amp;from=morgellons&amp;filters=ffrft) diagnosis who requests antiparasitics or a patient with  [wind turbine syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24804716/?i=2&amp;from=wind%20turbine%20syndrome&amp;filters=ffrft) who requests a PET scan and benzodiazepines...is there a point at which it can be conscionable for you to decline treatment or workup?

I was grateful that she explained the ‘morphodite’ thing, which I would never have got.

And I read it in my 20s and cried. Everything my teacher said was true. The scenes we had highlighted were powerful and painful. The imagery meant things. And oh the walls closing in on Scout.

"I think that's a good enough laymen understanding of the recession. To be more specific, financial institutions knowingly misrepresented the risk of certain risk-stratified groups of loans that they were selling to other institutions. Those institutions often turned around and did the same thing. And each step along the way, the new institutions did the same tricky bookkeeping where they hid the high risk involved in the base investments by grouping them with low-risk investments but selling them as if they were ALL low-risk investments in that stratum.

So once the original loans started defaulting, it all came down like a house of cards.

There were myriad factors and reasons for this, but a big one was huge bonuses to financial institution employees for sales volumes, with very few consequences if the loans defaulted. So they were basically lying about value and printing themselves money until it all came back to bite them in the ass. Well, not them, but literally all of America. They mostly got off scot-free."

&gt;Producers claim Polish was only on set six days, but allegedly struck a deal with two on-set cameramen to “commandeer” the raw footage with a plan to “release an infringing, unauthorized film of his own.”

&gt;They are also worried that Polish’s film will “exploit the MBCI members and culture without their permission, all for their personal aggrandizement and gain.”

1654	"Name: alxr.4730

I generally enjoy PvE a lot more than other game modes - PvP is fun, but quickly exhausting, and WvW bores me o.o

I like not only the more competitive PvE options, such as raiding and fractals, but also the enjoyment of world exploring, finding secret little areas and purely enjoying the game's beauty - it's just so damn pretty \o/

While I've farmed quite a lot for my legendary armor set and a pair of weapons (I raided enough to figure at one point I might as well do the set, and praise the Six for giving us Predator /or, anet/), I really dislike farming. After the nth istan I just wanted to impale myself on my greatsword, tbh. However, all the legendaries are amazing in both idea, lore and design, and getting them all is a bit of a carrot on a stick. That said, getting the full set would be beautiful :)

As for the luck, you'll need lots of it, whether it be for graduation, working or just irl. So, I widh you have all the luck you need and hopefully lots of success in future endeavors \o/"	"Hi Tophie,

My name's VicV, been a dedicated Guild Wars 2 player since launch.  
Still fondly remember the pure excitement during the beta weekends.
I've quietly lurked your stream quite a bit and was always in awe of your ambition.
Really enjoyed your music choice and will to help new players.
Great to hear you're about to focus on more scholarly IRL achievements.
Best of luck in that regard Tophie!

Putting my hat in the giveaway because I am as you described.
Always been motivated to play and have thoroughly enjoyed GW2.

Currently my favorites activities are Wvw/Raids and [GRIFFON flying](https://imgur.com/a/roQFeJq)!
The freedom of movement the griffon allows across maps is truly amazing.
Most days you can find me at one of the griffon Master adventures,
practicing flight patterns while looting and scooting the various chests on map.
It may not make much money, but identifying gear with lots of magic find can yield nice prizes.

World Vs World is another GW2 activity that has captivated me for [countless hours](https://imgur.com/a/La3QLay).
While I have only dabbled with commanding, immense time has been spent small group and even solo play.
My favorite class to play in WvW is... THIEF   Yes, believe it. Though every class is fun and interesting.
To me, thief has shined as the most exciting to play for years; even if it's played stealthy.  
Love ganking even though some consider it controversial.  WvW is so fun sometimes, the rewards got better too.
Would be great to command more considering my server (JQ) needs it now more than ever.

Last year a friend let me into the 150 Li Raid Pugventures he led, even though it was raid progress for me.
Fast forward to today and there's a full set of [heavy Envoy armor](https://imgur.com/a/LTukLiN) ready to be forged on spellbreaker.
Something about having all the components of a legendary still separated ready to go is so pleasing.
So much so that there's also a full set of [light WvW Mistforged precursor armor](https://imgur.com/a/9rsxG7h) ready to be forged on weaver.
On top of that I've got all the components for [Verdarach](https://imgur.com/a/e3oD9HR) and Warbringer on my soulbeast.

The reason they're not assembled is because it would be nice to have an audience.
To show and share with in the community on the process and an achievement.
There was once a dream to have one legendary of each weapon type, and so I strived for it.
Crafted many of the very legendaries you're gifting here, still not quite enough.
To make VicV the lucky one is to complete this goal and then some.
You see I'd only possibly bind three;  Frenzy,  Kamohoali'i Kotaki, and The Flameseeker Prophecies.
That would complete my collection and the rest of the set could be given away just as was given to me.

Remember the WoodenPotatoes contest and the winner Shrimpy Plays?
I happen to catch one of Shrimpys streams after, it was his birthday and he was celebrating.
He was doing some WvW and ecto gambling, looked to have partied quite copiously.
It would seem he gifted some of his legendaries to people close to him 
and was planning ways to give the rest to GW2 community members. 

Prizes of this grandeur are an achievement from the gift-giver; to give the ultimate greatness to one winner.
That winner then can continue giving, if that is their intention (which it is mine).
The WP Get PoF contest grand prize is only an Eternity shy of what Tophie wants to give.
So Tophie's Lucky One is technically a one-up of sorts, as far as grand prizes are concerned.

Tophie streams progress on Twitch quite regularly so this giveaway seems true.
A lot of the time I've watched its newbie helping streams while working on this prize.
While Tophie's Lucky One isn't as grandiose technically as WP video creation Get PoF Sponsored Contest,
it maintains more accessibility for contestants;  a write in on reddit/to Tophie why you want a windfall.
Put in whatever effort pleases you in telling your story to Tophie.  To win a lottery you must play it at all.

Well Tophie, there's my story.  I'm a true PvX player loyal to the game Guild Wars 2.
Wish I could stream/entertain and give back to the community for the time and fun I've already had in game.
Certainly a prize like this would jumpstart interest in a streamer, which is what I'd hope to apply.
Surely current popular GW2 Twitch streamers could offer the same gratitude in passing on the luck through giveaways.
Even building up their account, either way they have to write in to you too!

Thank you very much for the consideration and your contribution to the Guild Wars 2 community.
Hopefully whoever recieves the luck passes it on in both form and spirit.
Glad to have the opportunity to even write about my GW2/interests in game, feels freeing having done this.
Wishing all the best in your next endeavours Tophie. May you be very successful.

Its never going to be implemented without anyone losing money, its supposed to benefit consumers not businesses. If people aren't OK with their data being processed and sold then I don't think they really should have been signed up to whatever game in the first place. Likewise, if a business isn't OK with following these laws, they shouldn't sell to EU customers because they now have a legal expectation that their data has certain protections. Businesses that don't treat data properly leaving the market isn't a bug, its a feature. 

Another thing you said about large corporations ignoring the fines - GDPR is specifically intended to prevent this by offering fines of up to 4% of global revenue per violation. No matter how large a business is, 4% of revenue is a huge fine especially when it isn't only generated in the EU. Combined with the reduced obligations I can't see this hitting small businesses unfairly. Those that have clearly tried to comply with the spirit of the law will almost certainly not face fines given competent implementation.

The GDPR has quite a lot of documentation but tonnes of companies just didn't do anything for most of their 2 year window to take action, which is why it seems like not enough. Some companies assumed they would never need to comply. More practical examples could be given but not trying has this effect."	"Well, as much as the trends change, people still pay for good single player experiences, just look at the Witcher 3 and the reddit circlejerk for it. Even though a lot of Valve fans have lost faith in Valve over the last few years, I think Valve still has a large fanbase. Just look at how big r/Artifact is, despite the fact that Valve has given basically no marketing to it.

Your perspective seems to be arguing that Valve would released another HL2 again in 2018 and it would flop, but they're not making HL2. HL3 could still be as groundbreaking and innovative as HL and Portal.

&gt;I would doubt that it would be a top seller of the year game, unless Valve pumps out a ridiculous amount of marketing for it

But Valve totally could _easily_ do that if they chose to do so. They're sitting on mountains of money, it would be easy to hype the game up to insanity. They could probably make the biggest marketing campaign the games industry has ever seen, and still be in the green."	Games	Games	-1

In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place.

Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The Senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.

The ""Illuminati"" does exist, in the sense that secret societies do exist, which contain powerful members, who have their own plans for this world. Unfortunately, you subject yourself to a plethora of disinformation when you research these subjects, and the Illuminati especially, with the words of Leo Taxil, William Guy Carr, etc. still alive and well. But for our purposes, the ""Illuminati"" definitely exists. The symbolism you refer to is all intertwined. Most of it can be traced back to Babylon. It's Kabbalah. It's left hand path. A symbol itself is originally meaningless, but ascribe it some purpose and it becomes an invaluable form of communication that can be hidden in plain sight. Rituals (performances) become a way to subliminally alter the consciousness of the masses. That's what magick is.

1677	"It certainly wasn't meant to be a trap, only to submit that there is a clear difference between your example of explaining something to your children as a comparable gulf between God and us - *you* are the shortcoming in not being able to teach/communicate effectively at your child's level. You haven't been trained, you don't know the words, you don't know how to demonstrate, you don't have the wisdom, activity book, whatever, and while no one can perhaps teach the emotional aspect of disease or debility, there are people trained to communicate with children to understand these cognitive concepts. But God, who is omniscient and omnipotent, has no limitation - were there something he wanted us to understand, there is literally (literally, literally) nothing in his way... In fact, any shortcomings we would have in understanding something he could simply correct for us. The clear answer from a theological perspective to counter this is just to say that we are not meant to understand, that this is merely a part of the process of coming to terms with our faith in his plan and his unlimited wisdom. I don't buy that, being secular, but it's a reasonable answer from that perspective.

Also, the square circle is a bad example, too... These are clearly definable, tangible concepts whose form is rooted in strict guideline - any change, and it ceases to become what it originally was. We're not talking about transmutation of concepts that must simultaneously be what they once were and another thing all at once, this is asking to explain a single concept. It may be a complicated concept, but it is a single concept that stands by itself. I don't think the Christian God would be limited in such a fashion, so, again, it's a choice that he has to not explain it, and for whatever reason he would choose."	"That's what I'm getting at tho.

1696	"I am not convinced by any of the candidates. They are a bit wild, some like horses, but no more hints. 

Harwin sounds interesting, but assuming Brandon impregnated a woman with 11 or 12 years is a bit of stretch. If Martin wanted to imply that he would have made Brandon older. Also everyone would know it in Winterfell and Ned would treat him differently. Waymar Royce sounds intriguing on paper and would serve a narrative purpose, but only superficial connection. If that had been a thing, there would have been more hints during the books. Ashara Dayne's child seems the most likely candidate. 

Also, your forgot one theoretical candidate: Jon Snow. He could be Brandon's bastard. Ned claiming him to be his son would both offer him the status as Star without threatening his children's position. Jon is a annoyance as eldest son of Ned, he would have a better claim if he was the original heir's son. Disclaimer: I don't believe that myself, R+L=J is pretty much set for me. "	"I also don't think 'leading Tywin on a merry chase' was part of the original plan.  When Catelyn is returning from Renly's camp, one of Edmure's outriders states that Robb's forces are plundering the west, driving sheep and goods and the like.  Someone even laughs at the idea of the Greatjon being a shepherd if I recall.  That doesn't strike me as the 'highly mobile' force, just waiting for Tywin's attack.

Not to mention, Tywin's defense of King's Landing was only possible if Renly were to die and a bunch of his loyal supporters joined up with the Lannisters to defeat Stannis.  By the time Robb was making all his plans, Stannis and Renly were not fighting one another and were seemingly advancing on King's Landing, so I imagine the plan was mostly ""Hey, we're gonna go start messing up the West to put Tywin in an unwinnable position where he has to choose between his lands and King's Landing.""  But when Tywin advanced on Robb's paltry forces that are apparently pillaging and looting and siege-ing pointless castles, Edmure jumps in between them because that shit is gonna get messy real fast.

Robb's initial push into the west had to just be a couple goals.

1) Stop the new Lannister army from hemming them in.

2) Put Tywin in a position where he can't be everywhere at once

3) Count on the Baratheon bros to be the real muscle to finish off the Lannisters.

I truly don't believe Edmure is so dumb that he sat in war councils, heard the plan of ""And then we draw Tywin west and trap him at this location our scouts found"" and then turn around and say to his river lords ""Nah, we're supposed to do this different thing instead"".

When Edmure is confronted with his 'mistake', he says he was never told, and Robb only says that he was told to hold Riverrun, which means that yes, apparently Edmure never knew about the plan to trap Tywin.  That makes me think there was no plan to trap Tywin by the time Robb left."	asoiaf	asoiaf	-1

To explain why the braking force is so small, consider that the Moon is only ~1/80th Earth's mass, far away (238,900 miles, 384,400 km), and the force of gravity falls off at the square of distance.

Since the Earth is so much bigger, it has a comparatively huge amount of angular momentum, all of it left over from when it formed. The Moon has already been fully 'braked' by Earth's own tidal force affecting it, which is why it always faces us with the same side. Meanwhile, we've got so much braking left to do to reach that point that even after 4.5 billion years of tidal braking already, we'd still need 50 billion more years to be mutually tidally locked with the moon.

It seems like the lawyers were strong arming her to try and get a settlement quietly without it going to court, probably because the case might be tainted by the air that I breathe/creep case. 

Negotiations failed and probably ended with ""see you in court"". Del Rey then tweets they are suing which makes Radiohead look like hypocrites as they were sued for creep. 

Fans are saying it's out of character and they are right, likely because she was actually dealing with a relentless legal team representing the publisher.
So the publisher uses the opportunity to save face by pointing out they haven't filed yet, possibly to compromise her integrity. 
The reason they haven't filed yet is probably they are not 100% confident in the win or are still building their case.

1723	"I'll give my 2 cents. 22F. I used to answer that question when a guy asked it, but I was much younger - then I realized it's not a question guys really want the answer for. Most times it gets asked as a way to judge a girl. This is how we (myself and lots of female friends) think about it. If you are honest and tell him the truth he might be like ""whoa"" and everything is changed forever. If you worry about being judged and throw a low number at him, he looks at you funny like....yeah nah that's too low, what's the real number... then you have to lie more to cover the original lie when you said 2 or something ridiculous.  :)

Then if you say ""I'm not answering that"" - now he has to know why, so you're still screwed. 

If you're dating someone and you're worried about safety then get tested and then you know - easy peasy. Asking a female what her ""number"" is though is just insecurity on his part and usually a worry that we've had more partners than him.

Personally, I won't date a guy who asks anymore and usually dated older guys anyway - who generally don't care. "	"Before I start this id like to inform you guys that i’m overdramatic so i’m never sure if my feelings are the right kind of feelings or not.

My boyfriend (21)  and I (18) literally decided we should be in a relationship together three days ago and bad things are already starting to happen. 

Almost every time I go to his house we have sex because of our high sex drives. There’s nothing different about this day except the fact that I was on my period.. my heaviest day actually. 

We started missionary and everything was great and everything felt great for the both of us. For some reason he came quick today which I was flattered by and it turned me on more. By the second time he came I wanted to get on top of him because that’s my favorite position. 

He gets from on top of me and lays down but before he lays down for some odd reason he takes a whiff of my bloody vagina and then gags. So there’s this moment when i’m looking at him and he’s looking at me. Maybe he didn’t mean to do it out loud who knows. He asked me if I was okay and I replied yes but then asked are YOU okay? 

I looked at his penis and saw my blood all over which made him gag again. I bent down to smell it and yes, of course it was disgusting but I didnt know it was this disgusting. Listen to this 

He says nothing. Gets up from the bed, runs into his bathroom, and he begins throwing up all the sushi we got this afternoon. It wasn’t just a little bit of throw up but a ton. 

I’m in this weird situation when idk if I should follow him or stay there or what so I decided to just put my clothes on. After I did that I walked outside because hearing him throw up made me sick. Soon after he followed me out there asking if I was mad and that he was sorry. I’m not sure if I should be mad honestly. I have no clue how I should feel in this situation. After that I came up with an excuse then hurriedly left and neither of us texted each other. 

How should I feel about this embarrassing thing that happened to me? I don’t think i’ll recover. Will he get sick every time he thinks of having sex with me now? Was his reaction normal? "	sex	sex	-1

1768	"The best movie-related experience was not even watching a movie, but camping out for tickets to Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I was in high school, and we went there after we were done for the day. A couple lawn chairs, thermal-wear (it was in the middle of winter in Sweden), and some snacks. We sat around talking, having fun, and meeting people. A couple of guys behind us started talking to us, and it turned out one of them was french, the other from Iceland, and they had a boombox on which we listened to Opeth and french hiphop. Finally, we got the tickets (first row balcony) for the midnight premiere, and managed to go home and get maybe an hour or so of sleep, and then right back up to school again.

The movie itself was great (even though I fell asleep at one of the fifteen different false endings...), but the experience of being together and camping out for those tickets is the memory that really stuck with me."	There definitely is laughing in the movie from the hosts. However, I feel like the laughing was supposed to make the audience extremely uncomfortable and disgusted with the hosts, rather than us laughing with them.

1770	"**A Race to Grandmaster – Schlooti vs mMrBanshee - and a drunk stream to celebrate the beginning of an end to 
a friendship!**

Hey, my name is HuShang, I’ve been coaching starcraft 2 extensively for the past several years. Recently, two of my students told me separately that they wanted to reach grandmaster in a single year. A VERY ambitious goal. It’s quite difficult for most players to reach grandmaster alone, not to mention trying to make it there in just a single year! But… they’re both very competitive and told me they’re going to practice diligently. So, I told them it was possible to make it with a lot of hard work and dedication. 
     
Here’s the crazy part though: They want to RACE to grandmaster. Yep, you heard me. And they want to let you in on the fun! They are both going to stream their progress regularly, and you’re free to tune in and monitor their progress! You’ll be able to follow them, give them advice, talk smack with them against their rival, and root for your favourite player to make it to grandmaster first! And what’s a race without a bit of punishment for the loser? 
We’ll be letting YOU the viewers decide on their punishment. You can vote here at this link below:

Without further ado, lets introduce the competitiors! First up, the zerg player!   
    
**Schlooti**  - currently platinum league!
   
Schlooti is a 24-year-old Australian who moved to Canada because the grass looked greener on the other side all the way up until the snow hit. He is currently in his third year of a Kinesiology bachelor’s degree and spends his spare time rock-climbing and gaming. Many of Schlooti’s practice habits come from a history of music where he had to practice for hours on end, refining a single section over and over. The man is, not surprisingly, taken considering his heart throbbing looks and both him and his significant other are owned by a cat named Lilly. To keep the lights on, this dude works as a delivery driver for dominos… So, you know he is a professional at delivering on time. Can you say the same for mMRBanshee?   
   
[Follow schlooti at this link!]( https://www.twitch.tv/schlooti)     

And your second competitor! Playing protoss… mMrBanshee!   
   
**mMrBanshee** - currently platinum league!
   
At the age of 24 mMrBanshee is a Brazilian gamer who has accomplished many things including bringing a box full of pig eyes to school, and dropping out of college twice. Now after a life full of excitement he streams SC2 and chills after work so he can provide for his SO. mMrBanshee used to compete in Taekwondo at a very high level until the fateful day he, due to overtraining, got injured. He’s looking to bring all of that ferocious determination to Starcraft now. Schlooti is destined to lose this race, he lack's the discipline of a real fighter. His opponent will have you believe that he can deliver things on time, but let's be honest… we’ve all had problems with domino's delivery before.

1771	Eh? Bernardo didn't miss preseason, he arrived in May. He also had a season to learn the system before the last few games where Silva was away and Gundogan was preferred to him.	No one is criticising having Fellaini as an option. What they are criticising is the fact that ‘what they’re doing’ doesn’t work so often, after 3 years and so much money spent, that they still have to revert to hoofing it up to Fellaini so frequently. 	soccer	soccer	-1

1774	I sold cars for years and my dad ran a car dealership so I know how everything goes and this past May, my wife and I bought a new car at a dealership I had no affiliation with and it was so frustrating. Everything up until we were in the finance office was great but once we were in there she was trying to play games and the payment was going to be wayyyy higher than what I was told up until then. I was pissed. I am not an angry person and never show much frustration but I balled up the first piece of paper she put in front of me and tossed it across the table at her. We had already discussed everything and there was no need for her to try and squeeze. Ore out of us (for over 2 hours). I got on the phone with the finance guy st my old dealership and he told me the rate I should get. I told her get me close to that (which she had previously said was impossible) or I was leaving. When she said she couldn't we got up to leave and then what do u know, magically she found a bank that would do what we wanted. It was ridiculous.. Then we argued about extended warranties and all that junk for another 30 minutes and eventually we left with our new car. It was worth it in the end since we really did get a killer deal but it was such a pain in the ass dealing with her. My wife told me it the car she had never seen me act like that before lol I was a little proud of myself because I'm not an asshole.. But I was being an asshole to that lady by the end of it for sure. 	Love the car but rarely get to enjoy it. Most of my driving is being stuck in traffic going and coming back from work. 	cars	cars	-1
1775	"Is having premarital sex ""bad?"" Yea, probably. Have lots of Christians including myself done it? Yep. It does not make you any less of a Christian, whether or not you agree with that premise. I'm not here to lecture you, just tell you that I thought the same thing when I was trying to have sex in school, but was baptized as an adult and not raised to have faith.

Also your politics have absolutely nothing to do with your faith. I'm sorry to diverge from the question but this is about the most frustrating thing to me. Be a proud liberal and love Jesus all the same. You don't have to be right-wing to be a good Christian. I firmly believe he'd be a Democrat anyway, albeit most likely a pro-life one.

Back to the youth pastor: This should be a mature conversation between you  two. If he doesn't keep your confidence in this he isn't doing his job very well. Which I suppose is no guarentee, but they need kids to trust them and he would be throwing away that trust."	"lol [Luke 17:3-4]

1777	[Took a quick search around and this seems like it'd be helpful for you.](https://referencehometheater.com/2013/commentary/4k-calculator/) There's a good chart that compares resolutions, screen size and viewing distance to see if you'd benefit from a 4k TV at all. Also, keep in mind resolution isn't the only factor. Backlighting/contrast, color gamut, and other things are equally if not more important. A OLED 1080p TV will blow a regular 4k standard LED TV out of the water in picture quality because of the color and contrast for example. 	I’m always surprised when people that love thrillers tell me they haven’t seen Don’t Breathe so it’s become almost a reflex to say it when people bring up the genre haha. 	movies	movies	-1
1778	For the school library it's not about not wanting to do the work (believe me school librarians do a lot of work and a great job-at least the ones I've worked with in my career as a high school teacher). It's just that well to be blunt, the kids probably wont be interested in them, and they then they have to be approved...right or wrong there are some books not allowed in the school's library.	Look on Ebay for bulk book listings.  Sometimes retiring teachers or others sell boxes of books and show you what is in them.  Scour the shelves at Goodwill/Salvation Army.  Visit your library sales.  The other thing I did when I taught Language Arts is get the Scholastic book flyer and I would buy the $1 books from it.  They have a 6th grade and up flyer so if you have some below level readers that should work for you.  Right now one of the sale items is 6 books for $6 - they are probably more MS level but again it depends on the readers in your class.  Also Call it Courage is $1.  The Bar Code Tattoo is $1 - that is on the Teen flyer.  If you live anywhere near a Scholastic Warehouse, their once a year warehouse sale is amazing.  	books	books	-1

"	"The thought that America can target a greater balance than China can target in retaliation might make someone think that America has an advantage in a tariff war. This kind of thinking disregards that it's Americans buying those goods that are the greater part, so Americans will have to spend more to compensate for their larger consumption needs.

It also ignores that this administration is targeting tariffs globally on a large balance of trade, and that incentivises China, Europe, the rest of Asia, and etc to shift sales away from America to trade among this larger group. "	business	business	-1
1783	DNA is remarkably stable. It is only destroyed by extreme heat, specific enzymatic activity or acidic conditions (with time to destruction decreasing with level of acidity). I'm not a pet food manufacturing expert, but I doubt the processes used in manufacturing would degrade DNA to the point that the species was not detectable. Identifying individual animals in the food would be difficult as I'm assuming there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of animals in there.	"Oh hey! I make hot sauce with TV and Movie references!

1784	"&gt; Modern processors do a really good job with branch prediction, so loop unrolling, for example, is a lot less effective than reducing instruction cache load.

A lot of key unrolls are not about avoiding the branch prediction, it's about being able to use a ""long"" instruction to perform multiple operations in parallel, e.g. when adding two arrays.

&gt; Again, it depends entirely on the specific case, so, as a general rule, you don’t want widespread inlining and unrolling.

Widespread is fuzzy, but ""you don't want widespread inlining"" is fairly nonsensical. Inlining enables tons of other optimizations like const propagation etc. It's basically the most critical optimization there is because many other optimizations cannot be propagated across function boundaries (or any basic block boundary).

There are specific counter examples but most programs will run fastest at O3. Even the phoronix benchmarks that people are throwing around here to try to ""support"" the idea that O3 is sub-optimal, from years ago where compilers didn't leverage inlining as well and processors had smaller icache, have the property that O3 is basically never worse by a significant amount. In some cases it's essentially the same accounting for noise (a tiny bit worse in the graphs), in some cases it's a lot better."	1) Why does anyone care? 2) Are you discouraging anyone? 3) It is in fact rare to see a woman programming and noone should take shit for stating this unfortunate fact	programming	programming	-1

Putting up an anti-adblock wall is none of those things.

Here's the thing, though.  I know of at least two sites that have gone ad-free (other than their own begging for donations, of course), despite not wanting to, not because of adblockers, but because they could NOT live up to that standard when they tried (don't have shitty, frustrating ads, don't host malware) and still make any money, no matter how hard they tried.

1803	"Housing is a good example: investors buy houses, because everyone needs houses and space is limited =&gt; price should always go up. At one point investors take up such a big part of the housing market, driving eachother's prices up, that the people who actually need a house can't afford it anymore. Then their investments aren't worth anything anymore =&gt; bubble pops. 

With student loans it's quite similar: prices go up because ""everyone needs education, right?"" But there will be a point where people won't be able to afford it anymore, not being able to pay back their loans, or just skipping higher education in total. 

When this bubble pops, people who paid thousands in student loans are fucked, people who can't afford their loans are fucked, people who give out student loans are fucked, and the education instances themselves are fucked. At one point ""everyone needs a student loan"" just doesn't hold anymore, and everything that's based on that collapses."

1804	"I think it had some incredibly good base systems. The physics based tools worked well, and they really nailed the sense of adventure by reading their players really well and rewarding ""I wonder if I can..."" kind of mentalities. Cooking was fun, trading was fun, weapons were visually cool, world interactions with your tools was fun, and it just overall had a really solid base.

Unfortunately they were missing any interesting dungeons, the weapon degradation mechanic was not well implemented, the overworld was visually bland in my opinion, and the enemy variety was sorely lacking. The plot was pretty much non-existent and what was there was kinda nonsensical. Combat was serviceable but ultimately didn't maintain interest through the length of the game. The way they designed the last boss fight was weird and unfun, almost punishing you with a weaker boss for doing well. Also the ""boss fights"" were underdesigned slugfests that didn't feel like Zelda bosses at all. With no dungeons, no interesting bosses, a very very small roster of enemies, and no mechanical tool discovery throughout the game..... it really missed the mark as a Zelda game. 

If I had my way, I'd have them cut the map-size down in half, layer it more like LttP was where everything is more tightly wound together and visually distinct, rework the weapon durability systems, cut the orb of power and korok seed puzzles down by at least half and funnel that manpower into making real Zelda style dungeons complete with tool unlocks. The story could be improved as well, though honestly that's not super high on the priority list. I'd be more comfortable with them going the Dark Souls route of doing most of the storybuilding through environments, NPC lore drops, and other forms of passive storytelling with the ""save the princess"" remaining the main thrust.

The depression itself obviously has deeper reasons, but the condition worsens *a lot* because its symptoms make it worse. You are already in a bad spot mentally, and then you stop doing exercise, eat unhealthy food and do other things that affect you mentally (making you feel even more worthless) but also phsically, by having effects on your body chemistry. Then in turn the depression gets worse, the symptoms get worse, and you do even more damage to yourself. It's a vicious cycle. We know exercise, diet and social interaction all play a huge role in depression and yet those are exactly the things that go down the drain once depression hits.

Given that Robb and Stannis both independently came up with the idea to release Jon of his vows, it would seem that is not without precedent. Jon himself allowed himself to covet the offer Stannis made: a hot wife, legitimacy, a lordship. But when he was considering that he made the vow in front of a heart tree and that Stannis and Mel would demand the burning of the Godswood, he realized, when Ghost came to him, that Ghost is of the old gods, just like Jon and Ned, and he couldn't burn the Weirdwood down."

"10 years ago there was a real estate bubble where mortgage lenders would lie to get people who were not qualified approved for mortgages. 

These not qualified people defaulted on their mortgages and lost their homes. 

Often the buyers were not as knowledgeable about home finance as they should have been. And the mortgage lenders were crooks who wanted to sell a bunch of mortgages, put them all together and sell the package as a Collateralized Mortgage Obligation. Basically a big bond. 

When the default rates on these suckers went through the roof, the economy tanked. Lehman went under, unemployment went up. Etc.

"I think you bring up a valid point, and I'm sorry that people have taken offense to your expression of your opinion.

I don't support homosexuality, but as you bring up in your post, it can be challenging to separate the sin from the sinner. I think God calls us to call out the sin, but to love the sinner. 

If you were to see a gay person beaten and bloodied on the side of the road, would you walk by and say that they got what was coming to them? Or would you wrap your cloak around them, give them shelter and help them on their way?

Unfortunately, in today's society gay men and women are often treated as second class citizens. They are beaten, murdered and discriminated against. Even if we disagree with their life choices, I think the Bible teaches us to approach them with kindness and compassion (Love in an Agape sense, not an Eros sense), lest we fall in to legalistic trap that Pharisees and Sadduces fell into. 

What does Jesus say about calling out sin?

 “If your brother or sister\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23743a)\] sins,\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23743b)\] go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.**16** But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23744c)\] **17** If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector""

Secondly, it's super mature and stable. It's as reliable as you can get, and it's also pretty lightweight.

Third, a lot of front-end CSS frameworks use it already, such as Materialize.css and Bootstrap, as well as major platforms like Wordpress. It's just already in or required by so many things.

Those are the big points. Anyone who says ""nobody uses jQuery anymore"" is being an elitist hipster. That's not to say there aren't better frameworks, or the others don't have their place. I LOVE React and Vue and wish I could use them at work sometimes. But, they don't really fit into every scenario (or many scenarios in my situation at work), and it depends on what you're doing on a project.

It affects serotonin levels in your brain so if your brain is used to having it then you cut it off it takes a little bit for you to level back out. That’s my theory. You will feel so much better once you get past those first few days though. I’m not against marijuana by any means. I love it. I just always end up overdoing it and smoking multiple times a day except for when I’m at work. Then when I’m at work I feel weird and almost “high” because I’m used to being high. When being high is my normal then my normal becomes high. If that makes any sense.

I've played Namalsk, I've played most of the maps.

You are being disingenuous if you state it is better than standalone. It has more guns and shit, but it looks like some janky ass PS2 game and plays worse. Basically any other milsim or survival game in the market is a more enjoyable experience than the A2 mod, it's below par for even h1z1 by any objective standards... but diehards who started there are blinded by nostalgia just like people with thousands of hours in standalone but only a few hundred in the mod can't deal with shit graphics and animations. You might prefer it more for sentimental attachment, but it has aged poorly and comparable experiences exist in A3 modded servers but with upgrades to every aspect of the game lol.

I don't play Arena over Skyrim for performance or graphics, I do it (rarely, with Dosbox) for nostalgia, because by all objective metrics Skyrim is a better game. I don't play Fallout 1 instead of 4 for the superior fidelity in graphics, I play it because of the memories. I do not have this nostalgia with the mod, but I do with the standalone, and the mod is gross in comparison to A3 mods or DayZ standalone or any number of other games. I would like to sincerely suggest you give a try to some games that are not dead mods of nearly decade old titles. :p

The gameplay loop of the mod doesn't even really resemble that of the standalone that much. Gear is just shat out everywhere in the A2 mod. Feels like PUBG with less looting, shittier graphics, less weapon customization, shittier gunplay.

If you make it sound generic, like you do in your profile (based on memory since I can't see the link anymore), it just sounds like you like to travel and come off as generic.  If you have interesting/unique stories, tell them or hint at them. Don't focus on them for your entire profile.  Focus on what shows your personality with interesting tid bits thrown in.  If you have travelling stories that show your personality in a couple sentences, then do it by all means! If you just say ""I went to a super bowl"", it's not interesting.  Most people can go to a super bowl, it's about having money to afford the tickets.  If you met the quarterback of the winning team and had a beer with him, now that's something to tell (or something else interesting).

"First of all, I think the czech dude got some things a little wrong, I agree. I'm from Germany by the way, not that that really matters, but I wanted to mention it in order to give a little weight to my point, because it's not unreasonable Germany-bashing from somebody feeling fucked over by the EU.
Germany heavily subsidizes its agriculture, especially livestock farming on a super industial level. So much in fact, that there is too much manure in germany, which gets dumped on farming land and is a problem for the groundwater, causing nitrate pollution in some of the agriculture-heavy parts of germany. (seriously wtf)
Another thing is, that workforce from eastern europe is extremely cheap, so they basically just pour in cheap labor for work in these big fat meat plants and pay them next to nothing for chopping up like 100 cows a day. (compared to normal german pay, especially if you talking social benefits, since germany has pretty much crossed that out for people working low wage jobs (i'm paraphrasing here a little but germany doesnt really hand out too much for free))
That's why (coupled with the benefits due to the euro) a rich country like germany can actually UNDERCUT meat prices in romania etc., which is pretty fucked up when you think about it. So we basically pollute our own country in order to screw over the rest in industrial lifestock farming.

As someone also in audio design something remarkable about the Zelda serious is how well the sound design is. Some players have played Zelda titles blindfolded because of how different the sounds are in the game. There's a difference depending on what link is walking on as far as even grass and dirt. Hitting a weapon on various objects will also result in different sounds. 


This might seem pretty simple but a lot of AAA titles don't take those things into account. If a attack something in most games it's going to result in the same sound in stone or metal, if it even changes at all across some environments.

My beef is that this issue is always framed in the media as a polarizing ""gender representation"" issue.  While the genders are in fact not evenly represented in all things, there is no evidence to suggest that an even representation between genders is a benefit to anyone.  Meanwhile we have gender-based affirmative action programs, for example the ongoing push for more women in STEM-related fields.  The data seems to suggest that these programs are fighting against gravity.

1920	"&gt;The problem stems from the definition of the word god. If that was narrowed in some way, then atheism would mean something.

I agree.

&gt;I reject the notion that the word god should just apply to whatever someone decides it applies to. If we limit that, we can get some good definition for atheism.

The problem is if we reject it, then we are going to miss out on some arguments. I think Aquinas' arguments are strong, and the common atheist counter arguments seem to me to miss the point. Failure to consider the argument as it was made, rather than as we choose to understand it, means that not only are we missing out on a good point, we're reinforcing the idea that the ""other side"" (from both perspectives) are wrong and fundamentally incapable of reason when really we're just chosen subtly different definitions. 

I don't think nature or logic owes us a useful definition of atheism. If we're committed to truth, we should see where the rabbit hole goes, not reject it merely because it places our favourite label in a sensitive position. "	I’m not a religious person, so I cannot speak for religious people. But to me, belief in a God cannot be objectively deserved. Religion exists because enough people want it to, and it’s organized around standardized practices, doctrine, beliefs, etc. Whereas it can stand absent of empirical evidence, it does have real effects on the lives of real people. If faith does good in those people’s lives, then I do think it deserves to exist. Where the problem lies, is when these beliefs are mistaken for objectives truths. And when those beliefs are used to influence policy, wars, even the way we treat other human beings. I think it’s important to recognize faith for what it is—belief without evidence. And for religious people to respect that faith is personal, but that this doesn’t make it any less beautiful.

1925	"One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.

Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess. You'll also have a higher brain/body ratio, so you get that cognition/ratio correlation."	Well, that is true for any thrust reversal device.

While most of what the author says regarding programming languages and C++ rings true to me, I disagree with the issues of capturing by reference in lambdas.

Sure, if you return a lambda which captured something by reference in the function stack you are going to have problems. However, this is a relatively obvious code defect for a reviewer."	"That’s why I mentioned running under a modern-ish init system. Most programs written by most people do not run on routers. Also, it is possible to write a relatively simple wrapper to daemonize a foreground program (even handling writing pid files), but once a program daemonizes, it’s much harder (maybe impossible?) to bring it back into the foreground.

To be clear, if you know you must daemonize, then it’s good that a simple library exists to facilitate it.

1929	"&gt; So it's said a lot that free will exists, and that we are not ""predetermined"" to act a certain way, and God didn't want to create ""robots"". That because of this, he is not responsible for our actions despite creating us. But is this really an option? 

  
No. Even under compatibilism God would have full control of what constitutes an agent's nature. In short, he could have created men such that they always *freely* choose good things. Which there is no logical problem with. Jesus is an example of a person who always freely chose good things. Angels are beings that presumably always freely choose good things; except for that one guy who used his freedom to rebel. But in Satan's case again, God created him such that he would freely choose evil. He had full control of what constituted his nature, just like Jesus, just like angels, just like humans. So again whether or not we view it as ""robots"" or beings with free will in a deterministic universe, God is still responsible.   


There is room for randomness creating ""freedom"", but it's not clear what value randomness would be to God or how it's really 'free' in any meaningful way that would be relevant to moral responsibility.   


&gt; So my question is, what is it about our decision making process that makes us have free will, and what is it about the robot exactly that makes it so that they lack free will? 

  
Nothing if we accept compatibilism (presuming the robots are sufficiently conscious and have a ""nature"" to act according to).   


&gt; It's generally accepted that robots do not and despite future advances would not have free will.

"&gt; The author also gets double entry accounting confused. Double entry isn't a recording of accounting by the buyer and seller. It means that for every transaction, you create two lines - a debit and a credit. 

Oh, yeah. I let that one go because I didn't think it through and figured that hey, technically indirectly it amounts to the same thing as the author described when everyone goes from single-entry accounting to double-entry accounting... but it doesn't even do that, of course: If the starting position is that everyone has a single record of each exchange they're involved in, then for each exchange, obviously the buyer and seller already have their own separate records. Switching to double-entry accounting does double the amount of entries representing each exchange, but only by splitting entries in each participant's ledger.

1932	"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, and I’m not sure if I am even posting this correctly as I’m very new to reddit, but I’m Looking for thoughts and/or advice.

My husband and I have been married for about 10 years and we have one 6 year old child together. I have always wanted a somewhat large family,  consisting of 3 or 4 kids. My husband has always been adamant on just 2 kids. Before we got married we had several talks about me wanting 3 or 4, and him wanting just two, so I decided that I could be happy with just two. 

We spent the first four years of our marriage making sure we were where we wanted to be professionally and financially before we welcomed our son into our family. Pregnancy was wonderful, labor and birth went pretty flawless, and honestly we had a happy healthy, mostly easy baby! I was no where ready to have a second child right away, but knew that one day I did want another one. 

When our son turned two I found myself ready to have another one. I brought it up to my husband, and he said he wasn’t ready yet. I gave it some time, maybe 6 months, and brought it up again, he still said not yet. This process went on for 3 years. At this point our first child was 5 and I was beginning to get frustrated, and that’s when my husband told me that he no longer wanted a second child, he just wanted the one. 

Hearing that he only wanted one felt pretty heartbreaking to me. I can honestly see some of his points, but still want a second. His points are 1. Kids are expensive. 2. He wants to travel and give our son experiences that he doesn’t think we can do with two kids. 3. He likes that our son is older and is becoming more independent and he doesn’t want to go back to having a baby rely on him. 4. He doesn’t think he can handle two children, that it would be double the noise, toys, clothes, money, and so on.

I just feel a bit lost, and have tried to do some research into it, and have found that it boils down to me having to choose him, or another baby. Can I be happy with what I have, or is it worth leaving him to hopefully “complete” a family elsewhere. Honestly, I’m not happy with either scenario. I’m not going to leave him over this, but it’s just really hurtful that he gets to make a major life decision for “us” with out me agreeing, and that he went back on our agreement when I already showed compromise when I agreed to go from 3/4 down to 2. 

I’m just looking for advice or maybe someone who has been in this same situation who can give me some insight or help me with these feelings. I’m worried that I will deeply regret not having a 2nd kid, and will end up resenting him for it. Thanks in advance. "	Just thought I would reply.

Not really, but my cats are a lot smaller than my American furballs, both in being overweight (only one is) and in general size. But mine are all street cats or random mixes, most of what you see online from Japan are mostly purebreeds. 

The most popular cat here is the Scottish Fold, and since many of them don’t get the “food” gene, and you can’t breed 2 folded cats together healthily, you have a lot of unfolded Fold ears. But the other trademark of the breed is their large, round faces that seem to be really curious and adorable. So likely, most of them are a Fold without the ears, and that leads to it. 

Most cats here, too, are either indoor cats, so rather curious with new things, or outdoor cats that are more like neighborhood cats that get fed by a particular person. So you’re mostly seeing the indoor cats, too. 

Finally, cat owners here are crazy. When you spend hundreds or thousands on getting your cat (and finding apartments that let you have cats is hard as hell. Small dogs, no problem. Cats?

1936	"You sound familiar enough with Brazilian corruption.  My understanding is that the previous president was imprisoned because of an accounting trick that prior administrations did.  Something akin to how US unemployment isn't the actual number of people without jobs, just the number still drawing unemployment.  My understanding of the Lula corruption trial is that it was all about a remodeled condo that they couldn't even prove he owned.  Judicial tricks were performed to keep him imprisoned and even the UN came down against his imprisoning.  

People definitely need to understand the how prevalent corruption is and how it's been the way business got done, right or wrong.  Brazil isn't far removed from the days of military dictatorships but memories seem short.  Bolsonaro seems a nightmare but it'll be compounded by the world's capitalists that will take advantage of his policies and reap whatever natural goods are left in Brazil (the Amazon).

1943	"Irrelevant because ""charitable spending"" can easily exist without religion. The good actions of an organization don't outweigh the bad ones. The Catholic church is using the free, untaxable income they get to protect and cover for child molesters. There is no excuse for this. It doesn't matter how much they spend charitably. They still harm children and have negatively harmed thousands of lives.

So, people that willingly give money to the church are saying, ""I'm okay with my money being used to protect child molesters."" And the church can get away with it because they don't have to disclose where their money goes or how it is used. It's disgusting and immoral and no amount of charity work can change that.

So, any organization that donates or is charitable shouldn't be held accountable for any crimes or harm they do because they might have a net positive influence in the world?

Ori is a very linear experience. While the structure is open and you can backtrack, the rewards are usually just standard expansions; you're moving from zone to zone in the intended order and backtracking only if you want to. I'd almost argue that Ori isn't a Metroidvania, as little would change if they snubbed the small side paths and moved the upgrades to the main route—it's less about exploration but more about seeing the setpieces and visuals they've built. Not a knock against the game, just a description.

Hollow Knight really digs into the open structure. The game doesn't give you a whole lot of direction so you're left to explore it for yourself. The structure is so light that players will often take pretty dramatically different routes throughout the game, and each unexplored nook can be anything: it might be a small upgrade, it might be a major upgrade, it might be an entirely new zone. There's something of an intended path, but it's more likely that you'll stumble upon it rather than be told.

The real question is ""How likely is it that getting a restraining order will increase the level of violence, and how likely is it that it will precipitate a lethal situation, when one was not likely previously?""

It's not the whole data set that matters, it's the likelihood of turning shouting into physical abuse, and physical abuse into homicide, on a case by case basis.

We're Asian so parents living with their eldest son isn't unusual in Asia but in America it's considered as not being independent and could be a deal breaker. The main reason why I want them to live with me is ever since we moved here (1997) my parents have never made a combined salary of over 45k. For that reason they still to this day work 7 days a week with each of them working 10+ hours. As a result they have never taken a day off except for when my grandpa passed away where they took a week off. We have a small business that's just doing ok. For those reasons I feel like I owe them big time and also because I had the privilege of growing up here too. Also, my dad told his dad to live with us in America, in which he did.  


My question is, how would that affect my life as a whole?  Would my dating life be ruined? Assuming I reach financial stability once I get a job, would that change things?

1976	"It only matters if I want to make the claim *the biggest reason why there aren't as many women in gaming as men is because of the belligerent community.* If you would like to reread our conversation, that is not my argument. I'm saying there exist women who shy away from the community because it's belligerent. And that's a shame, and we should try to fix it.

Now, I was anticipating the ""but the same applies to men"" argument, and I don't disagree. I'm distancing myself from the league community for the same reason, and I'm a dude. What I think we can all agree on though is that women are disproportionately affected by this because a significant part of the toxicity is specifically aimed at women, particularly those who speak up about it or voice things which (some) men don't like. This is also my response to your last point. This isn't *just* about toxicity in general, although it also is. If you would scroll back to the original tweet you were arguing against, this is about toxicity specifically toward women. I'm trying to avoid the word because of the ensuing baggage, but yes - sexism. Both are worth fighting against. 

And before this train of argument continues, *yes* there probably also exists toxicity specifically against men, *yes* that should be opposed as well. I would argue less than against women, and I'm sure lots of people would agree. But even if you don't, *fighting one of these does not exclude the other.* *These are not mutually exclusive.* *They do not even oppose each other.* *They complement each other.* So ""this also happens to men"" is not a reason not to do something about any of this. It's all the more reason to start *somewhere* instead of arguing ""let's not to do anything about it.""

(I would just like to quickly note that your last statement only makes sense assuming women and men are equally prone to toxicity. I don't plan on arguing about that because it's not relevant for my point and I haven't made up my mind on that, but it is worth thinking about. Just an aside.)"

Child labor isn't a moral issue, it's a survival issue. There are incredibly poor parts of the world where the children have to work or the family doesn't eat. Is that immoral? I've yet to encounter a compelling argument. As noble as a law against child labor appears, if that family needs the child's production to eat that day, what does that law achieve other than make it more difficult for that family to survive? What eliminates child labor isn't government laws but worker productivity. As parents become more productive their compensation increases which allows them to spend some of that additional income on not sending their children to work.

&gt; commercial sex-trafficking (which there definitely is a market for)

This I think requires some additional clarification on your part for what you exactly mean by sex-trafficking. Prostitution is humanity's oldest profession. Prostitution is illegal most everywhere in the US, however pornography is not. So it's illegal for Frank to pay Susan for sex but if Jason pays Frank and Susan and they agree to have it filmed, the whole thing is legal. 

&gt; without government to regulate that you end up with polluted lakes and rivers, global warming, endangered species, etc 

Whomever owns the now-polluted lakes and rivers in your scenario would have a claim for damages against the polluter. Climate change is a bit different, I agree, since the damages are nearly impossible to measure until they've already happened and then to figure out who's liable even more difficult. That said, I think there's a tremendous amount of fabricated hysteria surrounding climate change and, as you allude to, it doesn't follow that government intervention will result in a better outcome.

It's just that it's probably the reason that such bland sound ever got any recognition considering the kind of band they are is a dime a dozen."	"Grocery stores also used to offer store charge - it was actually really common. In the small town I grew up in, by the early 2000s the stores had long since stopped offering it... except for a handful of existing customers who maintained accounts and had been shopping there for decades. My family - who had been local family farmers since the 1950s - was one of those customers! We moved off the farm in the 90s but continued to shop there and the store let us keep using the farm’s charge account. 

As a teenager (from about 2004-2010) I could walk into the grocery store down the hill from our house and get basically whatever I wanted. At checkout I’d just say the magic words “can I have a charge slip?”. The longtime staff knew the drill, the new seasonal kids would get completely confused before finding the stack of carbon copy paper deep underneath the register. 

I’d write the corporate name of our farm, something like “Flower Creek Farm” (not the real name) and the four digit account number “2147” (that’s the real number!) and sign it.

Answer me this. 10+ years ago, we had DRM. Far worse than Denuvo tbh. How many people do you legitimately think have been heavily affected, first by having a regular desire to play 10+ year old games, and then by the inability of those games to work?

Literally the operating system those games were made for is a bigger barrier to entry when it comes to getting a game to work. It's absolutely complaining for the sake of complaining. It's a nonsense point based on assuming the absolute worst possible outcome, because people want to complain. It's so blatantly obvious to see for anyone that isn't hung up on needing everything to be some anti-industry circlejerk and some principled stance. It is absolutely not a reasonable standpoint in anyway but subs like this seem to thrive on constantly overreacting about everything so that is hardly surprising. 

""I want to play games on the move when I might not have a connection and DRM might impede that so I won't buy it"" = Reasonable standpoint. 

""This game I can buy and play without issue has a small chance that some point in the future, 10+ years down the line, might not be playable, despite the fact that its incredibly unlikely, so I'm not buying it"" = Completely irrational standpoint.

**Ruiner:** Just subscribed to humble bundle and glad I did.  I wouldn't likely have bought this anytime soon otherwise. There is an overworld to run around it when not in a mission and really thank god for that. With action games like this I need my breaks and this game is pretty well paced. Even during missions it isn't constant action. It uses the recognizable game design trope of killing everybody in a locked room before you can move forward. What makes it work so well is that you get a score for every room and then you can recycle all the weapons the enemies dropped for ""karma"" which you use to upgrade your stats and abilities. Then after that you walk around for a bit before the next ""kill everybody in a locked room"" scenario. Sometimes it's just goons. Sometimes it's a boss fight.

The only other tax that has a remotely similar historical use, is tariffs. Again, not paid by those in poverty.

If you'd roll back to 200 years ago you would not find a good capitalist country because none existed.

Key ingredient to weight loss is diet, have you been disciplined at your food intake? Exercise only help that little bit, it's always no effect if you don't eat clean.

I exercise 6 days a week and no I did not lose much weight because I eat shit a lot. But anyway, rule of thumb: no processed food (like packaged food), replace white rice with better carbs (lower GI carbs) like sweet potatoes, some fruits, vegetables, lean meat, eggs etc. Snack nuts or fruits when hungry. And also cut down and don't purposely add salt into your food when not necessary. Too much salt causes water retention and make you looks rounder.

Also add weight training to your routine. It increases muscle and in turn, it helps you burn more calories. Muscle need energy. More muscle means higher energy burn.

Investors really, really want to see them be profitable, so with a somewhat limited production capacity it makes craptons of sense for them to continue to sell the high-margin models instead of the low margin ones. When they can put out 10k cars a week, then totally release the low end models. As it stands right now though, they're still collecting phenomenal amounts of LR + AWD model orders, and with them being a relatively high-margin product, then why not? It makes the low end model a little more profitable as they continue to scale and fine-tune their production process. Battery tech keeps getting cheaper and cheaper, and studies have shown the base model 3 is a $20,000 car with a $10,000 battery.

2023	"&gt; So if I start with a worldview and infer from the world information according to my worldview, then that inferred information cannot be correct or should be treated as false?

It will probably have some intense bias. Plus you're putting the cart before the horse. Worldviews are created by experience, the world you live in shapes your views.

&gt; All the evidence as in all things able to be observed by man? Ins't that a big expansive? I have to see everything that exists before I am able to come to the conclusion I have?

No, obviously not. Good thing others have done a lot of work for you already. You could start with the falsifiable claims your religion makes and see if those hold up. Then maybe continue with it's philosophical claims and see if those make sense.

&gt; But isn't that just you parroting their appeals to ridicule? ""It's only an appeal to ridicule fallacy if I disagree with it.""

No, that's not what I'm saying. If a claim is so preposterous and contrary to what we know to be correct, it's excusable for people to not take that claim seriously. Example: Flat Earthers.

&gt; I have not seen such a demonstration. I've seen theory crafting and massive extensions of ideas into areas they have not been observed. I have seen nothing to convince me that all life mutated from a single life form

Might I suggest r/Evolution and r/DebateEvolution for excellent sources?
&gt; nor that life was formed by non-living material.

You are aware that theories about abiogenesis are not included in the theory of evolution and are in fact an entirely different branch of science?

&gt; Because I don't believe it is equally evidenced.

I don't believe you have a good grasp on the theory of evolution.

&gt;  I have witnessed natural selection in action. I have not witnessed macro-evolution in action

You are aware that macro-evolution doesn't exist? It's a term used and abused by anti-science apologists.

&gt; You can flail about all you like demanding that they be considered the same thing, but you're not going to convince me with said flailing.

Flailing? Do you know the [analogy of the colored text](https://i.imgur.com/oAnfA.jpg)?

&gt; I'm not obligated to believe all life mutated from a single celled organism just because you can show how a beetle can change the color of its wings or how a finch can change the size of its beak.

You do know there are a TON of books on diversification of eukaryotes? Also, why are your standards of evidence so unreasonable? You'll believe religious claims with no evidence but plenty of evidence against it, but not scientific claims with plenty of evidence FOR it?

&gt;  No amount of you insisting that they are the same will suffice. I have not seen any convincing evidence to suggest that macro-evolution as described by evolutionists happened.

Macro-evolution, Evolutionists...Looks like your well got poisoned. Maybe you should go FIND the evidence for evolution, it's really easily accessible. And while you're at it, you should also go read TalkOrigins, because you've been lied to by apologists and pseudoscientists.

&gt; Where did I do that? Was it where I said that I don't believe in evolution?

You do believe in speciation and mutation, but a bunch of mutations over a very long time is just too much?

&gt; Also, so you are ok with arguments that contain zero reasoning as long as you can google the reasoning? You are ok with people not presenting arguments if it is 'common knowledge' that their point is automatically true?

I would just google the reasoning. It's probably going to be clearer than what most people can put down in words anyway.
Let's say I'm in a discussion about truth and someone mentions Tarski's semantic theory.  I'm not going to expect them to explain the entire theory to me, but that doesn't make their point necessarily right. 

&gt; So what you're saying is that anyone who believes differently from you simply hasn't looked hard enough? That is the only possible explanation for why people believe differently from you? Everyone else that believes in anything that you don't believe is simply being biased and hasn't 'tried' hard enough?

No, that's a strawman. I believe that **you personally** haven't looked hard enough, which I inferred from your lack of knowledge on the theory of evolution, and simply faulty ideas about it.

&gt; And would it be wrong for me to think the same of you and your standards of evidence then?

You haven't caught me in an error yet. 

&gt; Ok then, how about aquatic fossils on mountain tops or otherwise above sea level? 

You do realise those mountaintops used to be ocean floors, and that the dating of the fossils and geological strata of the mountains line up?
How do you think mountains are formed?

&gt; How is it that these findings do not support the possibility of a global flood?

Because we have WAY better fitting naturalistic explanations with EVIDENCE. 
Oh, and because flood myths don't line up with anything. Because they're fictional. Unless you want to start moving the goalposts and have this flood last as long as multiple millenia?

&gt; There is a difference between 'science' and the scientific community. Both are wildly different. For example, you yourself would not be part of 'science', but rather the scientific community. Science doesn't need to use rescuing devices to maintain its belief because science is not a person nor an entity.

I ment that 'rescuing device' is not a scientific term. Cognitive bias would be a better word. But no matter what word you use, such things can be overcome, both personally, by scepticism to your own beliefs, and scientifically, by controls and reviews.

&gt; No, I've seen them.

And that automatically implies EVERYONE has them?

&gt;  When I provide evidence or arguments for the existence of God, instead of falsifying or show how they are wrong, instead the other person tends to just try to explain it away.

That means the evidence or arguments can be used to support alternative hypotheses, and thus, are not good evidence or arguments for your claim.

&gt; For example, to say that fine-tuning is not evidence for a designer because fine-tuning can also be explained by a multi-verse. 

So? Fine-tuning of the universe isn't even real. They were generous enough to give you an alternative option with more parsimony even though they could have just shown you that fine-tuning is nonsense.

&gt;  This is then used as reasoning for rejecting fine-tuning as evidence. 

Well, yeah. If two hypotheses are equally supported by the same evidence, you'll need other evidence to support one of the two hypotheses.

&gt; If any possible alternative explanation is found, then the pro-God explanation is tossed out and considered 'not evidence'.

Correct, because a postulate of 'god' is about the least parsimonious you can get.

&gt; Unless the bias is systemic. Scientists =/= science.

There are anti-bias components SPECIFICALLY in the systematic enterprise of the scientific method.
But you can check that out very easily. Does the shit science give us WORK? Like, cars, computers, vaccines, medicine, preservatives, plastics, solar panels etc?
If the answer is yes, they must be doing something right, because the creation of all those things are based on scientific theories.

&gt; What does this have to do with rescuing devices?

If other people keep proving you wrong, the rescuing device might keep working for you, but everyone else will move on.

&gt; Also, I don't believe that. Nowadays suggesting something that the majority of scientists disagree with just gets you shunned and called out.

Bullshit. You might get called out to support your suggestion, i.e. put up or shut up, but you're not going to get shunned unless you're dishonest in your work.

&gt; If the scientific community at large doesn't want to believe what you are suggesting, then they will work towards silencing you.

That's a lie perpetuated by pseudoscientists that don't get taken seriously. ""They're silencing me OMG!"" No, you're just full of shit. 

&gt; It has happened in the past and it would be naive to think it doesn't happen in the present.

Oh, like how Darwin got ridiculed? The truth will come out at some point in such situations, there isn't a great conspiracy of scientists, they all work to find out what's correct.

It's also naïve to assume that your worldview is correct and that scientists are just suppressing it.

&gt; Truth and falsehood have obvious meanings. 

No, they don't. That's my entire point here. 

&gt;  The one I question is belief. What does it mean to believe something? 

An acceptance that something is correct or factual.

&gt; Am I a believer of something simply by asking myself ""Do I believe this?"" and answering ""Yes.""? 

No, because you're not using the underlying reasons for your belief. ""Do I believe this?"" ""Yes, because of X, Y and Z reasons""

&gt; Apart from that, what can be observed within a person that shows that they are a believer of something?

Nothing, you can't observe mental states (yet). All you can do is to compare their actions and words with their professed belief and see if it holds up.

&gt; Is it only a willful insistence that marks a person as somebody who believes something?

It's primary, but only by the words and actions of that person can you conclude if they believe in something or only profess to believe in something.

2033	I'm trying not to give into to confirmation bias but this is exactly what I was thinking. running with what I'm reading here, Ive been looking at the failure state of various semiconductors and transformers. Given in 2018 a major event wouldn't be sneaking up on us, I think the problems could be mitigated. 	"Computer Science Major Here: 

We cool modern processors not to make them more efficient, but so that the microchips do not get damaged by excessive heat.   All electronic devices create waste heat based on the wattage of the device.  Do you have a [65W CPU?](https://ark.intel.com/products/88196/Intel-Core-i7-6700-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_00-GHz)  Then you have to dissipate that heat safely via a heat sink (usually aluminum or copper with lots of fins and a fan to move heat from the chip into the air) or maybe a water cooling block (water is circulated through a metal block pressed on the processor, then through a radiator that transfers the heat to the air).  

To 'overclock' a processor doesn't make it more efficient, but makes it faster.  In fact, this often requires that you put *more electricity into the chip than it was designed to carry*.  This causes even more heat to be generated and so even more exotic heat management systems must be used to keep the CPU cool (like a refrigeration system or simply pouring liquid nitrogen directly on the chip).  Think of this as a drag racer vs a Prius.  The drag racer will leave the Prius in the dust, but guzzles gallons of fuel, while the Prius sips ounces.  The Prius is efficient.  The drag racer is fast. 

Wires or traces on a circuit board do gain more resistance as they heat up, meaning that they are slightly worse at transmitting electricity the hotter they are.  But this doesn't really come into effect very much at the temperature that computers operate.  The cooling is there to prevent outright destruction of the chip, not as a means for efficiency.

The last thing to note is that many computers have what's called 'thermal throttling'.  If the system detects it's chips are getting too hot, it will either slow them down (reducing the amount of electricity going through them and thus reducing heat) or completely shut down the system to prevent damage.  This mostly affects laptops (which are thin and have thinner heat sinks and can get dust, hair and junk in their cooling systems from being on your lap, couch or in coffee shops).  This is the only cooling issue that would affect normal users.  It's either working as intended, or slowed down.  Unless you're messing with overclocking, more cooling will not increase performance or efficiency in a noticeable way."	askscience	askscience	-1

B: I don't call my mom on the phone.

B: (pause)...because she is dead.

Luckily she is a really nice person, and she knew it was an honest mistake, but she wanted to fuck with me a little hence the smile and the dramatic pause before she told me.

Alternative hypotheses

Further information: Alternatives to general relativity
Because dark matter remains to be conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. Many hypotheses suggest that the theory of general relativity may simply be incorrect in describing these phenomena. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The most well-known theories of this class are MOND and its relativistic generalization TeVeS,[132] f(R) gravity[133] and entropic gravity.[134] Alternative theories abound.[135][136]

A problem with alternative hypotheses is that the observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the ""observational evidence"" section above). Any alternative hypothesis not only has to explain all the evidence, it also has to explain individual cases such as the Bullet Cluster,[137] wherein observations indicate that the location of the center of mass is far away from the center of baryonic mass.[138] Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.[139][140][141]

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is that while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.[142]"	askscience	askscience	-1

No where in the article does it criticize Islam or Muslims, nor does the comment you replied to.  The biggest problem surrounding Islamophobia is that we can't have a serious discussion about it, because every time people are quick to call people racists and bigots for simple criticism.  Why the hell shouldn't I be able to criticize it?  There are ideas and beliefs in Islam that seriously contradict with western values, and we as a country need to have a discussion of how we want to handle those contradictions.  We can't just pretend they don't exist. 

I know it's a played out metaphor, but if you were living in Nazi Germany would you not feel its your right to criticize Nazism?  If the government took a hard stance against anti-Nazi rhetoric (which it did), would you not feel like your right to free speech was violated?

2074	"First: I Was A Toe-Breaking Tantrum Thrower.

Second - your sister and Mom are overly indulgent Aunt and Grandma.  As others have noted, this is the prime year for tantrum throwing.  You give into it, you have a problem for many years to come.

2077	"In other news the United States continues to defend its dominion over Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, Israel's expansion into more and more of Palestine, the Golan Heights, etc. ... This has nothing to do with justice or defense of international law. It is a cynical power play, pure and simple. Our government will not let this tiny region go because it's world dominance since WWII has operated in significant part on the mafia principle-- if you defy the world's leading imperial power, you are made an example of. US policy planners' greatest fear, since what they called the ""unipolar moment"" (in which after the fall of the Soviet Union we became the undisputed singular superpower in the global geostrategic power balance) is that one of the rising powers (Russia and China) will be seen to be able to challenge our dominance and to become a competing rival like the USSR was. 

I don't agree with Russia's annexation of Crimea, because I'm against all imperialism, period, but surely people can see how ironic and hypocritical this is... Especially because of the context of *why* Russia is particularly interested in pushing back its border with Ukraine, which happens to never get reported in the neo-Red Scare that the mainstream media has going... See, during the Cold War we created a military alliance called NATO that we claimed was there to counter the threat of Soviet influence in the world (the Warsaw Pact). Well, we made an agreement with Soviet Russia that if they allowed Germany to be reunified under a hostile military alliance (NATO, the West) then we would never expand NATO ""one inch to the East."" So they reunified Germany under NATO. Then we betrayed that deal. We expanded NATO East through Poland, and eventually through Ukraine, which is to say *right up to Russia's border.* Surely if Russia betrayed a deal with us and expanded a hostile military alliance to include Canada or Mexico, we would take that as a form of aggression-- a sign that they were posturing for action against us. I mean, we could have missile systems, including nuclear weapons, in any NATO power, so in Ukraine they could be just kilometers from Russia's border. So Russia has every incentive to push the border back, to make some buffer region between NATO and Moscow. It is not, as the media portrays it, just the insane actions of an irrational or wildly expansionist mad-man. 

As I said, I still oppose the action on ethical grounds, but I also oppose all of the imperialist actions that the US is taking and enabling throughout the world on a daily basis, which if you look into it is quite a lot. At any rate, if we care about reality and truth we have to actually look at historical context, motive, and both sides of the situation, and when we do, the situation is very different than the neoconservative hawks would like us to believe. This is a nuanced situation and in some ways we have been the aggressor and instigator historically. 

All of this saber-rattling and propagandizing strikes me as very alarming-- it's the same thing we've done before every war in the last 50-60 years. We start painting some world leader as the new Hitler, the ultimate enemy of everything good in the world, and then we either foment a coup against them, or impose brutal sanctions that kill hundreds of thousands of people and/or get them into debt bondage so we can impose neoliberal structural adjustment policies to economically strangle them, or if everything else fails we just militarily invade like we did in Vietnam, and Iraq, and Afghanistan, and so on. This is why the few remaining states in the world which defy the American-dominated imperial world system that we have constructed are so defensive... They have seen what has happened in the last 17 years, where we've picked off one government after another after another, and they don't want to be next. This is why they're so desperate for nuclear weapons-- they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein after he gave up his WMDs, Qaddafi after he gave up his WMDs, and now is happening to Assad because he gave up his WMDs, and they think that a nuclear arsenal is the one deterrent that could actually prevent us from taking action against them. This also explains what the few chosen enemies of the US have in common as opposed to our allies. It certainly isn't that they're anti-democratic, because we support and ally with dozens of anti-democratic, dictatorial states. It isn't that they don't respect human rights-- our closest allies are Saudi Arabia! They crucify and behead people, only just recently (on paper) started to allow women to drive, they torture and are massacring people in Yemen, and they finance ISIS... What our enemies have in common is that they have been the ones who tried to operate in some way independently from the US' imperial global capitalist system. 

You can take what I say with a grain of salt, because I know it's not the narrative you're used to hearing. But do some research from sources that aren't corporations, the State Department/Pentagon/CIA, or right-wing think tanks and I think you'll find that I'm telling the truth. And before anyone says the inevitable ""You're a Kremlin agent"" (even though I explicitly condemn Russia's actions) or a ""Trump supporter,"" because I know it's inescapable if you question the validity of this narrative, I am very left-wing. I hate Trump, I hate Putin's brand of autocratic nationalism. And equally I detest the neocons in liberals' clothing that the DNC and politicians like Hillary Clinton now represent. I am as biased as anyone, but on this very partisan issue I am not biased in favor of any of the parties involved, but rather in favor of international law, democracy, and anti-imperialism. At least I wear my biases on my sleeve so that the reader can know where I'm coming from and take that as they may, unlike some people who would try to convince you otherwise. I would encourage you not to just uncritically accept the propaganda of any state (or corporation for that matter). I know it takes a lot of effort to dig past all the punditry and talking points to actually look at the evidence, but unfortunately these days that is the only way of learning anything about the world we're living in."

The Feds via FCC basically said its not the federal governments place to manage ISPs. But any area they relinquish authority over can be taken up by the states. And since ISPs by their nature are local, even if the company is national, the local government will have a lot of say in this.

Which, honestly, is where the solution should be anyway as its where the problem came from anyway.

*A fanfiction by ermonas*

Emily 10 was watching Bill on a viewscreen. Her eyes, fixed on the man sitting on a bench in a park, reflected a sad feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia for a time she never lived.

Emily 10 never recovered from what happened to Emily 6. Watching her clone-sister's mind disappear to be replaced with a 5 year old version of her prime was something she just couldn't bear. She wanted to escape, far away, in both time and space. She wanted to be with Bill.

After staring for too long into the viewscreens, Emily 10 was walking by the desolated streets of the red planet when she saw a sign on the door of the Time Travel company: ""90% discount in all travels, just for today"".

She hopped in and asked to be sent to Bill's time. But something went wrong. After she was transported, instead of being with Bill, Emily 10 found herself staring at the eyes of a giant banana, who was just as bewildered as she was.

""RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"", the banana screamed in a high pitched voice, while moving her aside and racing with no clear direction. Emily 10 became even more confused, but soon she saw the reason the banana was so scared: The world was literally falling apart behind them.

Emily 10 ran as fast as she could, but her deteriorations made the task impossible to her: She simply couldn't coordinate the movements needed to run. She saw a giant hole behind her, and was sucked in with an imposible force. She was floating. She saw nothing, felt nothing, and thought she was dead.

But then, in the distance, she heard something. Something that sounded strange, like some sort of foreign or made-up language. But she could still somehow understand the words...

*""HELLO NIGEL""*

That's what she heard."	Hey Dr_Mick!  I'm super interested in your line of work.  I'm currently going to school with the goal of MFT and some sort of PhD.  Do you have any advice for me?

TUA fits his offense better than Lawerence fits Clemson’s. Clemsons offense a lot like Auburn’s operates best when they have a true dual threat quarterback. By true dual threat I mean a guy that not only is a focal point in the run game, but an above average to elite passer to go with it. Bryant was a good runner, but couldn’t pass. Lawerence will be able to operate the game from a passing standpoint, but in the end will become a one dimensional offense because of the lack of quarterback run threat. I do think Lawerence is the better option over Bryant, but I don’t think they will be able to beat Alabama without the threat of the quarterback run. In both games against Alabama Watson carried the ball 20+ times and even though the rushing stats were not mind blowing it kept Alabama from pinning its ears back on early downs. Trevor Lawerence will be able to make all the throws Watson could, but I’m interested to see how he will do if he is consistently put in third and long situations with an O-Line that Alabama has abused for 3 years outside of the 4 th quarter game in 2016.

1. Meal prep. If you've never done this, just buy a few tupperware and the next time you cook dinner, cook two portions. Or even just two portions of one dish - so if you're doing chicken, rice, and broccoli, cook an extra portion of chicken breast and save it in the fridge. Now you've got a lot less work tomorrow night. You can eventually add other things in as you get more comfortable.

2. You get better at it. Cooking takes me half the time it used to. It's some combination of knife skills (which is huge), knowing how to cook stuff (you can cook stovetop scrambled eggs, on the highest heat settings, in like 90 seconds if you know what you're doing), knowing where everything is and how to get it, prep it, and get it to the burner ASAP. Time management is huge as well, if you're in the kitchen you could probably be doing something that either gets the meal on the table faster, or reduces cleanup time after. Which brings me to my next point...

3. CLEAN WHILE YOU COOK. Fucking crucial if you're going to do this more than one night in a row. 

4. Have some stuff that's ""good enough"". I don't mind a PB&amp;J for lunch, even though outside of the semester I'd never touch jelly, and bread very rarely.

5. Fruit's a nice little supplement. It's really easy to grab an apple and feel good about it. You can't do this for every meal, though, obviously. I just think people forget that fruit is so easy to eat, I never read anything about people eating fruit on this sub. Idk maybe it's ubiquitous so people never talk about it. 

I seem to do okay on this stuff. Another thing that really helped is getting up very early - like 5AM - to get breakfast, hit the gym, and get some studying in. Best of luck!"

2117	"The scam by the ink companies to make it literally more expensive than actual gold (the rare metal) is why I very rarely print. Doubly so because many of the printer companies intentionally design them to waste several times more ink than they need on startup cycles, ink disappearing into random unnecessary reservoirs and other tricks. 

Canon tries to include cheap printers in bundles knowing that $200 printer if they use actual canon ink is going to require thousands of dollars of ink over its lifetime. Not a good value at all. They've been also fighting to scam customers by adding mandatory DRM to keep someone from using ink from other companies to compete with their monopoly, but luckily I believe U.S. courts somewhat recently ruled that practice illegal. They will keep lobbying hoping to reverse it, of course.

"I work in commercial real estate finance and we're already seeing fundamental shifts due to increased rates.

It feels a lot like 2006. Nashville is completely swamped with vacant Class A apartments. I looked at a property there the other day where the whole block was giving away 2-3 free months of rent.

The Calculus for gst removal is more than the revenue impact though. Gst is poison and will always be associated with excessive spending. A lot of growth for a developing country is generated by direct investment, perhaps more popular faith in the government will stabilize the country and induce investment?

Group identity has always been paramount in society. All societies have operated this way, and it is not unique in any way to Marxism. Here in America—long before the teachings of Marx became prominent within our borders—society was heavily divided among ethnic and class lines. Down to as little as 1/8th of your ethnic ancestry. Similarly in places like India and the Middle East there were complicated ethnic-religious and class based caste systems. This is not at all a new development. Neither is the exploitation of these divisions, which has reared its head under literally every political and economic system.




The idea of Cultural Marxism seems nonsensical to me because of that simple fact. It’s more of a boogeyman than a real phenomenon. It takes something that already exists within society, slaps the word Marxism on it (because that’s a scary word), and is then used to disparage activist movements.



 This isn’t anything new by the way. To give an example, the US government attempted to used this exact tactic to derail the Civil Rights movement in the 1960’s. Stoke fears Communism.

2154	"As a very friendly and compassionate fat woman, I find that men tend to expect me to provide emotional and physical comfort to them. They will expect me to hug and cuddle them or sooth their feelings by listening to their issues. The thing is that I don't want to spend my energy taking care of men. I'm tired of it. It usually doesn't involve any mutual conversation or investment in me or the things I care about or want to discuss. 

I'd like men to take care of each other and themselves. I'd like them to get professional help instead of unloading on me and other women in their lives who happen to be kind-hearted. Life's hard on cisguys, sure, but it's tiring to be expected to listen and comfort and commiserate whenever someone has a feeling. "	"It doesn't scare me, but I am scared of marrying the wrong person, someone who just turns out to be all wrong for me. Like, no one wants to divorce if they can help it and, for women especially, there can be such judging if you get divorced, like you're so bad you couldn't even keep the guy willing to marry you and you failed at one of the easiest things to do in life. It's not easy, though. People get married because they think it'll be easy or they get married to ""fix"" an issue, when marriage is hard work and it will not fix anything. If you've got issues, it's best to avoid marriage until you can fix them... IF you can fix them. Marriage is such a commitment. And if kids come into the picture, too. And, while I don't care a lot about marriage, I know it's good for legal/tax reasons and, unfortunately or fortunately, you can never tell when someone will die or something happens and you need to be legally related to do something.

I'm worried about people/guys who also are afraid of marriage and divorce, in general. I feel like it's often commitment issues or because they believe all the stories men tell (who didn't really want to get married, but got married anyway) about how horrible marriage will be. Marriage is only horrible if you marry the wrong person/for the wrong reason, like you got pregnant or the family was pressuring you because you're getting older or you settled because you thought you could never get anyone else. And divorce fear is often because men think the women are going to take everything they've got, so they'll stay in a horrible marriage to avoid that. I NEVER want someone to stay married to me because they feel they have to. Don't cheat on me, ignore the marriage, be resentful because of the marriage, etc, because you feel you can't leave it."

Against your claim about them pumping it and saying deal with it, please provide evidence of insiders colluding with each other in order to push the price up.

So the burden of proof relies on you to show that the intentions of the talks they had were intended to solely pump up the price. Again I look forward to your evidence on that. And just in case you were wondering, circumstantial evidence does not incriminate lol

Why on Earth would you say they're trying to pump bch so hard? How many times have they covered it? Really what's your criteria of so hard.  I follow them and watch all crypto related clips that they post online, and for my view it's a handful of times. You can say that they give them a lot of air time but that doesn't make it true. 

I don't think you understand what the word evidence means. All you did is point out that they brought up bch multiple times and said it was a good investment. That's not evidence. I want evidence of collusion within fast money people with the hopes of pumping price. No other network is talking about crypto as much as they do.  I give them huge props because unlike say Bloomberg or Forbes, virtually all of their coverage on crypto is very positive.  they just happen to to also extent that positive Viewpoint to bch.

You have no idea what you're talking about. Of course you're going to go to add homonyms and say I'm chilling for bch. Check out my Twitter and my other post on Reddit. I'm on either side of the BTC vs. Bch debate.  the moment that anybody on the bch team does anything remotely close to this, I'll tear them to pieces.

Parents, friends, relatives, co-workers, all wanted to introduce me to this or that nice girl they were sure I'd just adore. A couple of times I went out with some friends (because they were annoyingly insistent) and the mandatory girl they invited, only for them finding out I was really nice to her with the intention of befriending her. Which I did in those occasions. I was very clear stating my intentions just after the first half an hour of conversation, something like: ""look, I'll be honest, I told your friends many times that I'm not interested in dating anyone, but they wouldn't listen, so, tired of this situation, I finally told them *yes* so we could get to this moment and they change their attitude from now on. I also think you are very nice, intelligent and funny, so we could try to be friends, if that's right with you"". Both times we were dining out, so we had plenty of conversation and it was nice except for my friends, who were kinda offended (those from the second ""incident"" were so angry that our friendship was never the same again after this).

This happened quite a few years ago, I'm married now, and those two girls (from both said occasions) are still very good friends of mine.

With my parents this whole issue was very, very difficult. They said many times that it was something I was doing to them, that I was unfairly punishing them for something they didn't even know what it was, and such preposterous stuff.

&gt;In expensive cities, rents fall for the rich — but rise for the poor

&gt;U.S. cities struggling with soaring housing costs have found some success in lowering rents this year, but that relief has not reached the renters most at risk of losing their housing.

&gt;Nationally, the pace of rent increases is beginning to slow down, with the average rent in at least six cities falling since last summer, according to Zillow data.

&gt;But the decline is being driven primarily by decreasing prices for high-end rentals. People in low-end housing, the apartments and other units that house working-class residents, are still paying more than ever.

&gt;Since last summer, rents have fallen for the highest earners while increasing for the poorest in San Francisco, Atlanta, Nashville, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Pittsburgh, Washington and Portland, Ore., among other cities. In several other metro areas — including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston and Miami — rents have risen for the poor and the rich alike.

&gt;The ongoing increase in prices for low-end renters poses a challenge for city officials who have vowed to lower housing costs for working-class residents already struggling with tepid wage growth in the U.S. economy.

&gt;City officials have said a boom in luxury housing construction would cause rents to fall for everyone else, arguing that creating new units for those at the top would ease competition for cheaper properties.

&gt;In part based on that theory, cities have approved thousands of new luxury units over the past several years, hoping to check high rents that have led more than 20 million American renters to be classified as “cost burdened,” defined as spending more than 30 percent of one’s income on housing.

&gt;But although some advocates say the dividends could still pay off for low-income renters, others say more direct government action is needed to prevent poor residents from being forced out of their cities or into homelessness. They have called for the federal government to help construct more affordable units, or offer greater rental assistance for poor families.

&gt;“For-profit developers have predominantly built for the luxury and higher end of the market, leaving a glut of overpriced apartments in some cities,” said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group. “Some decision-makers believed this would ‘filter down’ to the lowest income people, but it clearly will not meet their needs.”

&gt;Poorer city residents have experienced significant rent increases over the past several years. In Portland, average rents for the poor have risen from about $1,100 to $1,600 — or by more than 40 percent — since 2011.

&gt;In San Francisco, the average rent at the bottom of the market has soared from $1,700 to $2,600, a nearly 50 percent increase. Seattle’s poor have also had their rents rise by close to 40 percent. Nationwide, rents for those at the bottom have increased by 18 percent.

&gt;Rising rents for the poor threaten to add to the nation’s homeless population, and put an additional severe strain on tens of millions of families, often forcing them to forgo other basic needs to avoid losing their housing.

&gt;Construction in most U.S. cities came to a standstill during the Great Recession, amid a broader collapse in the housing market. As the economic recovery took off, its gains were disproportionately concentrated in a handful of cities, leading renters to move in droves to already densely populated urban areas.

&gt;There was not enough housing there to greet them. By the early 2010s, rents in major cities were beginning to increase by more than 10 percent annually. Several cities declared emergencies over their rising homeless populations.

&gt;In the following years, protracted battles have occurred in city halls nationwide over the size and makeup of urban communities, often pitting longtime homeowners trying to preserve the value of their properties against developers seeking to profit from the high demand.

&gt;Mayors have been caught in the middle, aiming to accommodate an influx of new residents who help boost the local economy without displacing those who have lived in their cities for decades. They have also faced intense pressure from influential developers and business groups that have pressed for the ability to develop new homes, as well as from landlords who enjoy high rents and fear seeing those values diluted.

&gt;The result has been a range of policy measures, including reforming zoning codes to encourage more development, creating new tools to finance affordable housing projects and rules mandating that developers include affordable units in their properties.

&gt;These measures have shown some signs of reducing rents, for both the rich and, to a lesser extent, the middle class.

&gt;For renters in the middle third of the income distribution, average rental prices have remained virtually unchanged since last summer, according to the Zillow data. Rents over the past year have also fallen slightly for the middle class of renters in Portland, Chicago, Philadelphia and Seattle.

&gt;The lack of affordable housing can be particularly pronounced in smaller cities such as Portland, which has struggled to accommodate about 40,000 new residents since 2010.

&gt;From 2010 to 2014, the city built only a few hundred affordable housing units, according to a city report. Since 2014, more than 95 percent of private construction in the city has been in “the luxury end of the market,” said Nick Fish, a city commissioner.

&gt;Private housing construction has exploded in Portland’s downtown area, along its south waterfront and in its historically black northeast community. But even as the city’s population has ballooned, its black population has decreased since 2014 by an average of 800 people every year, probably pushed out by gentrification, according to a study by Portland State University researchers.

&gt;In an email, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) pointed to 948 affordable rental units expected to open in 2018 and an additional 978 units scheduled for 2019. “We are actively creating housing options at every income level in every area of the city,” he said, adding that 10,000 more units are coming soon. “Our efforts are beginning to pay off: This will be the largest number of affordable units ever produced by the City of Portland in a single year in modern history.”

&gt;But for Rakhelya Levitskaya, a 66-year-old home-care aide who works with the elderly and disabled, little help appears to be on the way. A Ukrainian immigrant who has lived in the same Portland housing complex for 18 years, Levitskaya received notice of an approximately 10 percent rent increase this summer that she fears will push her into homelessness.

I just left a job at Spectrum with similar results because they wanted me to stay at $35k beneath the offer I had accepted before giving notice.  That team has shrunk from 14 to 5 in the last 12 months even with two new hires, and upper management's *solution* to the problem has been mandatory happy hours for the teams and massive stock buybacks instead of just paying people more money.

The next trilogy which was referred to by /u/UnholyDemigod I believe is Rian Johnsons, and is a completely new set of characters.

I think the direction Disney needs to go with SW is thus:

Imagine we have completely new trilogies A and B. Triolgy A's main character would have been given an origin movie before the first act. Then release act 2 in the 3rd year and act 3 in the 5 (keeping the same pacing), give triology B's main character or event an origin story in the 2nd and 4th year in between the trilogy before. 

We would have been introduced to the main character and why he/she is important, or to a major event, and why it is important, so when we enter the 3 acts of the trilogy, they can stand on their own and not be compromised by the issues that plagued suicide squad."	movies	movies	-1

Changes to ocean mixing and wind patterns are also expected. – Jennifer	"Because there's no ""half assing"" involved.

So by rearranging the expression you can solve something that looked unsolvable.

Also it doesn't really involve guessing the ""transoformation"" as he called it. You just need to identify how to split up the complex function into two simple functions, so you just need to understand what type of function you're looking for and find it within the provided one.

2245	"He bailed on the hike, but ""ghosted"" on the friendship. I'm using quotes because even though I know what phenomena I'm talking about, I'm suddenly very unsure if I've been using the right word to describe it this entire time. That said, in my experience, people generally don't appreciate it when people bail out or taper off friendships with no warning either. I've always been told that was inconsiderate and that the ideal response to not wanting to be around another person was being upfront and honest. 

It's unreasonable to actually expect ideal behavior from everyone all the time in practice, but we all have some idea what it's supposed to look like, so what's the harm in discussing whether or not that standard was met. That's what the gift of hindsight is for and for the most part, nobody hesitates to critique situations where women reject and/or disappoint men. It's happened in this thread a few times. 

People are willing to make excuses for the things this guy failed to do (ask about her relationship status, been upfront about his expectations instead of going silent, etc.) but not willing to do the same for OP who, at worst, didn't immediately see what was really going on. Once she did though, she acted in good faith, and I don't think she's been given enough credit for that. She could have bailed on him then but didn't. Instead, she chose to talk to him about it, and I think that was very mature. 

Actually, let's say that happened. OP realized that he thought this was a date, decided she didn't want to deal with potential drama, cancelled the hike, and then stopped talking to him without explanation. How does it compare to what actually happened? For instance, if what the guy did was a 3 on a 1-10 scale of general badness, what score would you give to someone who ended a relationship that way? 

If you think the score would be different, then I'd like to hear why since the only thing I can see that changed about the scenarios is who initiated the break in contact. Do you think she has an obligation to tell him that she ""figured it out"", or do you think bailing out or tapering off is really the ideal way to go about it?

From another side, if you have fuck-you money and spending it makes you happy, go ahead then.

2258	"You literally just made an argument that steam isn't a DRM system because .02% of their games don't employ DRM, which doesn't even include valve's own products.

Yet you're accusing me of omitting and skewing information - I'd like to know exactly what I've omitted or skewed in this discussion.  It's fine that they give that option to developers, but that really doesn't have anything to do with the point that I'm making. I said that steam is the biggest DRM system on the market, and it is. 

Systems like steam exist and have existed under different companies for many years. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, GOG, Ubisoft, EA, etc. You don't have to imagine what steam would have looked like under EA or Ubisoft, because they already exist and most other systems that I've used were just as good, if not better than steam, which takes up like 2 gigs of hard drive space and requires 50 mb updates seemingly every time i open it. 

Don't get me wrong, like I said I like steam and I use it. I just get annoyed that people bend over backwards to ward off any negative thoughts about it or valve, but then will at the same time froth at the mouth over another company. People personify these businesses like they're professional wrestlers and it's just really obnoxious how people have these unfounded biases and think one company is god's gift to gaming, while another, that could be doing something better (like GoG) is either ignored or bashed because it's against their naive hive minded train of thinking.

I do what I consider to be the balanced approach: I silently wait for the prayer to end before eating, usually with my head turned to look out a window. I do this out of respect for those present, but without deference to their practices or beliefs. I do not bow my head, hold hands, speak or listen; because, I am not a participant in the prayer. 

I've also tried excusing myself: ""I beg your pardon, however if you are going to pray, I will excuse myself and return when you're finished."" This is not received well - only because theists don't generally understand that forcing people to participate in religious practices can be offensive to an atheist's conscience.  

It will be perceived as rude and start a conflict if one ignores the prayer, continues speaking and begins eating. However, one could argue: ""From my perspective it is slightly rude to expect everyone to delay their meal while you conduct a ritual for a religion to which we don't belong, but we didn't object. It is extraordinarily offensive to expect that we will also participate in that ritual by bowing our heads, holding hands and listening to the recitation.""

But it sounds like you're internalizing a lot of guilt over things that aren't necessarily your fault. I don't understand why you think not being able to break the cycle of poverty is your fault - you're doing everything right as far as I can see: reducing expenses by having a roommate, holding down a professional job, etc. You're not a parasite - you're a human being trying really hard and working on figuring it all out. 

Homelessness is terrifying. I think you should attempt to avoid it at all costs. The main thing it sounds like you can do is talk to your roommate openly despite your fear. Hopefully she will be reasonable and sympathetic when you tell her you're so afraid of messing up that you're worried she'll kick you out. 

I would ask her how she think you guys can resolve your issues. Maybe defining some time for her to be alone in the apartment would help, or having her be really specific about what sets off her OCD so you can try to avoid it. Take notes! No one's memory is infallible, and she'll see that you're really trying. This is your best friend! You two can hopefully make it work. 

In regards to showering, my first reaction is, ""fuck them, shower in the bathrooms of the gender you identify with,"" but I understand that that might not be feasible depending on whether or not your gym is populated with ignorant assholes. One thing you can try is asking the manager at the gym where they think you should shower, or asking if there's a single shower anywhere. 

If you're extremely worried about expenses - maybe saving more will help you afford a new apartment if necessary? - look into relief options in your area. There's probably a soup kitchen nearby where you can get free food. See if you can qualify for food stamps or anything like that. There's probably also a shelter in your area, but I understand if you don't want to stay in one.

They are not evil, and the moment you content yourself to the idea you cannot see them in any way but an *enemy* you begin to tread the worn path that lead to the worlds greatest atrocities. The moment you start thinking it is impossible to get through to people, you should find yourself terrified at the implications. Because if it’s “us or them” then the only outcome that is guaranteed *is* tragic. 

At worst, assume your disagreements arise purely because others are uneducated, but don’t discount the idea that there is critical information that you are missing too. Nobody expects you to ever be persuaded that it’s ok that you and your loved ones are threatened, but is it possible for you to imagine that for some reason the people threatening you feel just as threatened *by* you? 

It’s hard. But the final thing I find helpful is to really focus on listening. When you feel that knee jerk or sigh because you’ve “heard it all before,” stop yourself. Try to take your own emotional response out of it. Assume you’ve misheard or misunderstood and listen. Instead of simply replying with your opinion or outright ignoring them, try to stand in their shoes, given just what you’ve heard, and ask an honest question relevant to your own view that you feel isn’t adequately answered. It’s got to be genuine, though, or it won’t work. This way you can work someone towards your own concerns in their mind. Sometimes they won’t be able to answer a question, and when you reach that point you know you’ve hit somewhere you can start changing someone’s mind.

The national media and the entire country gives a damn about Kavanaugh becaide he will ultimately be deciding the issues that WILL impact a woman and her right to choose.  He is then denying those allegations and doesn't think an investigation is necessary.

Ellison is calling for an investigation into Monahan' s claims.  Furthermore, the son who says he has the video has either misplaced it or can't find it and has not provided any other corrobating evidence at this time.  She says she shared the texts of a convo with others, and those people haven't come forward.

So to reiterate,  in one instance, we have mutilple people, including Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge telling us all about his drunken escapades and harassment but he doesn't want an investigation while he prepares to potentially be placed on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment, vs. Someone saying they had a video but no longer and an accussed calling for an investigation of himself into those claims.  He is furthermore mirrored by polling in Minnesota where ~60% want an investigation to determine the facts.

Kavanaugh doesn't want an investigation, Trump, McConnell, Grassley and others don't want an investigation.  Ellison does, Minnesotans do, and a vast majority of Americans want more info on Kavanaugh.

And guess what, if the allegations against Ellison are indeed true, he will probably be forced from office in a manner similar to what happened with Al Franken.

&gt;  cleared this up in the other part of what I wrote. Maybe you missed it. Christians are not arguing that God is a ""special case"" but rather that God performed the creative act of will

I'm not debating with ""Christians"", but with you the person.  I am often on either side of debates, based on what is being discussed, not the religion.  Nothing about whether he was a physical process or a will cover the idea that he could've been created.  Whether or not he is himself ""an atheist"" was the whole topic here.

&gt; which is fine, but not relevant to Christianity....

But we're not discussing Christianity.  We're discussing whether god is an atheist.  You specifically were commenting on how there must always be one with nothing behind.  I suggested that in the context we were discussing, many religions had the one with ""nothing behind"" die.  That seems to mess things up.

&gt; The OP argument here is, ""Assume God is real, does He not have a Creator?"" If I take it to mean, ""Assume Christianity is true, does God have a Creator?"" The answer is a clear no.

That's not what OP said at all.  He didn't even use the word ""Christianity"".  And he wasn't asking if God had a creator, but if god believed in a god above him (and if not if that made him an atheist).  You're the one who muddied it up even more by bringing up the mythology where the gods killed the beings that would be considered the creator god.

&gt; If you want to make a string of arguments that look like, ""what if god is wrong but thinks he is right?"" you can, but it is immaterial to any argument about Christianity at least.

That literally didn't happen.  Nobody is making that argument."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1
2356	"It's worse them not killing them on the spot, he judge their entire bloodline on the first man's sin. For eternity. The horror of facing death and losing a child, being raped, cancer eating away at your brain until you lose all sense of those you love and they say goodbye to a vegetable drooling under a florescent light. This is the cost for Eve doing what he knew she would do.

My issue there is the punishment, the world is temporary because of the price of our sin. Labor in the field and childbirth, death. Those were the outcome of a situation. The only outcome. Gods will, not ours. This world of pain and suffering was his creation and I find it insulting that the official texts blame Adam and eve. Instead of gods shitty parenting. Shitty only because he knew what eve would do. He knew it as soon as soon as he put the trees roots down. 

I say, if God did create us he owes us the truth. Maybe not eternal life, and never eternal suffering for doing what we had to survive his fallen world. His imperfect creations.

But it's far more likely genesis is another rehashing of common creation myths from the bronze age. And can't be aligned with modern ethics.

I'm assuming here since OP's post isn't the most fleshed out, but a common argument I've seen from theists for an all-loving God who doesn't come to help people in these sorts of situations is that God doesn't want to violate freewill through an intervention. My assumption is that this is what OP is getting at.

You lied by omission by intentionally withholding your past history with your friend when you were asked a direct question. I strongly agree with the belief that what’s in the past is in the past and it’s irrelevant to your present relationship. Personally, I wouldn’t have answered the question at all and have told my current SO that I don’t want to know about his previous sexual encounters and he doesn’t have a right to know about mine (we are both STI free and have no children so any exceptions that I would see as valid don’t apply).

But you did answer the question, and you answered with four truths and a convenient omission. 

And, quite frankly, I don’t feel particularly sorry for you. In your original post, you said:

&gt; Something similar happened previously where I didn't tell the truth about something that happened I a previous relationship and she asked me again and I told her the truth.

Why is it so hard for you to either a) tell your SO that you aren’t going to divulge your history, or b) to be completely honest when you do? I wouldn’t put up with a significant other who only told the truth when it’s convenient to him because that’s shitty. 

Yes, it was a kiss, and in the grand scheme of things — whatever. It’s not a big deal.

2392	No realistic amount of money spent can replicate educated, loving and involved parents.  Early childhood education begins and ends at home.  If you want to help the kids who are struggling, strengthen their families.	"The point is that people's preferences are not fixed and immutable.  If you ask them ""Are you actively looking for work right now?"" they will answer, truthfully, ""No"".  And that'll be corroborated by all the other supporting metrics - they're not collecting unemployment,  they're not looking for openings, they're not applying to jobs, they're not going to interviews.

And then maybe they go to a party and someone says ""The labor market is red-hot right now"" and they think to themselves ""Y'know, maybe I should just look around and apply to some jobs for kicks.""  Or their friend says ""My company is hiring, I can put your name in as a referral"" and they're like ""Well, I dunno, I like being home with the kids"" but they let him put it in anyway.  Or they hear about this cool technology called Ethereum, they don't really need to work, but these startup guys they met seem like they're really sharp and it'd be fun to see what's going on.

In all these cases, when they get back into the workforce their salary expectations are likely anchored by whatever they were making before, in cheaper times, and they'll be chosen over the job-hopper who heard they can get a 50% raise by looking around and apply to other jobs.  That's how they hold down wages."	Economics	Economics	-1

I was monogamous for 18 years, unhappy for a long time. At least I was honest saying I'm sleeping with other people (dead bedroom).

You are young, don't push a connection because you want something badly. Don't settle. If you all respect each other and he's not an equal, but put on a pedestal, then you are getting into polygamy. You don't want that either. Life is too short.

2409	"But James isn't talking about how we look in the eyes of other humans, he's talking about being ""**justified** by works, and not by faith alone"" (2:24). Justification happens before God, not before men. James also gives multiple examples: Abraham was ""justified by works"" and Rahab was ""justified by works"".

Certainly this doesn't mean that we can earn our own salvation (and the Catholic Church has consistently taught that we cannot earn salvation). But it does mean that works play a role in salvation along with faith. Faith and works are the hammer and anvil that God (by his grace) uses to shape us into righteous people. Faith and works are both subservient to grace, but both are involved in the process of salvation."	"Videos linked by /u/SaxonHuss:

He didn’t understand why it was inappropriate so I talked to him and he understood 1) don’t repeat it and 2) if he heard it again to tell his teacher. I don’t tolerate that kind of shit in my house and he’s going to learn that ASAP.

How he talks about the effects of pandering to your children instead of parenting them are particularly cogent.

Correct, taking this into account makes it much more likely that all of these Houses remained in power for so long.

Here's one example in actual history where things happened differently. King Philip III of France (House Capet)'s second surviving son, Charles, became Count of Valois and formed the House of Valois. His own son, the future Philip VI, would become King of France in 1328 due to the succession crisis that caused the Hundred Years Wars.

When Philip VI took the throne, the House of Valois became the royal house, but Philip VI was simply Philip III's grandson through his son Charles. Had that happened in ASOIAF, the royal House would have remained House Capet.

Because that was their stated goal. They want to raise the student's self esteem.

The problem is the Milton Friedman philosophy.  Before that, most companies tried to contribute to the general welfare; and they paid their workers a fair and living wage and provided medical insurance (for the entire family!) and even a pension!

And now many of the products produced are crap (i.e., low quality) because everything used has to be cheaper, because shareholders!

Why is a shareholder of more value to a company than the customer?"	"100% true, the Zionists interfere in EVERY US election, we have DUEL CITIZENS in our government itself, serving israeli interests, the president MEETS with the jewish league after every election to get his agendas!

For example, if you had a utility closet or a shed or garage, it probably wouldn't be an issue.

 We survived being preverbal, and we lived through nonstandard language, and even today people are born in communities where ""correct"" means utilizing a smattering of constructions from various languages. It is unfortunate that the relatively recent notion of prescriptive language has facilitated this sort of idol worship.

Our last split was with Frisian if you want to see what ""real"" English is more like (as long as you insist on tradition over innovation as a metric for quality).

2441	"&gt;The dots themselves are obviously physical (as little bits of your screen lit up brighter than nearby spots), but the more abstract concept of a 'line'? That only exists because of the physical relationship between the 8 dots. Still, though, that relationship is physical.

This is where it all falls apart. You're telling me the dots exist, because they are the ink on the page, but you're not telling me what a line IS. Math doesn't exist in your world. Pure and simple. Now, toes can be counted, and scores can be added, but math isn't a physical thing. Period. End of story. Math is a concept that you apply to real things. 

Your idea caves in on itself. No one really believes that. No one truly believes only the physical exists. You said it yourself, math is a concept. What you have to accept is that a concept exists, because the definition of exists is:
have objective reality or being.

Objective:
not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts.

Real:
actually existing as a thing or occurring in fact; not imagined or supposed.

Being:
existence.

Math is an occurring fact not influenced by your personal feelings. 2+2 is always 4. Math exists, it is not physical. *shrugs* It's a simple concept. It ruins your idea of reality because your idea of reality is based on a presupposition you have, not the definition of the word reality.

EDIT:
To drive the point home:

Concept: an abstract idea; a general notion.

Abstract: **existing in thought** *or* as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.

You can see based on the definition of abstract that there are things with physical or concrete existence. Physical or concrete is a type of thing that exists. A physical existence, or a concrete existence. You can also have a non-physical existence as I described above. 

Existing in thought. Thoughts are not physical. It's like a rant, but it's just laughably false that everything is physical.

Look at banks. Banks are incredibly regulated. My father was a CFO of a mid-sized bank. One of their claims to *success* was lower NFS fees. This attracted obviously lots of poorer customers who willingly overdrew their accounts and racked up charges. The government sees this and says that's exploitation. His bank did a study of the customers who overdrew to understand why they were doing this. They found out it wasn't from a lack of understanding how NFS charges work but that it was ***cheaper*** than the alternative like a late phone bill or power bill! This same finding occurred when evaluating pay day loans. [Source](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/payday-loans/). When big brother stepped in to try to regulate they actually hurt consumers by removing their only options to credit. 

Your point regarding lobbyist isn't without merit. Companies use government to create regulations that hinder their competition. This is what the cable/telecomes companies have done.

Considering they employ so few, and have no major infrastructure behind them except for Amazon (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, etc are all just software companies that have some manufacturing... in Asia) they aren't stuck in any one city, state, or even country, and their insane size makes them individually economically larger than most eastern European nations.

Every nation on the planet prostates itself at the feet of those 5 (and often Samsung, Sony, etc) to try to get some of their workers living in their countries because they are awash in so much money. It doesn't even matter if their presence doesn't positively impact your ability to keep functional infrastructure or security in your nation because they pay negative taxes, their presence acts as a gravity well to pull in all kinds of tech investment.

“My bill went up.”
“Let me see here AH YES you were given a promotional blah blah blah and it expired.”
“Okay. Give me the new one.”
“Let me see what’s available...”

Fast forward like 90 seconds and LO AND BE FUCKIN HOLD the same deal was available at a slightly higher rate. I said, “I just don’t feel like I am getting that much value. Why should I pay you $100 when I have Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and a cell phone and none of those cost nearly what you do?”  He discounted it another $20.

2453	"On mobile, so no fancy embedded quotes this time. 

You keep insisting on a discussion, and that was never my intention. Imagine you, me, and a group of people are standing around. Now picture 200 children and women say ""that guy over there molested us for years,"" and that guy then says ""yeah, I did, sorry about that."" Now, that is more than enough for most rational human beings. We would advocate justice for his victims, and certainly wouldn't want our own kids around him. Once he is tried in court, we respect the ruling and applaud the legal system for rightfully protecting minority victims from a predator.

But there's one guy in the group (you in this case) who goes ""hold on everybody, we need to discuss how this guy is probably not really guilty, and is himself a victim of a liberal witch hunt by people frustrated with Trump. And while we're on the subject, let's talk about how touching kids wouldn't be so bad if we just didn't make such a big deal about it."" 

At this point, I look to the other people in the group and say, ""This guy either has such bad judgement that he can't recognize a self admitted predator, or he does recognize the situation and just dose not care - in which case, he has poor values. Regardless, he either has poor judgement or poor values, and we don't really need to waste time talking to him.""

You don't like that, say I'm calling you names, and then call the entire group prudes. 

Over the course of this conversation you have gone from ""we have no evidence he did any real sexual abuse"" to ""ok, fine there is some evidence, mabey he molested kids, mabey he didn't, but what's an unconcented, ungloved, pelvic exam on a minor - is that so bad.""  

Now I admit, I have not been nice to you, and that is not something I enjoy. But, you are easy to read. From the beginning, I said you had a strong bias, poor judgement, and poor values. You are certainly not someone I would ever want around my or anyone else's children. Even if you are not a predator yourself, I don't believe you have the common sense to recognize one. Everything you have said has proven the initial evaluation correct.

So no, I'm not going to discuss any subsequent issues further. Not with you, and not on the back of a clear cut case of child molestation.

Mirrors edge is similar, the original was released to solid sales and critical acclaim. Then the sequel went open-world (because of course it did, every game was at this point) and it turns out that the the game suffered for it.

Now the Mirrors Edge situation is partially to blame on the gamers.

2493	"&gt; Her strategy made perfect sense.

She campaigned hard against the progressive platform pushed by Bernie Sanders until she snuffed out most of the energy on the left. The remaining elements were bitter that she pushed bank interests over people and didn't support her bid to be President for giant banks. She alienated a lot of people in the campaign against Sanders. 

The only way her strategy made sense is working on behalf of the Trump campaign to elect Donald Trump.

After she fought for giant investment banks, she went on to talk about immigration, abortion, open borders, closing coal businesses, and on and on. It was a truck load of red meat ready for the wolves. Her name by itself energizes their base. If you add [immigration, expanding diversity visas, and open borders](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/8/hillary-clinton-dreams-open-borders-leaked-speech-/), the rest is just icing on the cake.

2502	"&gt; They may not have WANTED to fight, but they sure were fighting for slavery. Straight up, unambiguous fighting to protect the institution of slavery.

They seceded for a myriad of reasons, and, yes, slavery was the *single* biggest issue. However, saying the Confederacy/Civil War was *about* slavery is like saying the American Revolution was about taxes.

The root issue was that there were major political divides between the North and South (and not just on slavery).  The North used it's massive population (comparatively) to wield political power in the Federal government passing laws very unpopular in the South (again, the slavery issue is a blatant example).

[Look at the 1860 Presidential election for a visible representation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860#/media/File:PresidentialCounty1860Colorbrewer.gif)  Lincoln was elected despite the fact that he didn't carry a single Southern district.  Imagine if this was the 2016 election map.

However, the Civil War itself was to preserve the Union/preserve independence from the Union - not to end or preserve slavery.  Lincoln himself said that if he could have preserved the Union by allowing slavery to continue, he would have. Additionally, Congress had introduced bills to allow the South to keep their slaves and yet the South **still** chose to leave - simply because they no longer trusted the North to act in good faith for both parties. The [Crittenden Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise) and the [Corwin Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_Amendment) and the [Dred Scott case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) just years earlier are prime examples of this.

Even more to the point, the average Southern soldier didn't own slaves and the average Northerner who fought for the Union would be considered severely racist by today's standard's as well.  Had they believed that they were dying en-mass only to end/preserve slavery, nobody would have fought.

Even more, several slave holding States (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee) stayed in the Union - [up until Lincoln declared de-facto war on the then Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lincoln%27s_75,000_volunteers).  They switched because they believed that the Union under Lincoln was the aggressor - as is stated by officials in each state.

(B) There was a violent storm going on (John 6.18). It's not a plausible explanation for this situation.

Secondly, not everything is subject to evidence. I saw a rainbow two weeks ago. I have no evidence of it, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Rainbows don't leave evidence. For the Jesus story, we have three accounts of its occurrence. It's not like they could take a picture. The only people who could testify to its truth are the 12 disciples who saw it. There's no other possibility for evidence, not even corroborating records. Only 12 people saw it. A few years back some friends and I saw a mountain lion cross the road in Vermont. Scientists say there are no mountain lions in Vermont. He was there and gone before we could take a picture. None of us have any evidence; there are no corroborating records. But we know what we saw. We all saw it. You say there is ""absolutely no evidence"" of the walking on water, but we do have evidence. We have the records from those who were eyewitnesses. Though you may doubt Matthew (as many people do, but I don't), John's Gospel is much more an account from an eyewitness. That's the evidence we have. To rebut the accounts you have to prove that Matthew and John are incompetent to be telling us history."

2523	"How I do it : 

1 main multiplayer game (used to be CS then stuff like Planetside, CSGO, H1Z1) now it's PUBG and rocket league from time to time.

I like to become good at one game at a time when it comes to a more multiplayer/competitive game and stick with it untill I get bored and move on to the next thing.

Then I make a list. I'll get 1 single player game that I CANNOT discard for anything else untill it's completed (unless the game is trash but I usually pick something I know I'll enjoy). 

This is hard to do sometimes but I always tell myself that If I want to play the next thing on my list I just need to power through it, sometimes that means to forget about side-quests etc, but I don't like to leave a game without seeing the ending. (I leave exceptions for games I decided to replay). 

So my main SP game right now is FarCry5 but I'm replaying Bloodborne at the same time, it works for me too since one is on PC and the other one is on console. 

Anyway... this works for me... but I almost need to make a list and stick with it, review the list every 2-3 months maybe to add or change stuff (for which games take priority next) It's also a great way to wait for sales since... if you know X games is 3-4 games away on the list there's just no reason to buy it now. 

"	"[Mirror's Edge Catalyst at hyper settings on GTX 970 vs R9 390](https://youtu.be/Bm5ZCJah-FY?t=48s) - you can see how the 970 runs out of VRAM and performance collapses. 

AC Unity ran like crap at launch but it runs OK now. With a 4 core i5 and GTX 970, it runs at 1080p 60FPS high settings without a problem, and I'm pretty sure that at ultra settings it uses 3-4GB VRAM. I personally played through the game on a i5-6500 and GTX 1070 at ultra settings.

I played through AC Syndicate when I had a HD 7970 3GB and I ran out of VRAM with some of the more demanding settings - it needed like 3300MB or something, which would also explain why you ran it fine on a 970.

You ran Rise of the Tomb Raider on a 970 with 3.5GB VRAM which has barely enough VRAM for very high texture quality. Take a look at the timestamp in this video - [GTX 1060 3GB runs out of VRAM in the in-game benchmark and has a lot of stuttering](https://youtu.be/y1RWItff0eQ?t=5m32s). I played RotTR on my 7970 3GB and had to run the game at high texture quality instead of very high.

I myself had no problems with running Ghost Recon Wildlands with a 1070, but the game VRAM usage meter was at around 3.3-3.5 GB so I took it for its word. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I can't find any reliable VRAM usage numbers for Deus Ex Mankind Divided; the only one I found was [this one](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/deus-ex-mankind-divided-pc-graphics-performance-benchmark-review,11.html) but it's using a Titan X so the game would've used as much VRAM as possible. I'll retract this game.

DOOM does run wonderfully but there's a nightmare setting that requires 5GB VRAM to enable, which is what I was referring to.

Also I'm not really moving goalposts at all; I originally said that

&gt; All of these games are obviously playable with GPUs that have 3GB VRAM, but they'll have stuttering if you max out settings like texture quality while playing at 1080p.

My entire point is that there's a lot of graphical features in modern games that'll drive VRAM usage through the roof, and I gave a couple of examples."	Games	Games	-1

You're a supplicant doormat afraid of confrontation. She see's this for the weakness that it is and has no respect for you. If you act like a doormat, why wouldn't she walk all over you?

Because you are still scared of your girlfriend you have abandoned all hope of solving the issue yourself. Instead you hope she fixes the problem while you continue to end over backwards for her. 

You have also made a covert contract along the lines of ""If i remain a nice guy to her...she has to respect me"" which is a completely wrong way of addressing the issue.

Yes. That is exactly what a self respecting human being would do.

&gt; but at the same time I really love her and I feel if I stay calm, compromise and be the bigger person, she might realise and come around.

You don't really love her. You are insecure man in a toxic relationship to scared of his girlfriend to initiate a break up and probably scared of being alone. 

You have also doubled down on the nice guy covert contract. No matter how much you suck up to her you will not guarantee the success of this relationship rather, especially by the looks of it now, the impending failure.

Everyone may need a rock to keep them steady once in a while but nobody wants a complete tool they can shit on. She treats you this way because this is the precedent you have set for yourself with your behavior. Take note though I'm not trying to blame you for this, mostly because i don't think moralizing this issue does any meaningful help. **If you put someone on a pedestal, they have no choice but to look down on you.** I personally don't see ant point in continue to try to salvage this relationship, it is clear she is disgusted by you.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), formerly known as electroshock therapy, and often referred to as shock treatment, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from mental disorders. The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 and is the only currently used form of shock therapy in psychiatry. ECT is often used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, and catatonia. ECT machines have been placed in the Class II category (special controls) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1976.

A Christian wants you to believe in Christianity. I, as an atheist, doubt their god claim. For them to get me from where I am now to becoming a Christian, they must create a logical path. They must first successfully convince me a god exists before they can make any further arguments that their god exists and is the only god.
