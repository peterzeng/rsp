"Sounds on your wife just plans on trickle truthing you - as you discover info she will break down and admit to that piece.  She has no intention of coming completely clean.  It shows no respect for your marriage.  

Just some advice,  try not to give her a heads up about going to see a lawyer.  I don't know about your financial situation but you are in an emotional place and although money/finances might not seem important now, down the road you will kick yourself for not getting the best deal, particularly in terms of your pension or long term assets.   You should definitely grab screen shots of texts and info about her affair partner, although  many states are no fault, they may consider fault when looking into division of assets.

Good luck"	relationships	relationships	-1
2	"No offense but I think the “build more housing” argument is extremely lazy and uninformed. I can’t speak for LA, but having lived in the SF Bay Area my whole life and having seen the almost apocalyptic and ceaseless development since the tech boom of the ‘90’s, I call tell you for damn sure that “build more housing” has been the guiding mantra for developers for the last 30 years. Nearly every flat piece of land in Tracy, Livermore, Dublin, and much of the South Bay is covered in high density tract homes. The immediate Bay Area (all areas adjacent to the Bay) is hemmed in by hills and parkland, so the only way to expand is up, and that’s expensive. 

My experience is that the housing here is expensive because people are willing, and mostly able, to pay a premium. Few developments are “affordable” because they don’t need to be. Folks, especially high wage, young knowledge workers, buy up $850k two bedroom condos in new developments like it’s a great deal. The demographic that developers are targeting are rich and legion, and I can’t blame them; strike while it’s hot!

But any idea that “the free market will solve our problems” is a fallacy to some extent. The free market wants profit (rightfully so) and the housing market in this area is supported by the very wealthy and very motivated so there’s very little incentive to try to appeal to a lower-earning demographic. 


Also: I work with the local utility and the amount of new developer applications (large volume developments, multi unit apartments/condos, and large single family communities) is so overwhelming multiple contractors have been hired to supplant the normal staff.

We’re building more housing. It’s expensive. There’s a massive skills and earning gap between residents . Rent control and more housing won’t solve that."

3	"While we are not directly possessed or controlled by God, everything that we do would still be a result of his intention. If I raise my right hand as I'm typing this, God intended for that to happen. When he created the universe, he knew from the beginning, ""On the 28th day of the 10th month of the year 2018 A.D. of the planet Earth, at 11:13 EST, a young man sitting in his dorm room using his obnoxiously large and blue laptop will raise his right hand just to make a point"". If he did not plan/""intend"" for me to raise my right hand, I wouldn't have done it. He did not control me to take that action, but it was still all part of the plan. Everything would be part of the plan, because he planned everything. I am in control of myself, but my actions were still intended to happen and planned for. Do you know why he could do that? Because he's omniscient and omnipotent. It has everything to do with being all-powerful and all-knowing. If my actions weren't intended, then he is not all-powerful/knowing. If he is not all-powerful/knowing, then he could not have intended my or anyone else's actions, and would not be worth talking about.

And so as to not stray off-topic, I'll re-iterate my first and primary question: What reasons do you have to believe that your first comment is true? The comment that I asked you to put into your own words."	I'm not making an ontological claim about the existence of objective moral reasons. I'm merely reporting obvious conceptual entailments. If it turns out there is no objective moral facts then moral reasons entail normative demands that aren't really there and error theory is true. The ontological reality makes no difference to the facts about what the concept of a moral reason is about or entails.	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

If he’s a shitty 5 year old, at this point it’s irrelevant.  I’m no member of the tinfoil hat club, but it’s pretty clear that these political appointees, no matter their “party” are appointed for a reason...  1/2 sycophancy and 1/2 ambition.  Much like a 5 year old playing “Watch me, daddy!”.	Don't think the young turks instigated while selling fake pills albeit they are just as opinionated and not really worth the time.

 **Answer to your question starts here:** Hubble specializes in taking visible light observations, or pictures if you will, although it has tools to measure in other wavelengths, whereas  JWST is going to specialize in longer wavelengths like infrared due to the expansion of the universe redshifting wavelengths from so far away. This will allow us to see what the universe might've been like when it was just a wee baby and starting to create galaxies"	"Feeding them antibiotics is mainly bc it makes animals grow bigger.


Certain antibotics, when given in low, sub-therapeutic doses, are known to improve feed conversion efficiency (more output, such as muscle or milk, for a given amount of feed) and may promote greater growth, most likely by affecting gut flora.

https://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/growth-promotants-and-production-enhancers/antimicrobial-feed-additives

According to the National Office of Animal Health (NOAH, 2001), antibiotic growth promoters are used to ""help growing animals digest their food more efficiently, get maximum benefit from it and allow them to develop into strong and healthy individuals"". Although the mechanism underpinning their action is unclear, it is believed that the antibiotics suppress sensitive populations of bacteria in the intestines. It has been estimated that as much as 6 per cent of the net energy in the pig diet could be lost due to microbial fermentation in the intestine (Jensen, 1998). If the microbial population could be better controlled, it is possible that the lost energy could be diverted to growth.

 "	Personally in my opinion the best way to increase the number of pull ups you can do in a row is to perform other lat targeted work and variations of the same excersize at different weight and intensity. Always do overhanded pullups instead of underhanded chinups because the majority of people neglect their lats and a chinup is very back-bicep based so a pull up is better. 	Fitness	Fitness	-1

Perhaps the split wasn't as unreasonable as the many Reddit experts in this thread seem to think.	Clojure is a counter-example to this. It emphasizes pure functional programming, but because of it's tight integration with the host language (Java), it has tons of easy escape hatches if you need mutability. Indeed, if you *reallllly* need mutability / performance, it's trivial just to write some Java and call it from Clojure. I think this presents a really good alternative to adding functional features to imperative languages.	programming	programming	-1

21	I clicked on this because I was suspicious too. But if you actually read the posts, it’s clear that these are wildly different situations. This OP actually does have a weight problem, and she’s working to loose weight. (Seriously, six pounds in two weeks is great work, OP. You should be proud of your commitment and your progress, rather than being ashamed that you got there after two pregnancies and raising two babies.) Plus, her husband apparently addressed this very kindly and gently and hasn’t been shaming her and has been trying to build her up now that he knows how he made her feel. The other OP’s wife was, by his own admission, nowhere near overweight, in fairly healthy shape, and worked out regularly too. Plus, he was picking fights with her every 4-6 months because she wouldn’t adopt a strict enough diet to get “skinny.” These are two wildly different situations. 	He’s gaslighting you.

&amp;nbsp;

However, it's important to remember that geographical variations alter the amount of UV that one is exposed to when outdoors. For example, [in this pretty cool study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363523), they compared endogenous Vitamin D synthesis in sunny Miami, FL versus chilly Boston, MA. They found that year-round in Miami, all that someone with type III skin (meaning they sometimes burn in the sun, but usually uniformly tan) needed to synthesize 400 IU of Vitamin D was 3-6 minutes in the sun at noon. Three minutes! We spend less time than that exposed to sun while driving in cars, walking around, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

It's clear that despite this exposure, people are still deficient in Vitamin D. The simple and safest solution to the above is to protect yourself from the sun and supplement Vitamin D in the diet. That way, our skin is protected from UV radiation and Vitamin D is safely provided."	askscience	askscience	-1

I don't really understand the people who don't want to see if he can develop as a qb first but I guess they're mostly making note of obvious similarities between him and other guys who have already either flamed out or transitioned to receiver . 

Personally I see him as the same kind of prospect as Josh Allen, high ceiling and super low floor,but with a backup plan if it doesn't work out.

If he rolls the STR to CHD (giving up 1k STR) and then letting him re-roll CDR on one of his rings to (assuming he has socket/CHD/CHC as he should) the best would be flat damage or 500 str.

The answer is going to depend on what else he has. Eventually that primal has to go (in favor of socket / crit / crit / ele). But rolling the str away could be good if he has sub ideal rings (meaning he is currently sacrificing crit for CDR) or like a really good SoJ or something.

There's absolutely no way the OASIS runs on one server, and in fact it would need so many data centers because it's apparently like several times the size of Google.

"&gt; Your first point doesn't disprove Eren being the father


Of course it doesn't disprove anything with 100% certainty, but I think my point still stands. What I was trying to get across was that Eren being the father doesn't make sense (again, to me) because:


- he was against the idea of ""breeding like cattle"" right from the get go;


- even IF things have changed and even IF Eren was the one who actually went back on his word and came to Historia telling her to get pregnant, he still doesn't need to be the father in that scenario, nor would it make any sense for him to be, for the many reasons I pointed out, but the main ones being that any man would be suitable for the job and that by Eren actually providing the ""seed"", he could be dooming his future generations to come to said cattle life, something he wouldn't do *especially* while knowing that they have literally nothing else to think of.


&gt; your smiles and general tone of writing as I interpret it come across as condescending and overall dismissive of opposing views.


Two of his 3 points started out like this:


- Your first point is entirely pointless


- Did you even read the chapter properly?


You can argue that there was nothing wrong with the first one, but the second one is simply a childish, useless comment that serves no purpose whatsoever. To me, it's as if the user was clearly baiting and/or being a dick for no reason.


My smiles were not to be seen as you described, instead it was just me going ""well, you're seemingly upset, being obnoxious and insulting for no reason, but I won't stoop to your level, I'm fine with what you have to say but won't engage with similar behavior :)"" and that's it, trying to keep a positive vibe, is all, but I see your point that it could be perceived differently, it's just that said user decided to start things off in a rather asshole-ish manner while literally everywhere and everyone else in the thread is acting like a normal human being.


So yeah, I wasn't dismissing anything. As for his 3rd point, he just summarized a portion of the chapter *as if* I hadn't grasped it somehow, which I fail to see where/how I gave that impression.


He said:


&gt;Some MP fodder mentioned suspicious timing of Historia’s pregnancy.


Yes, he did. How does any of that imply that Eren is the father?

&gt; They can’t feed Siege to her if she’s still pregnant because it would kill the baby.

Yes, he did. How does any of that imply that Eren is the father? x2



&gt; The pregnancy was someone’s plan (Eren’s) to prevent her from inheriting Beast titan for quite a while and give Eren some time to create or execute the plan that would save her, as I said earlier.


And for the 3rd time, it being Eren's plan and Eren being the one to have come to Historia has 0 correlation to this meaning that he has to be the father, which is why I probably appeared to be dismissive of this point of his when he pretty much treated me as if I hadn't actually read the chapter."

I'm not sure how you define rural but there are numerous level 2 trauma centers in places with 50k population, which doesn't happen in the UK.  By way of example, there are 4 in South Dakota and 3 in Montana, two states with less than a million residents.  It's difficult (and expensive) to recruit specialists to live in these places, but we do it.  We should celebrate our achievements and successes in this area.

&gt;Having a rural hospital doing neurosurgery is a recipe for disaster, regardless of location. Surgeons need volume to keep up their skills.

There's enough volume in these places to keep skills up, especially since the lack of colleagues means you'll handle relatively higher case volume.

My main concern with medicare-for-all is that we accelerate the adoption of a two-tiered public/private system where the bottom tier is much worse off.  We have medicare/caid-for-most (slim majority) currently, and they (more or less) have access to the same services as everybody else.  If you shift 50/50 to 80/20 then the 80% will be worse off.  And to service that 20% you have physicians (and now even specialists) fleeing into concierge practices which reduces their patient panels and reduces demand even further.

Inflation rate, cost of debt, unemployment rate, and even population growth are all factors that differ from region to region and influence the strategies used to deal with financial instruments that out-run the economies they're intended to serve.

In any case I'm agreeing with you, a single metric is a terrible way to analyze any economy. As an American I'm concerned our low unemployment rate is a rather unfortunate consequence of stimulus without the necessary regulation needed to maximize it's utility.

"Growing up a Protestant in a Free Methodist church, we learned that Moses was commanded by God to strike the rock and water will flow from it.

Moses sent his spies and when they reported of said giants, Moses decided not to enter the Promised Land and God essentially levied the same punishment as he had when Moses had struck the rock twice.

"&gt;these problems are trivial and don't need to be solved by humans. 

Welcome to the world of fourth generation and fifth generation programming languages.  ""All this stuff is easy, we can automate it away in a flash, here's a language that does as you describe instead of doing what you tell it to do"".

Every last one of them crashed and burned.

CRUD is damned easy.  Show a table, add a few buttons, no trouble.

CRUD in a business is not CRUD, it's business rules.  Yeah, you let me update an employee, but before you do that you need to know:

What other tables to change.

What updates are okay to made.

Who can make what updates.

How updates that the user tries to enter translates to data stored in a database.

What other actions might need taken in the background on user update, like recording the change, sending out messages, or otherwise.

and so on and so forth.

The trouble is that knowing *all* of these business rules, and making an app that not only does CRUD, but is open to also dealing with these business rules becomes very hard very fast to automate away with a wave of a magic wand.

CRUD is easy, but CRUD applications are often very very difficult.

The best solution, wouldn't you guess, that we have today, is to have a low-end programmer with the tools they need to do the updates quickly and easily, and to ensure this low-end programmer knows the business rules.  The person is cheap, they aren't a high end programmer, and they can get work done easy.

Which is exactly what businesses have settled on.

&gt;Unfortunately, you are the same kind of idiot, who can only hand-code REST API, and you know zilch about hard problems.

Who I am doesn't matter for this conversation, and you are making leaps and guesses here you should not be making of other people.  It is hostile, rude, and unacceptable to speak to others like this.

&gt;One of the biggest problems of today's software is unnecessary complexity.

I suppose it should be as easy, at the end of the day, to have code that looks like this: 

LOAD OPERATING SYSTEM

LOAD DRIVERS

LOAD USER INTERFACE

SHOW USER CLICKED PROGRAM

Very simple.  The rest can be automated.

Sounds easy, but if it is so easy, there is a billion dollar industry ripe for disruption, and you can change the world.  The trouble is that problems that have sat unsolved for years, despite many large scale attempts (look into fourth and fifth generation languages), are generally unsolved for very good reason.  

The only reasonable solution to writing ""simple"" code that has no complexities I can see is to have an AI sitting in the background that figures it all out for you.  Trouble is, AI aren't quite that smart yet."	programming	programming	-1

183	"Maybe what they should have said is a defined class system. 

While you're technically correct that ""anyone can make it"" in America, I believe the potential for people to do so has declined in recent years. The economy is saturated with massive corporations that engage heavily in anti-competition practices. While there are quite a few who may be able to make it to low-level millionaire status, the vast majority of the mega-wealthy (billionaires) either inherited their wealth or inherited the means to acquire it. "	"Let's start by making clear what Prop. 10 would do. Currently, California has a state law called the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act that prohibits cities and counties from doing three major things with respect to rent control. Local governments are not allowed to:

* Implement rent control on single-family homes.
* Take away the right of landlords to charge what they want for apartments after a rent-controlled tenant moves out.
* Control rents on buildings constructed after 1995. The law also locked into place rules in cities with rent control when Costa-Hawkins passed like 1978 in Los Angeles. 

Prop. 10 simply repeals that law, allowing cities and counties to do what they want on rent control.

So to your point, yes it's possible that cities and counties — and organizations trying to add rent control via initiative — would try to extend rent control to single-family homes and/or to new apartment construction. However, proponents of the measure say there's no modern rent control regime that includes new construction and little interest in extending rent control to single-family homes owned by individuals rather than institutional investors.

In short, yes if Prop. 10 passes, cities and counties could do what you're saying. But supporters say it's unlikely to happen. -Liam"	IAmA	IAmA	-1

189	I found out my then fiance cheated on me with my ex best friend. My ex best friend's husband was also my best friend.  When he found out, he tried to kill himself. Those 2 days still make my heart ache. 	"This is why I am *so angry* with anyone who falsely accuses another of sexual assault. These people need to be socially condemned to the highest degree. Humans are fallible, and react with emotion more than reason. I try to encourage anyone who is trying to impress the gravity of the impact that sexual assault has on someone's life to also champion the condemnation of false accusers. 

Rapists wouldn't get away with anything if we could stop dividing ourselves between people who care about victims and people who condemn false accusations. We are on the same side.

My heart breaks for every person that is assaulted, and I want justice for them.

Unfortunately, bringing up fake accusations usually places me in the 'other' group (in this case the group of deniers) even though that categorization couldn't be further from the truth. It is easier to dismiss someone's opinion if you feel they are not on your side.

I just wanted you to know I am vehemently on your side. I recognize the scope and severity of the issue, since I've been talking about this with my friends long before this burst into the news.

I think there is a false line that needs to be broken down. Almost everyone (aside from sadists and the perpetrators themselves) is on the side of condemning perpetrators and supporting victims. 

The false line is caused by fear. Men know that their own lives can be ruined at the drop of a hat from a single accusation, whether misconstrued, or outright false. 

As quoted in your post, ""And the deniers aren't willing to hear that. They're more afraid that what they do MIGHT be perceived as rape. Or attempted rape. And they fear for their own freedoms, rather than care about the loss of freedoms in the victims.""

This is my exact point. Their very real fears are dismissed out of hand. To imply that someone's fear for their freedoms (freedom meaning not being in jail, not being completely ostracised by everyone around you, to not be able to feed and shelter yourself and your family because your whole career and livelihood is destroyed) is trivial, honestly shows a lack of empathy. This is not a trivial fear. This fear is a fear of survival. Our survival instinct is one of our oldest instincts, dating back to the Cambrian era, several hundred million years ago.

They don't fear for their own freedoms *rather than* care about the loss of freedoms of the victims. These are *not* mutually exclusive, and to treat them as such separates you from a vast group of people ready and willing to help you.

My guess is that this denial would dissipate if you really recognized this deep-seated fear in them, rather than dismissing it without consideration."	AskWomen	AskWomen	-1

*Vague dates like ""coming soon"" or ""shipping soon"" to lure pre-orders is outlawed in Germany, after a Munich Regional High Court ruling, in which a litigant took reseller MediaMarkt to court over excessive delivery delays. For any retailer to sell a pre-order for a commodity or a digital software license (i.e. take payment before product launch date),* ***the reseller must specify the exact date of on which the product will be delivered.*** *In other words, the onus is on the reseller to specify when a buyer will have the product or digital license in their possession, before making the sale, and ensure that the product reaches the consumer on or before the specified date.*

***Resellers that are unable to specify a delivery date would be breaking the law by soliciting pre-orders.*** *The new ruling bolsters Germany's consumer rights laws, which are among the strictest in the world. German consumers are already within their rights to return a product they don't like for no reason, within a finite amount of time after the sale. If a retailer delivers later than the specified delivery date, the consumer can refuse the product and become eligible for a full refund. Perhaps the biggest impact of this ruling will fall on the real-estate industry. Real-estate developers taking payments from home-buyers before the completion of the development (i.e. transfer of possession) of a property, must be ready to cough up a full-refund (adjusted by inflation), if the buyer doesn't get possession on the agreed delivery date.*"	Games	Games	-1

I think that simply applies to the factor human. Most humans think they learn applicable skills in university and just the great minority is genuinely passionate for the topic before studying it. That will remain truth no matter how many people are taught basics.

It's easily 90% of students who just study something for someone else told them that is a good lucrative future to pursue, that's it. They've no clue about it and they won't be able to do things post graduation either and that's the typical mediocre dev you find - people who are worse then the passionate 15 yo teenager who just reads tutorials and knows to code after a year.

197	"&gt;I'm saying that, objectively, the ""events of creation"" portion is false. Completely, absolutely, factually false. All available evidence and logic make this as close to certain as we can be about anything. 

The statement you are quoting says nothing about whether the text is or is not true or even what the reader is 'supposed' to get from it. I was only responding to somebody who wanted me to remind them whether the text should be read literally or figuratively. I provided a perspective on reading the words.

Here is the only statement I made that you could infer is me telling you what you're 'supposed' to get out of the text, from my initial post:

&gt;Where do we even begin to comprehend deity? With what he has given to us of his divine nature, namely scripture.  

It's a book designed to help us to comprehend the deity of God and his divine nature. Honestly, and I'm being entirely sincere here, you have a choice on what you get from the text. You can either approach it with honest curiosity as an academic would approach a text, or you can approach it dishonestly, bringing presumptions and biases into it with you. It's entirely your choice.

The Bible describes God's relationship with humanity from creation to the end times. The Old Testament should be read from an Ancient Near Eastern perspective and the New Testament from a Late Antiquity Perspective. In this way, you can try to understand how it's original audience would've read/heard it and it's original authors would have written it.

As far as telling you what you're 'supposed' to get from the text, I would encourage you to read it for yourself first. That way you will have an authentic reading without my perspective meddling with it. If you choose not to do so, then that is just fine with me as well!"

Not that there are no benefits in joining a community of like minded people to strengthen your growth and knowledge, I only want to address the tendency to give up your own authority to decide what is right, what is true, how to behave, or the truth of love and life. Don't depend on any external power or authority to tell you the truth of your being.

I recommend not to seek the reality of Love outside in any churches or dogmas, not to trust in any rituals, myths or agendas but to seek Love at the only place where it resides, seek it in the wisdom of your own heart and let Love teach you of itself.

Indeed, God is Love. But unfortunately, the word 'God' has been associated with so many negative things now that when you mention it, people immediately think of punishment, cruelty, egotistical maniac, or condemnation and judgement.

I am not a Christian, nor a Bible scholar, but I believe there is a verse in the Bible that says: ""God is love and he who abides in Love, abides in God and God abides in him."" 

But sadly, not many religions nowadays adheres to this principle. Many churches are now only trying to extend their own agenda, to maintain their position and power or manipulation of the mass, so many unthinkable deeds had been done in the name of God. 

But truly, Love is the major principle of the One Fundamental Energy, that I shall call Divine Consciousness. Of course, as the One Central Energy is Life itself, it embodies all characteristics of all beings within the omniverse, but its major principles are very few and Love is perhaps its most important expression.

Other sublime qualities of Divine Consciousness are absolute Truth, Intelligence, Omniscience, Joy, Compassion...etc. 

Great Avatars have come and taught the appropriate message tailored to the people with respect to their abilities, cultural tendency and geological regions so there are many approaches to the One. 

Major Avatars who exhibit this sublime quality of Divine Love are Sri Ramakrishna(1836 - 1886) of India and Jeshua ben Joseph of Nazareth or better known as his english name Jesus the Christ.(4 BC - 30 AD)

Unlike the Buddha Gautama(563 BC - 483 BC), who emanates the Omniscience aspect of the Godhood, Ramakrishna and Jesus concentrated on Love, the highest non-egoistical form, which in its final development makes the man a sage, i.e. a perfect being. 

""Love thy neighbor as thyself"", and ""A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another"" said Jesus somewhere in the bible. 

However, it is rather difficult nowadays to find a church that adheres to the true teaching of Jesus Christ.  Many Christian churches are consumed in power and greed to further their religious heresy and maintain their wealth. These churches are a disgrace to the name of the Christ. 

That said, if you seek to grow within a community, the Unity Church seems to embody the loving message of Christ very closely, with major stresses on love, forgiveness, acceptance of all people etc...

They offer very good teaching of the Christ Jesus. There are others too but I don't have much knowledge about them to recommend. 

You may find some teachings of the current Dalai Lama very helpful. Compassion is one of his major themes. 

The highest treasure though are the unseen teachings scattered around the world, but are unnoticed by the public eye and only appear to those who have eyes and ears to seek them.

* Salesperson
* Broker

Salespersons need to work for a broker who ""holds their license"". Salespersons can not trade in real estate without a broker holding their license, and agreeing to oversee their activities. To become a broker, you need to pass three college classes, and pass a state exam.

To be a broker requires 2 years of experience and/or a 4-year degree, 8 college classes, and passing  state exam that fails about 70% of all test takers. It's a hard license to get as with it you can handle your own escrows, hold trust accounts, and employ other salespersons.

An ""agent"" is just a colloquial term for real estate agents that include both salespersons and brokers.

All REALTORS are Real Estate Agents (Salespersons/Brokers), but not all Real Estate Agents are REALTORS. To become a REALTOR, you must be licensed by your state, then you need to voluntarily join your local, state and federal board of REALTORS, and agree to follow the code of ethics. To be a REALTOR requires you to agree to run your business with rules that are far and wide more restrictive than what the state law would require.

Basically, you want to deal with a REALTOR. And, in California, you probably want to deal with a broker. AND, if you can find one, someone with the CRS designation would be a slam dunk :)

"It probably varies by district and generation. All I know is that pretty much the only history I learned which wasn't quite as sugar coated was probably from film (Dances with Wolves, and various westerns (not saying that this wasn't dramatized or had facts skewed, only that it mentioned parts of history which were not known to me previously)) long before the school system even mentioned these parts of American History. Maybe the earliest part where there was even mention of some of the genocide being conducted as part of Manifest Destiny was in my later years of highschool, where it was still fairly minimal. I still have a social studies text book from the 5th grade sitting around somewhere, so can even go back and see if memory holds up to evidence (if I can find the darn thing). Unfortunately McGraw-Hill doesn't seem to have an online archive of old textbooks available.

The main problem, really, is that the curriculum is just so tight, with most of American History being focused on the Colonial times and Civil War just because the school is trying to prime children as much as possible for a mandatory citizenship test in 7th grade. Before highschool, the Korean and Vietnam war got essentially no discussion or even mention, and can only imagine that primary school students are getting almost nothing about any of the Gulf wars either.

People will disagree with this analogy, and it’s not completely on point, but I think about it like I think about a taco truck.  When I’m sober, I’d never go near one of those things — the food is greasy and cheesy and must be 1000 calories a bite.  But drunk me loves them — drunk me will walk 20 blocks for one.  That I would never eat that stuff sober, and that I often wake up thinking “oh my god why did I go to the taco truck again?,” doesn’t mean that I don’t consent.

The same is true if I get moderately drunk and decide to agree to sex because it seems like a good idea.  I’m not out cold, I’m not beyond understanding, but I’m feeling good and making choices I might not otherwise make, and that I might later regret.  Sure, sober me wouldn’t do it.

Why are you arguing as if I believe what you believe?  

You seem to be acting like ""Islam"" means ""The Truth"" and me calling Salafism Islam means I'm sayying Salafism is truth.

Islam is a name for a religion, within which there are multiple variants of belief, just as there are more than one denomination in christianity, more than one school of thought in Judaism and Buddhism.

Every religion has these different schools, and in every religion, at most one of these many variants of belief can be right.

Do you think that both Sunnis and Shias are Islam? Because if Islam is right, well one of these variants must be believing in something wrong.

Why is it so hard to wrap your head around the idea that Salafis could be Muslims, but very very wrong Muslims who aren't doing what Allah wants?

Do you think Catholics think Protestants do everything right?
No. Once upon a time they killed each other over their heresy...
But they are still both regarded as being Christians.

342	"Absolutely. While there are some good events (particularly in Vabbi), the vast majority are painfully bad in comparison to core Tyria ones.

Some examples:

* NPCs for events frequently spawn in and out in totally random location. In core Tyria most event NPCs exist in the world until their event starts, and hang around afterwards (sometimes to sell event-themed items). But in Path of Fire they will just despawn in the middle of a road, or behind some random pipe. Even when npcs in core tyria despawn, they always made sure to have them run into doors/waypoints so that it made sense for them to be hidden.

* Some events are on timers for literally no reason. Even if someone starts participating in an event, they will sometimes just time out when they're halfway done, wasting that person's time. And this isn't to make way for some other event, they just randomly have timers.

* Chained events are almost non-existent outside of the very simple metas. Further, a lot of these events just happen without any particular story, or they just throw waves of enemies at you every 10 minutes or so. While this structure is present in core Tyria, there is almost always a story-related reason for it and crucially the state of the world changes if they are failed. In PoF the state of the world almost NEVER changes in response to an event - succeed or fail the same outcome results.

&amp;nbsp;

Guild Wars 2 sold itself on the idea of a dynamic, adapting world. This is almost completely absent in the vast majority of PoF events. NPCs appear from nowhere, do something meaningless and without context, nothing changes, and they despawn again. I think the events have been much better in living world, but it is a real shame that the expansion (where they should have time for more detailed quests) is so lacking them."

As for the appraisal question, the answer is 'sort of'. Artificial diamonds are pretty much indistinguishable from the natural variety. To combat this, most artificial diamonds are laser etched with a serial number so they can be tracked. That serial # is small enough that it won't be seen by most appraisers.

361	"It is. For most of human history, people have had to share living spaces in order to make those living spaces work. Just imagine how Irish, Italian, and Mexican immigrants to the United States over the past century have lived in homes housing up to 20 family members.

Another way of thinking about it is this: think about the cost and labor needed to build a studio or one bedroom apartment. Building the foundation, bringing in cement and wood planks from around the country on a truck, the hard labor of hitting nails with hammers all day long, the cost and labor of installing walls, insulation, flooring, carpets, plumbing, electrical wires, internet cables, etc.

Now think about whether someone is willing to *trade* the final product of that labor for the final product of someone working a minimum wage job. If the apartment lasts for 100 years without needing additional work, then we're talking about trading in millions of pounds of cement and wood and tens of thousands of hours of back-breaking labor in exchange for 100 years of people grabbing burgers, putting it in a bag, and handing it to you through a window. 

There are other people out there that will pay a lot more to the people who build the house, to the people who cut down the trees and turn them into wooden planks, to the people who mine the limestone and gravel and convert it into cement with some heat, to the people who mine the iron ore that turns into the metal pipes that carry your water, and to the people who mine the copper and fabricate the plastics that turn into coaxial cables for your internet connection.

Those laborers are being told ""you need to work for less"" whenever someone says that ""a minimum wage job should be able to afford someone a one-bedroom apartment""."	Haha joke's on you.

1. A personal story that actually guided you through the maps, seamlessly leading you to ever-higher areas. The butchery to the current system gutted the relevance of rewards (By the time you finish a chapter, the rewards are 5 levels out of date), and, instead of providing guidance through the world, enforced backtracking. I just had two friends express interest in the game but quit because of the complete lack of guidance 1-20, because the level 10 story is just a starting zone runaround. So, fuck you, whichever asshole decided dumping chapters on players at once and gutting the game's guidance was better than players having to level up a bit more if they're blazing through the instances too fast (Or try a chapter underleveled)
2. World bosses were not on a timer, and instead provided an engaging challenge to players who sought out their initiating events on the map at the time. Now they're just AFK loot pinatas. (my friends were unlucky enough to stumble across the Frozen Maw world boss. They were NOT impressed)
3. it was actually possible to catch the kegs in Wayfarer Foothills. Difficult, but possible.

"&gt; As an FYI, a good frugal solution could’ve been to have them over for dinner.  A good home cooked meal would have been much cheaper and shows your friend you are making an effort not only to see them but also do something nice for them. 

I actually have issues with this as well. I have a friend who doesn't ever want to eat food made at home and vociferously dissents when it comes up, even wanting to pay for my meal rather than eating something his wife cooks at home, or something I cook when he visits. 

Both me and his wife love to cook and are probably more skilled than average. I have friends over *to* cook for and with. It's actually really frustrating because it also becomes an issue with other social things like potlucks on game nights, complaining until everyone just agrees that we'll order pizza instead.

407	"&gt; I went to a party this one night with one of the friends he told me to cut contact with and I was super drunk and messed around with some guys after he told me not to do anything with anybody

If I'm reading this correctly, this was before you two even started dating, meaning he has no right to dictate your behavior. If he didn't like what you were doing or who you were hanging out with he could choose not to begin dating you.

&gt; He told me to cut contact with that friend because she was the one handing me drinks and he thought she was a bad influence.

You're in college, getting drunk at parties is normal. Unless YOU were saying that you didn't like the influence this friend had on you, it's not his place to judge that.

&gt; As for another friend, he thought that she was a snake and a horrible friend as she was telling my bf's friend about the stuff I vented to her about my boyfriend

I mean, from the sound of it he was pretty controlling of you before you even started dating, so I am inclined to bet that this was out of concern for your well-being. Unless she was disclosing details of your sex life or something, it's not snaky to relay worrisome facts about someone's behavior.

&gt; She used him for his weed as he would say and so he thought I shouldn't be friends with her even though we grew really close.

He doesn't get to decide who your friends are just because he doesn't like them for whatever dumb reason. Honestly, this sounds to me like an excuse to isolate you further from your friends.

&gt; Even a couple months ago I found that he had texted one of his girl friends something that was borderline cheating.

409	"There is no logical reason why a person can't grow up both French and Spanish - as OP is an example of.  She grew up part of both the hearing and the Deaf cultures.

But in a way, the existence of the cochlear implant really does threaten the Deaf culture.  Now, in the real world the cochlear implant does't help 100% of deaf people.  Sometimes ear works fine and the brain just doesn't/can't interpret the sounds, and in that case an implant will not help, since it's basically a new ear. 
 But imagine that it did help 100% of deaf people, and imagine that at some point in the future all deaf babies were given an implant at birth.  Deaf culture would eventually disappear.  There would be no more need for sign language, and it's that language that essentially allows Deaf culture to exist.

There's a lot of ""ifs"" and ""eventuallies"" here.  But it's a real fear of some Deaf people, and understandably so.

It's not about logic.  It's all about that fear, really.  It's the fear that the cochlear implant represents the end of Deaf culture in some distant future, and the fear that some day cochlear implants may become mandatory.  A lot of hearing people don't understand that Deafness is a culture, and they see it only as an impairment, and they would consider it cruelty to allow a child to grow up deaf when they could have an implant and be allowed to hear.

In a way, cochlear implants represent one culture (the hearing world) trying to tell another culture (the Deaf world) that they are wrong.  It's akin to straight people telling gay people that they can't marry, because homosexuality is wrong.

For the record, my opinion is that nobody should be forced to have a cochlear implant, or be forced to give their kid one, but that parents who refuse to do so are robbing their child of an opportunity.  I think that yes, Deaf culture may eventually die out as cochlear implants gain popularity, but cultures evolve and change and die all the time in the real world.  It's sad, but that's the way things go."	"What makes you think I’m outraged? I’m trying to understand your opinion.

415	Basically all trauma has variable effects depending on circumstances on the formation of your right brain/limbic system that result in various issues of emotion regulation. Living in chronic stress and an abusive household can have effects ranging from personality disorders, to PTSD, to bipolar/schizo, and even autism in a subgroup of people. All of these things  cause certain malformations or under/over development of right brain circuitry, where you process basically everything dealing with emotions from facial expressions to vocal tones to attachment schemes and really anything that's become associated with an emotional state like dropping a glass if historically that got you threatened. In short, without help, these things tend to follow you into your adult life and affect your relationships with others and yourself, at least when your abusers were also your caretakers, i.e. attachment trauma. In the case of BPD for example there is an 80% intergenerational inheritance rate. So, yes, these things can definitely be heritable. There's no surprise that bipolar and schizophrenia too have high heritability and one of the best prophylactics for schizophrenia is a supportive family.

For any recommendations, read the wiki	"You don't have to cite an article to know kipping pullups increase the risk of shoulder impingement. That doesn't mean kipping pullups shouldn't be an exercise. Doing strict handstands and playing volleyball also increase the chance of shoulder impingements. That doesn't mean they shouldn't exist.

If your goal is getting big/strong you can replace kipping pullups with exercises that are both more effective and reduce the risk of secondairy shoulder impingement.

If your goal is performing an act that features a similar movement, training dynamic whole body flexion and extension or winning a crossfit competition it's good to practice kipping pullups.

I think the kipping pullup has a very valid place in the arsenal of human movement and there is nothing inherently bad about the movement. That said it's important to realise the high mobility, coordination and strength demands to perform the movement properly. Therefor teaching it to relatively untrained people and letting them perform for time is a bad idea.

Btw. The article didn't look at kipping pullups but different hand positions. You can argue increased humeral elevation is present in a kipping pullup but that isn't necessarily the case and the majority of the pulling is done in decreased humeral elevation."	Fitness	Fitness	-1
417	"&gt;So you end up doing your joins every time.

If nationality is only relevant user profile pages, why would I be joining into the nationality tables in other features? Each of my users has a lot of different pieces of data associated with them (posts, reports, personal application preferences, friends, replies, messages, etc.). The notion that I have to join into every single one of these when loading every single page in a large feature is plainly false. I query only the data I need, which means I **must** have the ability to construct joins on the fly, not deal with a bunch of irrelevant data.

&gt; as you have to join on the same table twice

?

    SELECT
        u.*, n.*
    FROM
        users u
    INNER JOIN
        user_nationalities un
    ON
        u.id = un.user_id
    INNER JOIN
        nationalities n
    ON
        n.id = un.nationality_id
    WHERE
        n.label = ""German""
    GROUP BY
        u.id;

&gt; which a lot of query libraries are bad at

Most query libraries let you alias tables with any name you want, or assign distinct aliases automatically. The difference between JOINing into the same table twice and two different tables is trivial.

&gt; You have to update the index for every new user either way

Actually you don't have to do anything. Your database does it for you. With NoSQL you either need to be absolutely sure that you are *always* either updating users through a common abstraction that handles index updates, or calling your user index update immediately after your user record update unless you can tolerate your indexes becoming out of sync. I will take the peace of mind of my RDBMS handling index updates for me over the theoretical need to delay index updates.

&gt; With NoSQL you can plan for that kind of thing

With SQL you can also plan for large operations (be it schema changes or long running reports).

&gt; Whereas a traditional RDBMS will happily silently accept your badly-written reporting query 

Write and run the code to do it, and NoSQL will happily accept just about any operation at any time."	"There’s a particularly interesting fix here where they introduce a bug into double/single handling to match the Wii VC for super mario 64 that enables a 0-a presses speedrun.

In that way, they are still choosing, and they could choose to disbelieve, but they have an easier choice to believe based upon what evidence is available to them - it would be unreasonable to disbelieve unless they found more compelling evidence to disbelieve.

My husband had yesterday and today off.  He works 70+ hour weeks so I am the main caretaker for our children and because I am a school teacher I never get a day off without kids.  I also take care of the house.  

Today at 10 am I realized I forgot my lunch and texted asking if he could bring it to me.  He replied that he couldn’t didn’t tell me why and refused to answer any calls or text for the rest of the day.  After school I had another presentation and then I picked up the kids.  When we arrived home at 6pm he was just getting out of bed and told me he had been drinking so he couldn’t bring me lunch because he couldn’t drive.  

I’m not upset he wasn’t drunk driving but usually on his days off I ask him to join me for lunch just so we can spend time together since he works so much.  Am I an asshole for being angry that he got drunk instead of helping me today?"	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	-1

That suggests that opinions you have become versed in are the most prevalent among Christians (no source given to verify), or that even if it is the most widely held belief, that suv a belief is consistent with what the Bible actually says. 

For example on that last one, it is true that a very significant number of ""religious people"" think that the only requirement to having a good spiritual life is to be moral and do good deeds. However the Bible does not support that idea at all.

But we are drifting. You are convinced that this is the only possible reality, and I think it may be impossible to convince you otherwise. But you go further to say that Christianity can't believe in an infinite, while I (a Biblical literalist) am saying the infinite must be.

437	"&gt; &gt;Atheism is a belief that there are no gods.

&gt;That's your definition of atheism. You are not the one to decide what we believe and what atheism means.

That's not *my* definition, that's *the* definition for some 500 years now. 

In as much as you want to trust etymology on line, 

&gt; atheist (n.) 1570s, ""godless person, one who denies the existence of a supreme, intelligent being to whom moral obligation is due,"" from French &gt;athéiste (16c.), from Greek atheos ""without god, denying the gods; abandoned of the gods; godless, ungodly,"" from a- ""without"" (see a- (3)) + &gt; theos ""a god"" (from PIE root *dhes-, forming words for religious concepts). 

Can't find some earlier uses of atheist that make it clear that atheist = does not believe God exists, but here are actual dictionary entries

Websters 1828 Dictionary of the English Language
&gt; Atheist

&gt; A'THEIST, noun [Gr. of a priv. and God.]
&gt; One who disbelieves the existence of a God, or Supreme intelligent Being.
&gt;
&gt; A'THEIST, adjective Atheistical; disbelieving or denying the being of a Supreme God.

&gt; DISBELIEVE, verb transitive [dis and believe.] Not to believe; to hold not to be true or not to exist; to refuse to credit. Some men disbelieve the inspiration of the scriptures, and the immortality of the soul.



Dictionary of the English language by Samuel Johnson 1768, 3rd edition
&gt; ATHEIST One that denies existence of a God Bentley 


&gt; DISBELIEF To disbelieve; credit denial of belief.  To DISBELIEVE va dis and believe to credit not to hold true


Dictionary of the English language by Samuel Johnson &amp; John Walker (1828 edition)

&gt; Atheism n The disbelief of a God 
&gt; Atheist n One that denies the existence of God 

Webster's Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 1989

&gt; Atheism: 1. the doctrine or belief that there is no god. 2. The disbelief in the existence of Gods. 

It is also ridiculous for Huxley to coin a word for his position that he did not accept the position of either atheists or theists if atheist meant not having a belief,  

&gt; When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. **They were quite sure they had attained a certain ""gnosis,""—had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence**; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. 

So atheists of his time were sure about something, they had *gnosis* aka knowledge of it, plus atheist is atheos-ist not a - theist, but everyone is wrong all this time until some random people on the internet set several hundred years straight? 

&gt;  I have to agree with my fellow atheists: it's us to decide how atheism is defined. We don't define Christianity the way we want. Christians define the word.

First, that's AKA the no true Scotsman fallacy, which Christians are accused of all the time by atheists. Second, language is agreed upon, so a band of supposed atheists cannot change the meaning of the word for all atheists let alone for everyone one when the word was perfectly sound previously. 

&gt; &gt; It's funny how everyone new here has the wrong definition of atheist

&gt; Or: you have the wrong definition.

""Me"" has nothing to do with it. When people outside of this sub come in using the same definition of atheist that I've now shown to be THE definition of atheist of record, and are corrected hear of what atheist ""really means"" by ""atheists"" using incorrect etymology, the problem is not them, but the minority here. **it's no longer a case of ""agnostic atheists"" choosing a label for themselves, it's a case of historical revisionism in order to avoid having to argue the position of believing there's no god.** "	Do atheists even understand the atheist position?

[The American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-CitzenshipQuestion.pdf) wrote to Secretary Ross (who has also expressed similar concerns) that the addition of the question would negatively impact the accuracy of the census. Now, I have a degree in social science methodology, but AMSA is a completely different level of mathematical expertise. Additionally, they rely on the accuracy of public demographic information for everything. There is no doubt in my mind, or theirs, that including the question would make the census less accurate. So, to justify the addition of the question legally, you need to justify why getting less accurate data is better than not asking the citizenship question.

&gt;the problems remains, we need to know how many illegal aliens are in our country.

The American Communities Survey asks the same questions and regularly collects the same data. The difference is that there is a better time frame to collect the data so field observers can often administer the survey itself and ensure people understand the government can't use the data to hunt them down. It is highly unlikely that many illegal immigrants will answer a census document that asks them to disclose their status without being able to ask legal questions to observers or surveyors.

If your goal is to assess how many illegal immigrants there are, the ACS does that. Thus, the legal justification to make the census less accurate is absolved.

&gt;And is it fair that areas that are heavily populated by illegal aliens get more of a voice in Washington or more government funding?

It doesn't matter if its fair, it matters what the law says. The Constitution requires an ""actual Enumeration"" of ""people,"" not citizens. If you don't like that, you should propose a Constitutional Amendment. The *American* children of illegal immigrants still go to schools and need healthcare. Moreover, illegal immigrants pay federal, state, sales, and local taxes without getting access to most state or federal entitlement benefits. Most of them are paying into a system they will never benefit from. If anything, it is unfair to exclude them from the census.

&gt;IMHO illegal alien populations should not effect things like the number of delegates a state gets, for example.

I don't know what to tell you. Your social contract says they should. They may not be able to vote, but they still live in these places and pay their taxes. What you are suggesting is taxation without representation. That seems pretty un-American.

There are ways to change how the census works, doing it maliciously and illegally seems like a hard sell to me. I'm sure the fact that some Central American people want to live in the United States infuriates you, but that isn't a reason to fuck up the census. The only reason to change the census would be to make it more accurate or fill in gaps in the ACS. This does neither."	politics	politics	-1

If the former, then I don't think Delta (which I am a business traveler of) will work for you. In order for you to get Delta status, you have to BOTH fly a certain amount of miles AND spend a certain amount of dollars. If someone else is paying for your travel, I'm guessing you will only get the miles flown, which means you will never get status on that airline.

I don't know about United and Southwest, apologies.

If you're looking to only collect miles, I think the question is what you want to use them for and where you want to go. Delta and United both offer good options for international travel. If you want to save miles for an int'l ticket, I'd advise you to go with one of those. The issue is that you're probably going to have to do a good amount of traveling before you rack up enough miles for a decent int'l ticket.

Money is not an issue. This is what I am thinking of doing:

**November 18 - 27:** Land in Medellín, stay there with a day trip to Guatapé and another to Jardín.

**November 27 - December 2:** Fly out to Cartagena and stay there and visit the Rosario Islands.

**December 2:** Fly back home

How does this look? Any other day trips I could do?

I read a lot of good things about Salento, the Valle de Cocora hike, Santa Marta, and Tayrona but would it be worth trying to fit one of them in with the short amount of time I have? Maybe completely cut out Cartagena?

I also heard Bogota wasn't worth going to for an extended amount of time so I'm thinking of just skipping it, thoughts?

I would love to see a study that compares cookie feeding ratings in a longitudinal study because I suspect that:

A) Liking is reciprocal and thus a student that gets cookies might get more out of a class because students learn better from teachers they like.

B) The cookie effect will dissipate once you get more data of the same teacher.

C) Cookie bribes would only change the baseline. The crucial mistake would be of the institution. Scoring the class is non-comparitive, at least in the minds of students. If the school believes their scale of 0 - 10 is the same as the one the student filled in they are in for a surprise."	"And Im saying ok to that.

485	"&gt;All they are doing is increasing the scarcity of equity available on the open market. A price increase caused by scarcity is only economically beneficial if it is prompting some increase in production and supply in response. If it's not causing an increase in supply then it's actually economically harmful. Stock buybacks do not prompt any increase in supply, in fact their entire purpose is to limit supply for the benefit of equity holders. It is an example of cartel like behavior where investors are simply increasing the price of owning corporate equity without actually causing any increase in value.

&gt;Does that strike you as sound economic logic? 

I don't think your characterization is sound at all.  In fact I find it downright strange.  

&gt;A price increase caused by scarcity is only economically beneficial if it is prompting some increase in production and supply in response.

Possibly true, but that increase doesn't need to be in the original market.  It can be almost anywhere.  Some public firms will increase investment, others without sound projects return money to shareholders where it finds its way into higher value investment opportunities.  That does not have to be in the publicly traded equities, but much of it undoubtedly will.

503	"No one really knows what vocations are available to you except cmpb, it really depends on the needs of the army. Infantry is a given, theres always a need for more infantry specs. Altho if you get jnfantry and get posted to tekong thats a very different life versus being posted to one of the infantry battalions. The rest really depends on where there is a need. The thing about your vocation being determined prior to enlistment isnt true. 

We cant tell you which coy is more slack because OCs and regulars change all the time. But in general SCS is more chill than bmt- youre expected to be a future commander so in general you have at least some freedom to make your own calls about canteen break/emart/admin time. My PC was good, so long as we got our shit done and turned up for training the rest was up to us. 

As camps go, PLC isnt actually that bad a camp, so be careful what you wish for regarding getting a vocation thats not in infantry for pro term. If you end up in armor and going gedong you will wish you stayed in PLC, for example. Then again you could strike gold and get chong pang camp or something.

Did infantry pro term and later fot posted to 1SIR. Not gonna lie to you, infantry is a hard life, lots of outfield/marching and none of the glitz/glamour of armor/guards/commando. Becoming a commander has responsibilities and priviliges. Yes you can OOC/CK now and have a relatively easier life now versus pushing through SCS and getting some say about how you run your life back later on (and more money). I find its also much more productive than being a commander some clerk or saikamg storeman in terms of your personal development. If youre a clerk or similar you may have alot of free time but few nsfs have discipline to use that free time productively, whereas if you're a commander you do have actual responsibility and learning experiences which will help you later in life."

Why would I do that... her believing in them didn’t hurt me and brought her joy, so why would I want to take that from her?

When she died, I resolved to be the man I should have been for her.  But my current wife would say I still do some of the things you’re talking about... even though I’m conscious of the fact that I took a previous girlfriend for granted and am very motivated to change.

One of the things I would ask you to think about is that we love the person that is, not the person we want them to be.  I suspect these things that are bothering you are not new things he just started doing... if that’s the case, and you’ve been happy for 12 years, what has changed?  If that’s the case, is it right to be upset or angry if you haven’t talked to him and told him in clear, plain language that you want something different from him?

I think it’s also important to recognize that two people can love each other in completely different ways but that doesn’t mean one loves the other more.  I suspect that him wanting to watch your movies with you is more important to you than him actually watching the movies, because you want to do things for him and you think he loves you less if he doesn’t want to do things for you.

Maybe you should talk about this more, during the day time.  "	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	-1

He keeps insisting on this position because he thinks it'll make me cum but it's really just not working anymore.

This doesn't make any sense.  We're talking about using a larger sensor, so your analogy implies a differently sized bucket.  That's the point.  Just upping the size of the sensor doesn't make anything brighter.  The subset of the new, larger sensor that was there before is still lit to the same brightness, it's just that the new areas are *also* lit to that same brightness."

523	"I get the frustration of your store not being a WPN member and therefore not getting promos like this,  but that very example proves that it isn't just about selling boxes. If it were strictly about selling boxes, the promos would be made available to any store that sold the product, not just WPN members. By making this promotion for WPN members it is WotC supporting LGSs, not just places that sell product, but places where the game is played. This encourages stores to host events and become WPN members. If you want to support your comic book store, but still want promos in the future, talk to them about becoming WPN members.

And, I can't stress this enough, this promotion does not in anyway directly result in more money for WotC. All of what they initially move is predetermined by contracts they have with distributors, that is not impacted by the retail level. These initial print runs are going to sell out with or without promos. WotC is going to make their money. What makes them more money (or costs them money) is interest in the product further after release, long after the promos run out, when the only thing selling the product is the quality of the product itself.

This promotion is for the benefit of LGSs (specifically WPN members. Yes, WotC benefits in the long term, because more stores are going to be WPN members, meaning more places are going to run events, meaning more opportunities to play, more people getting introduced, and an increased demand for product, but they will in no way directly profit from this promotion. That is all for the benefit of LGSs, getting box sales, and specifically preorders to help get their equity out of being tied up in product, and able to reinvest.

WotC is far from perfect. This promotion isn't perfect. But it is not cynical. It is not a bad thing. It really does help with stores.

If you don't want to buy, or can't afford to buy a box, these will certainly be available for purchase on the secondhand market. The fact that it will mainly only see play in singleton formats will help keep the price down. And I know you said you won't believe it until you see it, but they have said if the cards are in demand they can and likely will be reprinted, and I have no choice but to take them on their word for this. To demonstrate how they are on keeping their promises, I point to the Reserved List. At MaRo's panel this past weekend, one of the things he said was that if he could go back in time, he would prevent the RL from happening. They realize the problems and the frustration it causes, but it was a promise they made, a promise that many people made financial decisions on, and to go back on it would be a violation to them. So, I know they can keep their word, because they do it, even when it is to their detriment."	Sounds like he may be excited for the Simic!

Keep very hydrated because when I was done with sessions my clothes would add a whopping 2-3 lbs because of all the sweat (gym was always warm which made it worse).

The biggest thing in my opinion was cutting out the garbage from my diet (pizza, Chinese food, fried buffalo wings, beer/soda, potato chips, etc.). I took my diet to the extreme at first by limiting myself to &lt;1500 calories made up of as much protein as possible and no carbs + biking. You WILL feel like absolute shit if you do that, but I was dumb and thought “less calories is more weight loss, right?” It was a big mistake I’ve learned from. 

so I’d advise cutting out as much sugar as possible, limiting carbs, incorporating a lot of greens, and having lots of smart snacks. I realized it was more expensive to eat healthy but it’s for your health. One of my favorites was venison jerky which is extremely lean, delicious, and a very easy snack.

EDIT: also, longer sessions have a compounded effect of after burn. Keeping my heart rate that high for that long while drinking loads of water (1-2 gallons a day depending on how much I worked out.

As you can see we only have four pixels or data points(observed isotopes) in moscoviums column.

Why do you believe this? Sure, we have not discovered everything, but there is no evidence to support a belief that there is an unknown force. We don't know what it is that we don't know, and so it is an act of faith to believe that one of the things that we don't know is a force.

And why call it a higher power (a term generally only used when trying to hide the fact that the person is referring to a god)? The four fundamental forces of the universe are never described as a higher power. So why believe that an unknown potential force is a higher power.

I was trying to explain that the idea of God knowing a person's future is a concept of its own, and is independent, or above anything else. Which is what I was trying to get at when I said this:

&gt; You commit a sin, based on your own free will (assuming it exists), then you go to hell, and ""then"" God knows about it billions of years ago.

Regarding this point that you made:

&gt;well then the whole plot is pre-determined in advance and the characters in the movie have no way to deviate from that pre-determined plot.

An analogy should only go as far as it was intended. Not everything in an analogy should be considered as equivalent, which is what makes it an analogy. I have explained my point differently in my other comment to OP where I've explained what I was trying to get at with that."	"&gt; The assumption in the OP question is the the belief was true, not that these people knew the belief was true.

The assumption in the OP question is that the two James's were presenting themselves as eyewitnesses of the events they claimed to believe and that they died on the basis of the belief. That's the clear subtext of OPs question and a common argument presented as evidence for the resurrection... I know you don't find it compelling and I don't blame you... but that *is* the argument. 

&gt;  Julius Caesar actually wrote books, and we have primary accounts of what was happening in the Roman Empire.

Exactly my point... we know what happened on the basis of primary accounts including Julius Caesar's own book. We know what was in that book on the basis of some very good manuscript evidence: 12 manuscripts the earliest of which is from the 9th century.... yes Virginia, that is considered good and reliable evidence when you're talking about ancient documents.

&gt; To say Jesus is a god or the God is an extraordinary claim, and you have to give us extraordinary evidence.

I didn't make that claim as a matter of historical record though I happen to believe it as a matter of religious faith. 

But I think it's worth noting that *you* are willing to believe that Julius Caesar wrote his account of the Gallic wars and that the text we have is roughly correct on the basis of 12(!) manuscripts the very oldest one we have being transcribed 900 years(!) after his death.

My point as you well know is NOT that we have any reason to doubt the historicity of Caesar or to seriously doubt what he wrote in his account of the Gallic wars. It's to point out your astounding double standard when it comes to assessing the reliability of the text based upon manuscript evidence. The Bible is absolutely unique when it comes to the level of manuscript evidence we have. We have 5,800 greek manuscripts, another 10,000 latin ones, and another ~10K or so in various other languages.... ignore the translations and you're still talking more than twice what have for the nearest competitor: 2000 manuscripts of the Illiad. With the oldest fragmentary papyri of the Illiad being a mere 400 years after Homer's death as opposed to less than a century with the New Testament making the Illiad by far the best attested document we have from the ancient world. For all the rest of ancient literature you're talking about hundreds of manuscripts for the best attested but more often mere dozens and 1000 years or more between the oldest copy we have and the original being written. 

If we consistently applied your level of skepticism about manuscript evidence to every other document and you'd have to throw out almost everything in your history books before the renaissance and a good deal of what came after."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

So, she will likely at some point start making wages. You can get a garnishment order easily. You just have to send it to her employer. Alternatively, she can agree to make monthly payments on a voluntary basis. Its her choice.

Appearance is mandatory. If she doesn't go, she'll have a warrant for her arrest. She'll have to go eventually.

I'm not sure how I moved the goal posts by using your example in another industry that's well known to query how it could not logically apply there but applies to your example.

I therefore didn't put words in your mouth as I asked a direct question if you would also consider Starbucks employees for example or nestle employees as ass holes.

I can be more direct and ask ""so do you think this opinion equally applies to all industries"" as there are numerous industries with disreputable companies with arsehole for a Ceo which many people work for.

You are not going to get me to believe that everyone who works in the trump administration, many of whom I'm sure held the job whilst Obama was also in power, are arseholes, and should quit their job and undergo financial strain whilst they look for a new one because you don't like trump.

However if you think that's what they should do, that's fine, that's your opinion and I don't agree with it.

I do believe you can work for somewhere without signing up to its beliefs, that's how you can get bad employees at popular, decent chains, and good employees at shitty places like comcast, or if these goal posts are too far away for you by now, ICE for that matter.

587	"I assure you, blizzard saw diablo as a failure *entirely* because of its shallow gameplay.

A game that generated *over* 1 billion dollars couldn't possibly be seen as a failure of monetizing, I don't care what the medium is. No company on the planet would consider 1+ billion dollars made as a failure in any regard.

Also, they *did* monetize diablo, even after it generated the mentioned billion dollars. It was called the auction house. It was a place where people could sell in-game items for real money and blizzard took a cut of every single transaction. The absolute pinnacle of monetizing a loot based ARPG is having a system that lets your players sell their virtual items for real money and then taking a portion of that money. They couldn't have monetized diablo any better...

Then, when RoS came out, they *removed* the auction house. Remember why? Because people were farming the auction house and not actually *playing* the game. That means blizzard cared more about whether or not people were playing their game, not whether or not they were continuing to make money from the game.

Blizzard did not fail to monetize diablo. They failed to make a good game that kept people interested. Because of this failure, they actually removed the feature that was providing a constant income in order to make the game more enjoyable. Diablo 4 will not have microtransactions and will be made for people to play and enjoy, not to siphon money from."	all i can say is im sorry and good luck to you.

590	"I don't think many of these terms are what you think they mean.

**Superposition** refers to states in linear systems, where you have two decoupled states.  For example, Rotational and linear motion are decoupled, and thus, a Frisbee is in a superposition of rolling and traveling.  This applies to quantum states because Schrodinger's equation is linear, and so you have two solutions, you can add them together and form a new solution.

**Observation** changes experiments because you necessarily affect systems you are trying to take readings from.  If you want to look at something, you need to ensure there are photons bouncing off of it.  The act of having photons bouncing off of it changes the object.  Sure, photons are already bouncing off of your object, so in this case, observation does not change the object.  But now lets pretend you are in a pitch black room, and you shine a light on something.  Now that something is changed by shining a light on it.

**Schrodinger's Cat** is a thought experiment exploring collapses of superposition of states.  Basically, unless alive and dead are two quantum states that are decoupled, and can exist in a superposition, it isn't both alive and dead.  The thought experiment is a analogy for talking about quantum states and how we only see one or the other of solutions, but we have evidence that they are in a superposition of the two solutions at some point in time.

In other words, quantum physics to apply to macro-level object.  The sun's large size ensures that fusion can happen because the quantum tunneling effect allows enough hydrogen to fuse without the necessary energy.  When you use electronics, quantum effects ensure your transistors and stuff work.  It's just that the probability of seeing coherent quantum effects on some large objects is really, really, really, really small."

600	"Hi all

I'm a veteran player and have unlocked quite much in the game - enough to feel satisfied (legendary Armor, legendary weapons, story and ap etc.)

I know that there's still a lot to do and the game offers many things that's both ""grindy"" or ""action related"" but I somehow get the feeling of emptiness. 
I love crafting, exploring, being creative and solve riddles. The more time-consuming the better.
It would therefore be fun to have some kind of actual innovation - which I hoped scribe would offer but instead it got locked to our guildhalls and can't be used outside of that.
Create new items by thinking and being innovative (which I guess isn't possible due to data mine). 
But I do not really like how crafting is used as a way to finish your look in the fashion wars instead of a source to creativity - no wonder why cooking got so unnecessary. 
We got alot of specialisations in guild wars but everything is more or less focused on fighting and being shiny.

Furthermore

What if you or your guild could be able to buy a house for a big amount of gold in your home city, available for everyone to enter and gather random players to have minigames. Just spend your time in some Inn instead of the field, having the best kind of games by actually creating and unlocking  new games. Where scribe and cooking are essential skills to succeed.

Or perhaps being able to fish - you can create the right bait, learn enough to calculate where the biggest fish could spawn, wait enough and catch something spectacular, just by leveling huntsman, cooking and actually think. 

There's so many doors that I would like to see being opened but the focus is a bit to strict.
Hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
Perhaps I'm in a minority of these wishes.

"	"So I've discovered a weird feature of ret pally HP management. It comes from the fact that 1) wake of ashes doesnt have to hit anything to cap HP anymore, 2.) HP decays at a rate of about 1 HP per 10 sec, and 3) the cooldown of wake is 30 seconds.

What this means, is that you can essentially ensure that while you aren't in combat, you can reliably always have 3-5 HP on hand. 

This seems pretty useful for prepping before a boss fight. If you are 30 seconds out from pull, pop wake to give you 5 HP. Then on like the 5 before pull, you can have 3 HP to burn inquisition *as part of your pre-potting.* Then on pull, you are just 2 GCDs away from starting your burn phase (judge + blade + avenging). And, as an added bonus, your wake of ashes will definitely be available again within the burn phase, so you aren't really losing anything to do this.

If you time things well, I think you could do something like this:

(Pre-pot)

* **Wake** + SoV + pre-pot + inq

(Fight begins)

* judge + blade + wings + TV/DS + **Wake** + etc.

And my point about Isaiah 53 wasn't that punishment was only mentioned once, it's that it is never mentioned in a context that suggests a literal interpretation. Psalm 18:31 says that God is a rock. Must I conclude that God is made out of granite? Of course not. Show me a literal context where God is described as rock, and I'll have to accept that he's a rock.

I finally tossed out my (way too expensive) Tom Ford eyeliner pen, because I was afraid I'd get mites or something after 3+ years of use, and now am looking for something that is just as good but not $56. :("	MakeupAddiction	MakeupAddiction	-1

Just a couple thoughts in case they're worth anything. First, way to stay on top of this. Your bill is absolutely too high, something's not right. Do not back off until you get this resolved.

First, this probably goes without saying, make sure your electric supplier is ComEd. There are all kinds of other electric companies that will come to your door and convince you to sign up for their plan. Some are on the up and up, but anyone who advertises to you will jack up the price to ridiculous amounts. You should be paying ~$0.07/kWh or so and your bill should say who your supplier is. Double check this.

If you haven't already, start keeping weekly records of your own electric meter reading. It sounds like you can access it. If this matches up with ComEd's numbers then it's not their fault for billing you what they do. If it's not lining up and it's way off, then it is ComEd's problem. I'm going to assume it's not ComEd, but if you have proof they're somehow not reading your meter right it should be pretty straightforward (fingers crossed) to convince them it's their fault.

Ok, so assuming it's not ComEd, but your meter is actually reading really high rates of usage. In that case something in the building is wired wrong. I won't speculate what, but this would be the responsibility of your landlord to address.

You also said something that made it sound like maybe your meter isn't reading at all and only the building meter was reading? If this is true then your usage is being estimated with all of your neighbors and someone is doing a botched job of it. In this case I would take it up with your landlord and you might also have to get ComEd involved. I was looking for anything specific to ComEd with shared meters and couldn't find anything, but as a tenant you should have your own meter that's metering only your usage. Check out this page for New York's utility's guidelines (https://www.coned.com/en/accounts-billing/how-to-read-your-meter/shared-meters) and I imagine ComEd has sort of similar policies at least.

As a tenant you have pretty good rights in Chicago. Check this out (https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dcd/supp_info/rents_right.html). If your electricity usage is like you say it is you should have a $50 bill this time of year, not $250. Contact your landlord and say you need this dealt with and ask them to have an electrician out to look at the wiring (if this is what it seems like it is). Don't threaten them, but be very firm that this is their responsibility to deal with promptly. Worst case, hire an electrician yourself to come out and look at it and give you their opinion. Get them to give you a quick signed note explaining their findings that you can use to help motivate your landlord to action.

Just a few ideas. Good luck."	Frugal	Frugal	-1

First, let me help you see my perspective here, and feel free to correct it as some info I'm working with, am no expert at. For example, I've always  been a layman physics reader but I also enjoy as much, subjects of philosophy or even ""mysticism""/spirituality (I like pretty much everything tbh) but Im not a scientist nor a scholar on those subjects (I'm an artist). So the main point of all this research I had is if, that which we call consciousness, is indeed a **non\-local** phenomenon. From a cold\-ass scientific perspective, what I understand is it can't be proven nor disproved, and though some prominent father\-figures of quantum physics have ""hinted"" towards non\-locality, I will keep my verdict for this at 50\-50. So the next best way to find out is either die or trust the words of some people with extreme and profound near\-death experiences (NDE). Here is were things become really subjective so I wont analyse further. But nonetheless, my scale tips towards non\-locality. This, meaning that we are connected at some level, ""we are part of the One"", ""we are children of God and God is within us and everything around us"", I can dig that.  Why?  Because this is fractals, yo. God being the the ""Infinite Whole"", ""the One Consciousness"", made up of infinite other ""centres"" which every single one of them can experience the ***whole as its centre***. No?"

632	Let's say a group of the workers freely and consensually start a union. One of the things they negotiate with management is that any new employees hired will join the union. After that term of employment is made publicly known to any potential employees, those potential employees are free to ponder if they would join such a company or decline and work elsewhere. Any employee who has chosen to work at this company has thus consensually chosen to join the union. They may have begrudgingly joined because other pros outweigh the cons of joining a union to them, but they evaluated the whole package and made a free choice. An employee has a right to choose where they work, but this doesn't necessarily give them the power to chose ala cart the conditions of where they work. To use the government to enforce such ala cart choice (right to work) serves to nullify an existing agreement between two parties in favor of a future hypothetical 3rd party. This infringes on both initial parties exercise of self determination.	"To galvanize what Sudo_Brew stated, there is no guarantee that every person we put to death deserves it.

635	"Since it looks like u/dk4soc is gone, here's a take on Venezuela written by someone from the same political camp. Their crowd respects some of the honest attempts at improving the lives of Venezuelans that Chavez pursued, but they are also critical of how Chavez attempted to implement socialism from above using state power: [http://socialistworker.org/2017/06/07/did-socialism-fail-in-venezuela](http://socialistworker.org/2017/06/07/did-socialism-fail-in-venezuela)

The author points out how revolutionary socialists are fighting for ""socialism from below"" as opposed to ""socialism from above."" The difference is that ""socialism from above"" is a kind of society imposed by leaders with state power while ""socialism from below"" is a kind of society that decides how to run itself through mass democratic engagement. It only works if everyone in the society is able to participate in self-governance. The revolutionary socialists assert that Chavez used state power to generate socialism from above. He wanted to transform that into a kind of socialism from below, but ultimately failed due to oil companies orchestrating what they called ""strikes"" but were more realistically employer lock-outs in order to sabotage they Venezuelan economy and reinstate capitalist power.

**From the article:**

""BASED ON this understanding of socialism, it is impossible to identify Venezuela under Chávez as anything but a version of socialism from above. The origin of ""socialism of the 21st century"" in a speech by the president, with its first concrete steps handing more power to that president, is the very definition of ""from above.""

Defenders of the Bolivarian revolution acknowledge, of course, the reality that the first steps have been taken by friendly managers of the state--but they go on to insist that these steps have been crucial to the development of grassroots projects from below advancing the level of democratic engagement. In a recent interview for the print edition of *Jacobin* magazine, Gregory Wilpert states:

&gt;The fact is, historically, the government is oftentimes the main obstacle to revolution, right? But in Venezuela, suddenly you had a different kind of government, one that said: ""Hey, you can create these communes, you can organize yourselves, and so on."" Isn't that the government giving the tools to the people to participate in that revolution? To make their own revolution, in fact?

Under this conception, Venezuela's network of communal councils should develop under the sponsorship of the state, but also in opposition to it, as a revolutionary movement from below--one that would need to challenge the state at any point that it becomes an obstacle to the development of communal power.

This is a contradiction, to say the least, which can be seen in the very clear limitations on popular power in Venezula--especially when it comes to workers' power over their workplaces.

The actual experience of [the relationship between the government and working-class organization has been mixed](http://socialistworker.org/2007-2/641/641_06_Chavez.shtml), with the state picking and choosing which initiatives for workers' control it supported and which it didn't.

For example, even at the high point of Chavismo a decade ago, the government rejected nationalization as an option for Sanitarios Maracay, a bathroom fixture manufacturer run under workers' control after the employer abandoned negotiations. When the employer succeeded in ousting the workers' occupation, the government refused to intervene--because the factory wasn't ""strategic.""

And it must be remembered that even state-run enterprises, much less those under some real form of workers' control, have always been a minority in the Venezuelan economy. [As Anderson Bean wrote in a recent SocialistWorker.org article](http://socialistworker.org/2017/05/17/venezuela-at-an-impasse):

&gt;Despite its progressive language on participatory democracy and human rights, the 1999 Chavista constitution gives significant protection to private property in Article 15.  
In fact, between 1999 and 2011, the private sector's share of economic activity actually increased from 65 to 71 percent. The critical oil sector is dominated by a state-owned company, but other important industries, like food imports and processing operations, pharmaceuticals and auto parts, are still controlled by the private sector.

The limitations on anything that could be called ""popular power"" are even more obvious today with [the increasing authoritarianism of the Maduro government](http://socialistworker.org/2017/05/03/against-venezuelas-authoritarian-turn).

But even under Chávez, economic and political power in Venezuela remained overwhelmingly in the hands of a corrupt capitalist elite and an increasingly bureaucratized state that was in a position to control the amount of popular power it was supposedly encouraging.

Attempts at grassroots organizing through the communal network, though often very inspiring, remained subordinated to the bureaucracy. And meanwhile, the government, by simultaneously upholding and protecting privately owned industry, weakened its own position in conflicts with Venezuela's capitalists, particularly as the drop in oil prices hit Venezuela's oil export-based economy.""

**In the end, though, it is important to remember that the Venezuelan economy is especially a shit show because of the Venezuelan oil industry sabotaging it in an effort to topple Chavez.**"	"&gt; Generally, I think our immigration laws are pretty on point.

Short wave means fast. Long wave means slow. And the object is within the position of the whole wave. 

Now they can give a short wave which means the object is very fast, and because it is short the location is precise.

But the slower objects they try to explain, the longer and longer waves they must use. But those waves do not give the position. And  a thing that is still would be infinitely long wave, so it could be anywhere.

Reality is a bit like that. Things cannot be still and have a precise position.

"You don't seem to understand my post. Conquest was the best received Fates game by long time fans. It's the best game to come out of Intelligent Systems in a decade but that doesn't mean much on the back end. If Birthright sold more, which it did, and sold more DLC, which it likely did, that's likely the direction they'll take the series. I'm not going to believe the company who pumped Awakening full of horrible DLC, fixed that DLC somewhat in Fates, and then went went an even worse DLC model in Echoes and is currently riding gachapon revenue is going to make decisions for the gameplay above the profits. That's not how current IS operates. We don't have someone like Kaga telling his team to remake FE4 again late into development to make it perfect. Fire Emblem went into cost savings mode with Shadow Dragon and even though they're out of the hole they're still working with the money first mindset. I'm pretty sure Higuchi only got his FE2 remake because he was able to shove a season pass into it. 

They've also said they're not doing a FE4 remake next. Higuchi wants to make an FE6 remake next which is the most practical decision considering how much the West craves Elibe content and how Roy is a household name thanks to Smash. I'd be okay with this since I doubt I'd be happy with how they would handle FE4 and FE5. As a long time fan myself (started with FE7 on release, played every game related to the series except Berwick Saga), I see no reason to be excited for the future of the series. I have many reasons to be cautiously optimistic, but I'm not going to pretend like Conquest wasn't a fluke. We got ONE good Fire Emblem game out of the past five, and that good one was bundled with a mediocre casual pleaser and one of the worst FE games ever released. There also isn't much of a reason to be excited for how Echoes was presented given that Maeda and the main team has been working on FE Switch for a few years and had nothing to do with Echoes which was developed by a smaller separate team.

It's a logical notion, and all of science relies on the assumption that it is true, but it can't be tested scientifically.

I don't consider Intelligent Design to be science. I consider it to be a theological/philosophical reaction to scientific discoveries.

Are you not able to see it?


&gt;Let me ask you this, Do you believe there is currently a war of soft censorship on non-mainstream media right now? Being in the tech world, i can show you how these things work.

This is not even partially related to this discussion. We are talking about THIS particular bill in congress and what it does. It does not do what you said, it is a legal bill full of legal jargon. It has nothing near what all that SOPA PIPA or others garbage had in it which was vague and unclear. This one is very clear and very specific with a target goal in-mind. This argument is irrelevant to this discussion and it is not even sponsored by all the same congressmen. This is one of the good bills and knee jerk reactions are not helpful here. I can't remember the saying, but it goes something like after fighting for a while or being paranoid for some time, eventually everything is perceived as an enemy or a threat. This is a dangerous way to view the world and the internet will not be censored due to this bill. We aren't trying to protect criminals with our ""freedom of speech"" I would hope. I only care to protect shitposting on Reddit and other similar things.

651	"I know this is really super unhelpful but I've been to all four of those cities you've suggested and all of them are great ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Personally I would pick Lisbon - it's probably one of my favourite cities. It's very chilled and laidback, absolutely excellent for just wandering around in (really great, artsy streets/buildings and plenty of cool little shops to shop around in), and you can get some really great hole in the wall food for very cheap. Bairro Alto is also great for going out in at night if you're into the chill bar scene - the entire district is essentially an open bar where people wander from bar to bar and sit down on the curb/hang around in the street etc, really great vibes. 

Sintra is just a day trip from Lisbon and while it's nice to see it's also *very* touristy so keep that in mind.

Séville is a great city to do nothing in - if you're just looking to sit down and read a book while drinking the best orange juice ever, this is the kind of place to do it. I spent a lot of time in Seville just kind of wandering around and watching flamenco dancers busk. It's probably on par with Lisbon for being the most beautiful city IMO. From memory there's not much of a nightlife here, although there is one ""secret"" bar that is neat to check out.

Ljubljana is also very cute and picturesque and makes for good wandering (although it's somewhat small so you might run out of things to do)  - I'd make sure to head to Lake Bled as well, that is definitely worth the trip and is really gorgeous. Google metelkova - its similar to Christiana in Copenhagen and is a great alt scene to go out in. 

Copenhagen is also pretty and makes for good wandering in a different way - it's more modern and has less of that cute European feel to it but it's an awesome city in its own regard. Lots of great small bars, there's Christiana of course, and there's Tivoli in the centre of the city (which you have to pay to get into but it's pretty neat to see all the stands and stuff inside, it's like a mini theme park/fête type deal). Tbh this is probably the most different from Budapest and Berlin though, with Barcelona being a close second to that. 

Have you considered the Baltics? Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius are really fantastic - Riga has a great low-key alt night scene (look up the bar Chomsky) and if you're into urban exploration/doing something different you can see if you can make your way to Skrunda-1 (basically Pripyat but without the radiation - very cool) in Latvia and Rummu (abandoned quarry/prison - like an hour from Tallinn) in Estonia. In Lithuania you can head to the curonian spit which is pretty great to bike around and do a mini hike on - it's got some really stunning unique landscapes. "	"Research is always hardest for me if going to places which don't deliver tourist information in English (web browsers do a decent job translating but it's slower and the meaning still confusing).  
  
Transport to towns or small cities especially when run by multiple regional networks that each have their own websites, way of presenting information, etc  
  
Public buses within large cities (sometimes the routes are so confusing and bus stop locations unclear that I avoid alogether).

657	"Well it's gone a bit far now, especially since your oldest is an adult. She can accept anything she wants without much input from you. You should have talked to your sister about this behavior years ago. There is of course favoritism going on here, but you know what? That's life. It's not fair and your sister is setting a good example of why that's not the case. She probably had the means to treat them a like that, but for some reason shares a special bond with your oldest daughter which causes this kind of behavior.

Not everyone gets a good break like this and while I would assume your oldest daughter is treated well by your sister, I'd imagine your other children are probably pretty well taken care of. If it's been going on for years, then it's also possibly your other children don't think about it. This very well may be the norm for them. While they probably don't necessarily think it's fair, there's really not a whole lot that can be done about it. You can talk to your sister, but it's her money and now that your daughter is an adult, she can choose to accept extravagant gifts or not without any extra input.

Talk to your sister, she is the only one that can actually do anything about this one-sided deal, but if she feels like she shares a special bond with your oldest that's not there with the other children and this is how she shows affection, than that's just how it's going to be. It's not exactly fair to your other children, but you're thinking about it from a parents' perspective, which you're supposed to do. But take that hat off and put on the ""fun loving aunt"" hat and things may look differently. They aren't her children, they are family but she doesn't have an obligation to love them all equally like a good parent does. I mean shit, it would be nice if she were doing that, but that kind of thing cannot be compelled. You should have addressed this behavior like 13 years ago, now you're on the very wrong side of this problem. You said it yourself, it's always been like this. Your warning lights should have been flashing at the point of the trips she got to take that the other kids didn't. Instead, the warning bells are just going off now with the car that I'd never be able to afford unless I sold a kidney? C'mon, you have to me more aware than this.

Trying to step in now may just further align them together, since you let it go on this is a ""normal"" dynamic of their relationship and frankly, you have no business interfering at this point with the relationship of two adults. It's definitely unfair to your other kids, but that's life, we all don't get the same advantages and if you were to do something about this, it's far beyond that point. It's not your daughter's problem to manage, because it's not a problem for her at all. 

Best I can say is talk to your sister about her clear favoritism, do it gently unless you want to stir up a bunch of family drama and just fully expect your sister to shut you down by saying that they have a close relationship and that you never really voiced any concerns about this in the past. You had opportunities to step in and shut this down when you were in charge of your daughter. You're not now, so the best you can do is offer up a bit of advice or just bring your concerns gently with your sister. "	"OK, so I think your boyfriend probably just wants you to be happy and stable. As someone who's dated a guy who was going through similar issues (hated current job, was demoralized looking for a new one, didn't know what he wanted to do), it was really tough being supportive. I tried listening and being comforting, being supportive, helping look for a new job, suggesting exactly what your boyfriend has (that I train him in some skills I have)...but there's only so long you can watch or try helping someone who isn't helping themselves.

Look, I think your boyfriend is trying his best to be supportive and probably is just frustrated with not knowing how to best help you. And I know it's really hard to hate what you do and feel demoralized. But you need to spend some time - ignoring your boyfriend's opinions - and figure out what you want to pursue. Or you'll be sitting in a miserable cycle of self loathing forever. This is YOUR life. It's not too late to try something new. If you want to write, figure out a way to make enough money to support yourself while pursuing that. If that means doing some mindless job you don't care about (but don't hate), do that and pursue writing. "	relationships	relationships	-1
658	I sometimes wonder why women are so easily angered and offended compared to men. For example, last day i was riding bicycles with my brother, we were doing fairly calm pace of 15km/h and we traveled total of 20 kilometers, its not much. We had fun the entire trip and little difficulties like getting caught by the rain/storm mid way and getting a little tired was refreshing and didint affect us negatively but just added to our little adventure. We can take any route we want, get tired, get wet, get sun scorched, fall down, bust a knee and still get fun together and there is no reason for any tension. But whenever i ride bikes with my girlfriend or do anything with her i always feel her pressure and expectations and her generaly not wanting to do anything that would even midly inconvince her or make her put effort into activity like ridding a little faster or taking the route she doesnt like. I mean its all trivial but she makes it such a big thing and she provekes fights about what route do we take or the weather we ride in. Whenever something is not exactly how she invisions it she gets mad at me and expect me to fix it or adapt myself to her expectations.

I have acid in my freezer from last year, I dunno if it's still good but wanna try it?"" I said sure because I'd never tried LSD and was curious and had nothing else to do. We tried it, after an hour figured it was no good and then WHAM-O! It definitely worked! We went for a walk and I called another friend who was a frequent tripper. He immediately dropped and set off to meet us. We met up, feeling awesome and walked over to Kensington to chill and smoke some herb at this lounge. We sat out back on the patio when a guy came by and dropped us some samples of bud (not uncommon there) but gave us more than an eight between the three of us (SCORE!). Then one of the baristas comes up to us and says ""Hey, there's this crazy guy from the Netherlands inside demoing a vaporizer he invented but he's leaving soon, you should check it out!"" So we're like ""Hell yeah!"" And go inside and check out [The Verdamper](https://www.vaposhop.com/vaporizers/home-vaporizers/verdamper/) which is an amazing vapo/bong combo thing. We chatted with him for almost 2 hours before he had to leave or he was going to miss his flight. He kept talking and talking (mostly in Dutch) and was such a nice and friendly guy. When we tried to use our bud that the guy had given us before (which was quite nice stuff) he scoffed and pulled out a selection of top notch strains for us to choose from.

Anyway, the article says that if the brain hears a voice that it doesn't recognise as its own, the ""logical"" step for the brain is to conclude that it's someone else's voice, and the next ""logical"" step is to come up with a theory for how it's possible to hear what it's hearing. Since the brain ""knows"" that there's a stranger's voice, all the following conclusions will be subordinate to that ""fact"". 

Completely sane people come up with completely false theories based on just a fistful of data all the time. It's what the brain is built for, making a plausible model of the world based on the things it knows. It doesn't sound surprising to me that something like that could happen with such weird effects if a brain is wired wrong to begin with. Other posters here have talked about combating this phenomenon in themselves with information and reasoning, so, at least for this aspect of schizophrenia, it seems to me that a good understanding of how the brain works *and acceptance of the fact that everyone is at their brain's mercy*, i.e. the ego is not in control, might be a path to reasoning against the legitimacy of such voices."	todayilearned	todayilearned	-1

670	"&gt;Where is the modal fallacy in the statement that it is not possible that any other action could be taken if God knows what actions occur? 

That wasn't the original statement made. You said,

&gt;&gt;if god knows your actions then it is necessary that you will execute those actions, but if it is necessary that you will execute those actions then it is not possible that you could not execute those actions, therefore the actions are **predetermined** since it is **necessary they occur**

This is a modal fallacy.

However, the revised argument doesn't work either. It requires the logical necessity, otherwise the inclusion of God's foreknowledge as a premise is meaningless.

I can pare down your argument to simply be,

1. It is only possible to choose what one chooses.

2. A person chooses A.

3. Therefore only the choice A can possibly follow.

This is always true, regardless of whether God exists, knows the future and regardless of whether we consider it under any form of determinism, free will, or compatibilism. Noting I use ""choice"" loosely here.

What is *possible* is limited by ""choice"" itself. So there is no meaningful way to demonstrate the difference between this and foreknowledge when only considering what's ""possibly true"".

So adding a premise dealing with God's perfect foreknowledge is now irrelevant to the argument. It is only meaningful if it serves to establish the logical necessity of an outcome. Such that 2 would be restricted *logically* and *necessarily* to A, instead of 1 restricting the only *possibility* to A.

She mentioned she hadn't had a serious relationship in awhile so I figured she just let a few bad habits get the best of her. Saying she would work on those issues gave me hope, just not sure if I am expecting too much of her.

Merely attaching a cheap as dirt $1 million heat shield + parachute to a lump of 10 tonnes of space-refined copper would increase the kilo price by $100. 

Copper in the world market is currently at 5$ per kg. People forget how cheap our resources are and how any extra work in space quickly increases the prices by orders of magnitude. Even if completely free and 99.9% pure nickel-iron ingots were orbiting the earth at a 1000 km LEO, it would absolutely not be worth bringing them back until space travel can safely de-orbit materials at well below  $1 per kg. Any imaginable thruster system will use more for orbital maneuvering fuel alone. SpaceX could make access to and from space 1/100th the current cost and it would still be too expensive to bring down bulk copper or nickel.

Another issue with the re-patriation of space metals is that a 10 tonne lump of chromium in orbit and attached to a de-orbiting thruster pack is an inherent weapon.

You either have not looked or are willfully misrepresenting the facts. A single google search results in multiple sources with direct quotes from the victims regarding the extent of his sexual abuse.

&gt; ""Most of the alleged abuse happened with these girls parents in the room. How much of this was legitimate medical treatment and how much was done for his sexual arrousal?""


Firstly, he pleaded guilty, that should be enough to tell you it was for sexual arousal and not medically appropriate. But, as someone who works in the healthcare profession, I can assure you his actions were not medically appropriate. [Unwarned, unconsented, and ungloved](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-mize-pelvic-therapy_us_5a67f62ae4b0e5630074aa9b) pelvic exams are a disgusting betrayal of medical trust.

&gt; ""You are everything that is wrong with society.""


I would argue your inability to properly research and form positions based on factualities is a better representation of a societal problem. We'll see if you have the bravery to practice what you preach and concede your position now that you have been presented with evidence.

I have also announced the formation of the club to all my classes. I went in with a heavy chest and fast breathing expecting backlash, however this wasn't the case. Many people nodded heads and clapped and there were few glares and outrage. I am so happy that people were listening. 

I know this is not the case for many people and groups involving men's rights, so I will use people's openness as an opportunity and not waste it.

706	The infrastructure in the south is generally not able to handle winter weather storms so I feel for you guys there. However, if you are able to salt at least before and after the storm (or rain) has come to a stop it should help quite a bit regardless if some of the salt gets washed away during the storm. Salt works by dissolving into the water which lowers the freezing point of this now salty water in comparison to pure water. So if the salt is melting the snow, some of the salt has already dissolved into the water and therefore even if some salt gets washed away that left over water has a lower freezing point than it once did before any salt. Given, you are correct that if it continues raining for a while it will obviously decrease the amount of salt in the remaining water but that is why you must salt before and after the storm (even once during if you notice it's slippery).

It's hard to know what to say to your question without seeing them.

Maybe the only real way to answer your question sufficiently well is with hundreds of lines of code. Who knows. Or maybe you're right and you just stumbled on rude people.

##### My simple and incomprehensive rapid guide to API engineering
___

I honestly believe it’s difficult to fully quantify a series of steps to becoming an engineer. It’s comparable to having an artistic style in writing or music composition.

What I will say is there’s resources that can help jump start your journey through the wonderful world of development.

By no means is this comprehensive or static, if you start down this path and come across a path of your own take it.

###### Starting Advice

-    Remain Confident, you got this. Don’t let anyone discourage you or say you can’t do it. Part of my biggest problem going into development in the corporate world was management telling me I didn’t know what I was doing until my coworkers told me I knew more than I thought I knew or management would give me credit for.

-    Your application doesn’t need to be incredible or disruptive, you’ll soon find even some of the simplest solutions you craft still require decent structure and technique.

-    Remember, this is the mastery of Input/Output. Upon input (if there’s an input), your function should perform an operation and return an output (if there’s an output)

-    Keep it functional. . . Your functions and methods should accomplish one task. It makes testing your code easier since you can test individual operations one by one instead of one giant function each time. What a task is, is up to your discretion. Ex: *convert a string to uppercase*, *update a database record*, *validate user input*

###### Incomprehensive Guide

-    Read K&amp;R (for learning language constructs, implement code blocks you don’t understand and step through the debugger as you do; but don’t spend too much time here just yet. SKIM)

-    A Tour of Go (structured and opinionated language, forces you to adhere to decent standards of development in order to compile)

-    Learn what RESTful APIs are and the four major HTTP verbs.

-    Use the Gin framework with Golang to create a RESTful API that simply returns “Hello, World”.

-    Use the Gin framework to accept some user input and store it in a variable, then recall the same variable.

-    Use the Gin framework to accept and validate user input and store it in a database, recall that data somehow.

-    Take a look at a major open-source Golang project and compare your style to others and learn why their approach or your approach is better suited for your project.

-    Challenge yourself and explore at your pace, not when management says you can. They’re more likely to look out for their own rears as well as the company’s before you."	apple	apple	-1

What you are doing is helping students cheat.  No other way to say it, sorry!

Many colleges require students to sign an “honor pledge” or similar that says something like “I certify that this work is my own” - if students handed in one of the papers you wrote they would be violating this pledge and risk expulsion.

I’ve been a TA at major universities and I would never tolerate them using your service.

You help engineering students by doing their homework for them?  That’s a threat to public safety and you could be criminally liable if one of those engineers put out a design that hurt or killed people if you could be shown to have helped them cheat through a related homework assignment.

Russia has repeatedly infringed on the sovereignty of the Baltic States and has handed out passports to Russian-speaking residents. You should ask the residents of those countries how safe they feel.

It doesn't matter if territories are geopolitically important or not. Legally that makes no difference. Russia has repeatedly failed to respect the sovereignty of surrounding states and Trump is absolutely fine with this.

What is also interesting is that I never hear Trump/Russia apologists apply the same logic in cases where Russia doesn't stand to benefit. They claim that Crimea is historically Russian, and should be part of Russia. It was a drunk Secretary-General who did it blah blah. 

Historically Karelia is Finnish. When Finland was part of Russia, it was part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. It was only annexed by Russia relatively recently (75 years ago) and after an unprovoked attack by Stalin. Should Russia cede this to Finland? 

And if it is the language of the people who live there that matters and Russia is the state for all Russian-speaking people then what about all of the minorities in Russia? Do they deserve their own state? Should the Netherlands start handing out Dutch passports to Flemish people, arming Flemish militias and start threatening the Belgian federal government not to intervene in Flanders?"

This would result in the service essentially paying you with your own money. That doesn't make any sense. You need a liquidity provider willing to commit _their own funds_ to new channel.

&gt;The negative fees method is where you yourself begin using your channels to route payments for other people; and if one of your channels has no more incoming capacity, well, that means it has high outgoing capacity, so what you can do is offer to pay people a few satoshis to route their payments through your node in the outgoing direction. That way, as payments go outward through you, you'll send coins to the other side of your channel, which gives you incoming capacity.

Only kind of.  The Nazis held 37% seats in the Reichstag after the 1932 Presidential election which Hitler *lost* to Hindenburg (admittedly, with 37% of Germans voting for Hitler).  But in early 1933 Hindenburg caved and made Hitler Chancellor.  Hitler then convinced Hindenburg to rule by decree after calling a new election.  In that 1933 election the Nazis took 44% of Reichstag seats and, along with other, smaller right wing parties, was able to form a Government.  Once the Nazis had a majority voting bloc, they changed the laws to give Hitler power. The last attempt to get rid of those powers was snuffed out by Nazi brownshirts storming a meeting and Hitler's power was consolidated.

So Hitler never won an election personally, though after the (Nazi prompted) burning of the Reichstag building Germans did give the Nazis and their right-wing allies enough power to take over."	Libertarian	Libertarian	-1

The US is a union of individual States with different demographics. Comparing say, Norway, (pop 5M) to, say,  Missouri (pop 6M) isn’t even accurate: Norway is a monoculture and effectively one ethnic group. Missourians are very different and are not a monoculture nor consider themselves a single ethnicity. This affects the outcome of how governments act. Further, the costs of living in many of these “successful” single payer systems are much higher, with lower quality of care compared to care available in the United States. The US has more than twice the number of MRI machines per 100,000 than Canada. And if single payer doesn’t preclude private care and insurance, then it ultimately admits that the care offered by the system is inferior to that offered privately.

Further, Sweden as an example shows that single payer fails markets when it misallocates resources because central planning cannot anticipate where resources are needed. Canada has to send cancer patients to the US for treatment after lengthy bureaucratic processes. In all systems where something is “free” there is overconsumption, evidenced in all of these systems.

And you still haven’t disproven how private plastic surgery has managed to become a lucrative industry available to the middle class. You’ve only stated you can’t see the forest through the trees. But it is, because their services are often not covered by insurance (imagine that) and lucrative markets draw labor. Nobody disputes that healthcare in the United States is absurdly expensive, but the problem isn’t lack of government or regulation: quite the opposite. Medicare and Medicaid price fix, leaving a lot of costs just to break even for hospitals and doctors to be paid by private parties. Insurers have become bargaining groups, cutting deals with providers for better rates. Because the government drove costs up, insurers instituted co-pay. And much of the cost is in paying people to file paperwork. Healthcare providers have inflated costs so the whittled down “deal” is closer to the actual expense. The market didn’t fail in health care, government is the problem. Single payer won’t fix it, because it’ll just cause exploding costs (so will “free” college a la Federal student loans).

It's not complicated. If you have any questions about it, commit to being faithful about something. Like cleaning your room. Or telling your mother you love her.

Matthew 15:21-28 New King James Version (NKJV): A Gentile Shows Her Faith

21 Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”
23 But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.”
24 But He answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
25 Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
26 But He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”
27 And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
28 Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

Orthodoxy Study Bibles explanation: 
“15:22 This woman shows immeasurable love—she so identifies with the sufferings of her daughter that she cries “Have mercy on me,” for she sees her daughter’s well-being as her own and her daughter’s sufferings as her own.”
“15:23 Christ refuses to answer, not only because she is a Gentile and His ministry before His passion is first to the Jews, but also to reveal this woman’s profound faith and love. Several of the Fathers see the disciple’s request to send her away as an attempt to persuade Jesus to heal the daughter, as if to say, “Give her what she wants so that she will leave.” Christ’s response indicates this interpretation is correct, for He again refuses to heal the daughter.”
“15:26-28 Having evoked this woman’s love and persistent faith, Christ now reveals her humility. She accepts her place beneath the Jews, who were the chosen people of God, yet still desires a share in God’s grace. Christ’s hesitancy was not a lack of compassion, but a conscious means of revealing the virtues of this woman, both to the disciples and for her own sake. Her ultimate acceptance by Christ also points to the gathering of the Gentiles into the Church after Pentecost, no longer as dogs, but as children who are invited to eat the bread of eternal life.”

My code is interesting for the same reasons that the OP's code was interesting: making random number generators that are suitable for secure applications is hard, and if you have a random number generator whose only problem is that its biased towards one result but is otherwise perfectly random, then my code or the OP's code shows how you can get an unbiased random number generator out of that.

Apologies for thinking Nintendo should be held to a higher standard.

Look at the Switch- no cloud saves. If your system fails, you lose your saves. Unique to the Switch. Other consoles do not have this issue, most definitely not PCs. But it's Nintendo, so they've gotten away with it. Their online infrastructure doesn't exist almost a year into the console's lifespan, but it's Nintendo, so they've gotten away with it. They have a built-in rewards system, which you can't use on the Switch almost a year into its lifespan because they haven't bothered to make any Switch-related rewards, and they're getting away with it. All points people got on launch? They're going to expire before you can even use them, and Nintendo's going to get away with it.

Science explains why these natural phenomena occur.

Herein lies the difficulty in pinpointing where God really is.  If lightning is a natural function of electricity and God did not cause it to strike that person dead, could God have still been acting to put in motion the events that led up to that particular release of electrical charge?

When science explains why something happens, religion simply backs up one step and puts God as the agent behind the natural phenomenon.

It reminds me of the ""I know you are but what am I?"" retort you often hear on school playgrounds.  No matter what the person is called, there is always a way out.


Likewise, no matter what science explains, religion always tries to one up it by putting God behind the explanation.

Will it surrender and go quietly into that dark night?  Or will it back up a step and credit God for putting into motion the events that led to evolution?

912	"I think we're both basically agreeing with what was said in the linked video .. :)

However, I was responding mostly to this from your earlier comment:

&gt; But it can't do any more processing.

Which is inaccurate and symptomatic of the issue being talked about in the video. It *can* do more processing, as in it is not saturated by execution of instructions in the core hardware we generally mean by ""CPU"", but stalled (perhaps unnecessarily) by things like memory access. It is actually sitting idle, not executing instructions, when it could be (as in the case in the video). So it could be executing more, it could be doing more processing, there is more that CPU could be doing, but the software is getting in its way. It is an important distinction.

&gt; I don't see what this has to do with the CPU utilization metric somehow not 
&gt; being accurate for what it's meant to be.

There are two issues imo. One is the nomenclature issue which you mentioned, though I don't think it makes sense to rename CPU utilization (which we probably agree on) but to simply educate people writing software as to what it actually means (or perhaps, what it doesn't) and this video is a decent start to that.

The other is that in simpler times when CPU's were rather more straight-forward than they are today, ""CPU utilization"" did indeed mean exactly what it sounds like it means, and so received wisdom passed down over the years is that if you see high CPU utilization start profiling your code as if it were actually bound by the execution timing of the instructions your code compiles to.

The various caches, hardware threading capabilities, etc have changed all that, obviously, but many (most?) developers haven't adjusted to this. I recall a really interesting presentation some years by developers from .. Yahoo? .. on the PHP interpreter and how they sped it up significantly by focusing on parts of the code that were responsible for tiny amount of execution time but which were blowing the caches on nearly every call. They had been focused on CPU instruction performance, but the bigger issues were related to CPU cache invalidation.

For me, that CPU utilization metric is a placeholder of this general category of issue, where we (or at least most of us) are taught as developers to mainly pay attention to CPU vs IO (disk vs network vs ..) issues with the rest of it being either not really paid attention to or seen as dark magic for wizards to care about. 

So personally when I saw this video, I didn't see it as a critique of the CPU utilization metric but as a call to action to get us all thinking about things like blowing caches and TLBs, hardware thread stalling, ... but maybe that was just me :)"	This looks insane to maintain.

913	"Usually some sort of phosphor compound is used to convert nonvisible to visible for fluorescent lights. They fluoresce or react with the UV light. 

Basically they take in the UV light, then they're in an excited state, then they release light at a lower frequency (UV -&gt; Visible) and go back to a low energy state."	"In essence it all comes down to how a particular wavelength of light (a laser produces just one specific wavelength) interacts with a certain material.

You know how you can sit inside a sunny car all day and not get a sunburn?  That's because the wavelength of light that interacts with your skin to give you a sunburn interacts so well with glass that it's mostly all absorbed.  Or X-rays can go straight through a sheet of glass but can't go through a sheet of lead.

So to make a laser that does you want, you find a specific wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible light, UV light, IR, X-rays, Gamma Rays, etc) that reacts with the material you want, to do what you want.  (or in more practical terms, you see if any of the available wavelengths of laser available will work since you can't just order any specific wavelength of laser you want).

So for printers they found a laser that would melt the plastic toner pellets and fuse them to the paper.  (750nm)

For rust removal it's a wavelength that will heat up and evaporate rust but mostly reflects off the shiny metal underneath.

Tattoo removal uses one that breaks up the ink particles but mostly doesn't interact with skin.

TL;DR: It's not that **a** laser can do so many things, it's that there are tons of different kinds of laser that do different things to different things. 

Bonus content: There is also the fact that the laser energy can be stored or ""charged up"" and released in pulses up to millions of times per second and that will change how the beam interacts as well.  You can have a continuous low level of energy up to extremely short (femtosecond 1/1,000,000,000,000,000th of a second) but high energy pulses."	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	-1

918	"*Hieroglyphs recorded consonants (+ ideographs, so you have symbols for concepts--like an ankh--mixed in with the consonants), people sub in the vowels with what feels most right. It definitely isn't an exact science, but it's close since there's only so many ways to pronounce consonants. You can base your pronunciations on descendant languages, like Coptic--which was used to help decipher Hieroglyphs in the first place if my memory serves me well. My field is medieval Northern Europe, so I work a lot with Old Norse and Latin. With both of those we look at what was passed down through written or oral traditions. There are actually several grammatical treatises written by Classical Latin authors, so we have a pretty accurate idea what Classical Latin sounded like--in the middle ages this could become a bit butchered, so there are distinctions between Ecclesiastical Latin and that used by Ancient Romans. Old Norse survives pretty faithfully in modern Icelandic. There are no questions about whether Þórr is the word the vikings used for their thunder god, or how to properly pronounce it. I'd be surprised if Egyptologists didn't get /some/ idea of the pronunciation of Ancient Egyptian from Coptic, based on my experience.

In the case of Egypt we have a lot of names the Greeks used, instead of the original Egyptian names. The Greek Ptolemy dynasty ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great conquered it. The god Thoth for example is named 'ḏḥwty' (pronounced probably along the lines of 'Djehuty' with vowels) in the actual Egyptian. The English we're speaking in right now is a mix of Germanic English and Norman French--which is a Romance language, meaning it is derived from Latin unlike Old English. The Romans took over Egypt (you definitely know the story), and the Romans used the Greek names as they used many Greek things. Language is fluid and the names for places/things change over time, but you can definitely trace the roots.

*disclaimer: My field isn't Egyptology (I'd like to think I could maybe be a hobby Egyptologist :) I've loved researching this stuff since I was a kid, and I minored in it during my undergrad) so a proper one could definitely fill in the details better, but here's my shot at answering your questions based on my experience in a related field."

Because we're not able to talk about different shades of issues, people get labelled as ""extremists"" and then just succumb to it.

I think most people are probably like me in that they don't really care about Islam, but are happy to have Muslims in Canada despite some regressive characteristics that are part of any religion. Still, we all think that as long as it's not too bad, we can live with it. 

But let's say you want to speak out against face coverings because it perpetuates the notion that women are chattel or that they lack agency over their own sexuality; there are enough people out there of influence who label that ""extremist"" and then what?

You either shut up or take it as a challenge. 

It's like the ""Proud Redneck"" thing in the US South or conservative evangelicals becoming the absolute worst thing we say they are. At some point it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you can't have objective, moderated views that aren't black and white then you force people into one extreme or the other. And I think extremists count on that for force multiplication.

Take right-wing Nazis in the US. There probably are just a few thousand in the country, but they have an outsized voice because there are a lot of conservatives who have overlap with *some* of their views and it's better to caucus with them than with ""liberals"". 

Radicalisation and polarisation doesn't happen overnight and if you're a moderate, I think you need to assert that you can believe Islam has some features that are incompatible with a modern, secular Canada and not be shamed for it. And I think it goes without saying that it isn't just Islam, either. The Catholics ran Quebec like a theocracy for 300 years. That's the stuff we don't want to happen again. "	canada	canada	-1

This is like saying the computer you are using to post is diverting resources that could be used for other purposes. 

I don't see why we have to downsize *the entire population* in order to serve the poor. And while I agree in principle to the idea that we could create a dorm-like atmosphere for housing the poor, I wonder how well that would work in practice.

I'm all for experimentation and loosening current zoning requirements, which I think are a bit bat-shit crazy.

 They are AWFUL with money and I can spend it better on more of the things they want or better things....like my kiddo was able to have double the amount of these little squishy toys since I took control of the money, so she got 4 different ones that were name brand instead of the one she could have gotten at the store with her money. She spent $11 on a journel recently at a book fair that had a lock and key and the key was missing when we got home- found it on Amazon for $7. Just examples.

 Also...I was a single mom for a long time (By death) and sometimes gifts were just not in the equation and I needed gas money to get to the $780/mo daycare for her when she was young...raising kids is thankless a lot of times.

However, I think in this day and age, the resources and knowledge are simply too freely available: such that someone would have to go above and beyond irresponsibility to lose this kind of money. Yes, you guessed it, the internet is a huge part of that. 

In other words, i'm saying that just a few simple steps can ensure adequate management of the kind of wealth Coentrao has. 

Particularly now where the wealthy have seemingly been placed across a farther and farther gap relative to the poor and middle class. I.e. the age of the 1%; the have's and have nots. Just liquidating the kinds of property Coentrao owns already can likely ensure he never even enters middle class- let alone having to be ""poor"".

Let's say I've started a company and I hire Bob as my first employee. If the economy were a zero sum game then that's it. Economy is over, no more growth, everyone go home. But since it's not, hiring Bob allows me to hire more people. After a month of having Bob help my around I've noticed that my profits are through the roof compared to when I was working alone. With this extra money I could afford to hire Alice and by next month's end my profits will be even higher and I can hire more people repeat ad infinitum until the effects of [diminishing marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) are felt.

But growth creating growth doesn't end there. Alice used to be a full time mom but now she's part of the workforce. She needs to hire Jim, the high school aged son of her neighbor, to babysit her kids. Although Alice pays Jim $10 a day under the table, he's and getting a bit of disposable income.

Sorry atheists, you’ll be in hell or something, but if you change your mind today there’s still a chance! 	"It's not ""all from paradise lost"", it's drawn from Isaiah 14:12-15, where the ""shining one, son of Dawn"" (*helel ben shahar*) is cast down from Yahweh's throne:

&gt;How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! You said in your heart, “I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of Zaphon; I will ascend to the tops of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High.” But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit.

This isn't originally about Satan, it's about Nebuchadnezzar II (using the imagery of Athtar's attempt to usurp Baal), but it is later interpreted as Satan. You should also refer to the fallen angels in literature like 1 Enoch:

&gt;And again the Lord said to Raphael: '*Bind Azazel hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness*: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not see light. And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. 

This work was familiar to the writer of GMatthew, see Matthew 22:13

&gt;Then the king said to the attendants, ‘*Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness*, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

1 Enoch is in turn based on Genesis 6, which is originally about gods descending to earth and forming demigod children with mortal women, but these gods (sons of El) are later interpreted as angels. 

Also see Luke 10:18, where **Jesus says**:

&gt;**I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven**

and Revelation 12:7-9

&gt;And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. **The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.**

We might also look at the Quran, where Iblis (also known as Shaitan, and identified with Azazel) is cast down from paradise after refusing to bow to Adam. Surah 7:11-13

&gt;Indeed We created you, then We fashioned you, then We asked the angels: ""Prostrate yourselves before Adam."" They all prostrated accordingly except Iblis who did not join those who prostrated. Allah said: ""What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?"" He replied: ""I am better than he; you created me from fire and him from clay."" Allah said: ""Get down from here. You have no right to brag here of your superiority. Get out, henceforth you are of the petty ones."""	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1
976	"&gt; If there is no afterlife and the universe is dying, then on the time scale of the universe there are no precious moments and everything you have ever done is meaningless. But if there will always be conscious experience, then your experiences and actions really are precious, because they shape the future and they are known and valued.

Surely it's the opposite. Money, for example, has value precisely *because* it's limited. If you start printing unlimited money, it becomes literally less valuable than toilet paper. Similarly, unique experiences are those that are, in my opinion, the most precious, precisely because they are unique. If things that were limited had no value, why would anybody care about *once-in-a-lifetime* experiences or opportunities? Wouldn't people value the every-day mundane things instead, because they are *not* as limited? Does a good movie stop having any value when you've finished watching it? Do you think it would have more value if you immediately watched it *again* and *again* and *again*?"	 “You find that people cooperate, you say, ‘Yeah, that contributes to their genes’ perpetuating.’ You find that they fight, you say, ‘Sure, that’s obvious, because it means that their genes perpetuate and not somebody else’s.

Everything from his history of attending a tourney at like 10~ years old, unhorsing Ser Duncan at 16, saving Aerys and escaping with like two arrows in his back, slaying Maelys(?) the Monstrous by cutting his way through the Golden Company, becoming the LC, his boast about being able to cut through five Kingsguard like butter, and finally going to the 'true' heir of the Iron Throne makes me feel like he's one of the only 'true' knights in the series. 

His deeds are heroic, his actions are loyal and honest, and he's one of the few characters that feel wholeheartedly 'good' throughout the series. 

"	"&gt;even if GRRM manages to finish TWOW &amp; ADOS, he won't bother reading them because it took to long. The frustration of the long wait went as far as changing his opinion of the books. He used to love and now less so. 

I hate these people. Hype fans. 

&gt;He made the argument that if J.K Rowling took as long as GRRM to finish the Harry Potter series, it wouldn't feel as frustrating because each Harry Potter book, apart from the penultimate one have closure. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end. They all begin with Harry at his aunt &amp; uncle's,  right before the start of the school year at Hogwarts, a mystery goes down at Hogwarts, Harry &amp; his friends resolve the mystery, and the school year ends. 

Well Harry Potter is a children's/YA book. Of course its structured like that. ASOIAF has a beginning, middle, and end too; even if each book doesn't end with Jon going back to live with Cat each year. 

&gt;If J.K Rowling never finished Harry Potter, sure there would be the disappointment that Harry never faced his end game battle with Voldemort, but at least there would have been satisfaction that he won his last battle. Apart from the penultimate book, Harry Potter &amp; the Half Blood Prince, every book is a battle that Harry goes through and wins. There is always closure to his story arc. 

This might be true up until GOF. Once Voldemort made his official return, people would have wondered about his reign of terror and Harry's destiny.

1011	"Ok so now I feel like you’re just trolling, but in case you aren’t, it might be good to know this. 

Games on consoles are limited by how powerful the console is, and how much processing power they can use. So at the beginning of each project, each team is allotted a certain part of that processing power and a certain part of that RAM. That’s called their audio budget. I’m simplifying it but that’s the general idea.

The nintendo switch is nowhere near as powerful as the newest generation of consoles, so the audio budget is only a fraction of what it would be on something like Horizon Zero Dawn or Neir. But Nintendo was still able to deliver a game with incredible audio that doesn’t feel like it’s sacrificed anything in quality despite sacrificing a massive amount of their toolset. 

Not having enough audio budget in a game can result in things like having to cut effects on sounds to have a better frame rate.

MG/Lenny is such a stud RB1/2 duo, and MG has tons of upside given his insane usage, terrific pass attack in LA, and improved o-line. There are so many question marks with Ingram and Shady: 

- I think there are conflicting schools of thought on Ingram; I actually kind of like him, but there's risk. Basically, New Orleans fucking hates him, and he's on a contract year. Either a) they run him into the ground or b) they don't use him nearly as much as previously. I really don't know which it'll be, even though I would think they run him into the ground given the high powered offense and two-headed monster in the backfield. But I don't think there's solid evidence to suggest either option is inherently what the Saints will do. No matter what, Kamara is the back of the future, has more talent, and will likely outplay him in almost every way. 
- Shady is 30, has a trash pass attack, an awful o-line, and a bad defense that'll necessitate a lot of airing it out. He'll get insane volume, but he'll also have defenses focusing a ton on him since he's Buffalo's only real effective weapon. 

You have 3 top 13 RBs, some solid WRs in Mike, Jeffery, Edelman, Garcon, and Lockett (a nice mix of depth and upside), a good TE and an interesting bench piece in Dion Lewis (sorry but Marlon Mack is the garbageman lol). No need to make this trade since you don't need RB depth, and you'd be trading one of the safest RB options for some really risky guys who would almost certainly not be really needed on your team.

Clarify please? I think i have something different in mind than what you think.

&gt;You are contradicting yourself - morally justifying an act as it coincides with some cultural framework IS an example of moralisze about some moral practices. It is exactly what gives us relativist the ability to say that what that other group does is plain wrong.

No, it doesn't. You can't assert that something is wrong if all of your justification is ""my culture says you're wrong"" becuase again, you have no moral basis to say you have any moral superiority. What puts your cultural view in a position to castigate abother cultural view?

&gt;Depends if the topic in question is relative or not. If a culture says slavery is moral then it is the case since morality is relative issue. If a culture says the Earth is flat then it is not the case since the shape of the Earth is not a relative issue.

Of course im talking about morality, so does the majority of a population hold the 'moral truth' of society?

I couldn't even open the window over our kitchen sink yesterday, because my bump hit the counter and prevented me from reaching it. I can't bend over to scrub the bath tub or do other ""bending over"" chores without getting severe acid reflux.  I am awake at 5 am right now, because baby spent most of last night beating up my insides. So I'm exhausted. 

Husband is picking up the slack.  He is doing all the cooking because my bump is literally interfering with my ability to interact with anything on a counter without straining my arms uncomfortably.

It sounds heavily biased and a lot of it sounds formed out of gossip. I accidentally replied to the bottom of the post so I’ll try and rephrase what I said. 

Basically I can easily give you a scenario that I’ve witness first hand, that can easily justify why an individual chooses not to involve family in their healthcare. The simple answer is judgements or perceived judgement. It’s very common with patients who are very fatigued / depressed to no longer want to participate in activities their significant other values. So scenario here would be an argument, that im willing to bet happened / happens very frequently. The family member / spouse invalidates their physical state by comparing their choice to do “x event” but then can’t go to church with them on Saturday / Sunday (sorry don’t know the denomination) anyways this is the first step in a passive aggressive battle of interpersonal doubt from a family member or loved one. Those two groups of people specifically are most likely to be hurt by your absence from things that are important to them and thus the most likely to orchestrate doubt about your illnesses. You know since most people are not very mindful of the way things affect them, when they feel hurt they have a broad spectrum of responses.

Also I would be interested to know more about this Fire Marshall thing. Part of the duties of a Fire Marshall is to investigate arsonry and it’s hard for me to imagine a Fire Marshall wouldn’t investigate simply because it’s a preachers house.. that means a) she’s admitting the Fire Marshall covered up insurance fraud and that he personally admitted that to someone or b) it’s ill informed gossip."	relationship_advice	relationship_advice	-1

I have had a few friends go to jail because of false restraining orders and false accusations of violations of those orders. I think what needs to happen is that someone files in order, and you file your own order. Because 90% of the time there is a fake order, Person filing a false order will violate the order with a text or a visit to your work or some other harassment. That way, you can show a pattern of negative behavior and violations. I know that the order is automatically both ways, but they never seem to prosecute when the woman violated the order.

If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. **But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense.** If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. [Emphasis mine.]"	"Metaphorically, you mean. Not literally. Otherwise, going by your definition, money is a moral standard too. But how does money tell you what to do? Money doesn't talk, give commands, or have a son to sacrifice to a cross. Or am I going to assume that you go by a non-standard definition for the word 'literally' as well?

See, I think that ultimately, this is all just a dodge. Mental gymnastics at its finest, so that one doesn't have to actually answer the hard questions that their stance on morality and god poses for them. It's the problem I've had when I was a Christian and it was the same answer too many people gave. They'd rather abandon their ability to empathize with their fellow person rather than come to grips with the idea that they've essentially placed the god of Christianity into a position of complete dictatorial power where morality becomes arbitrary at the whim of a being that can decide that child rape is 'good' tomorrow. They'll tell me that slavery is okay, that taking men and women for plunder is fine, and that killing one's own child is a moral imperative so long as their god tells them to, without pausing for a second and thinking ""how is this a fair and good system of morality?"" It's part of the reason why I'm no longer a Christian.

Seriously i am a historian i know my terms i know what i am referencing, i am referring to economic determinism which is a completely different thing to dialectical history. Your definition of dialectical history is correct but it isn't at all what economic determinism is. Completely different concepts completely different schools of thought. One is not more popular than the other they are completely different things. Two separate branches of Marxist historiography. But Marxist historiography is not the be all and end all. For example look at the construct of genocide, formed in the 1940s by Lemkin. The term did not exist before him, but the term has evolved and adapted as a theory. His parameters for its definition proved unworkable and it has evolved in both meaning and application. Marx does not forever define what socialism is in the same way Lemkin's musings on genocide are not final. Marx is the reason we use the word ""class"" instead of ""rank"" and ""order"" his work does not define everything relating to the word ""class"". Current definitions by sociologists of what makes and individual a different class will be very different from Marx, that does not make them wrong.

Don't be hemmed into defining Marx economically. He was also a philosopher and a historian his work encompassed a hell of a lot more. And i said at least partially socialist economies which even under your definition is true of most governments, no government is purely capitalist, all economies have socialist aspects. Socialism is not purely defined by Marx.

Again there is a lot more to the concept than economics although disappointingly most people seem to get fixated on it completely ignoring the political as social aspects of his work, and the fact that the theories now extend and have evolved beyond his work. Nationalisation of healthcare, rail networks and other services is absolutely a socialist political stance and an economic one. Again economic socialism does not always go hand in hand with political socialism. "	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	-1

I'm also getting a bit concerned about the size of the equipment since I might not actually end up shooting very much if it's too big and heavy to carry around. If I would look at a mirrorless system in the same price range instead, what would the equivalent be when it comes to image quality and the focal length for these lenses?"

1114	"Not just 2018 because there are no 38 year old centers on the nba rn

EDIT: nvm Udonis Haslem and Pau Gasol"	"I'm nowhere as high on Doncic as some people here. Reasons for that are that he relies a lot more on athleticism to win than most other Euro prospects, and that athleticism is at best gonna be slightly above average by NBA standards once he reaches his prime, and that's if everything goes his way, and because you can hardly predict how his shooting is gonna translate to NBA because perimeter defenses work very differently in Europe and USA...

**However** you gotta realize that Doncic is playing in Spanish league (and Spanish cup as well I guess) and Euroleague... all of which offer waaay stronger of a competition than what Bargnani had both in Italian league and in Euroleague which was significantly weaker back then (seriously, Euroleague has improved **a lot** since 2005... It's not something you can quantify but I'd say it's at least twice as strong as it was during Bargnani's gig there).

Also, schedules these days are a lot tougher, European players now play a lot more games than they did back in '00s because the new Euroleague system is now set as league + postseason, while the previous one had a group stage and a knockout stage which meant that the weaker teams would usually just play several games before getting kicked out, or legit stop trying to win after getting their first two or three losses. This makes it easier to get a clear picture of players skill level because they now have to play at least 30 games in Euroleague against the best competition Europe has to offer, while back then you'd be basing your projections on a couple of those games and shitton of games against teams from their national leagues that would probably get crushed by most D-League teams.

edit - That last part about playing against trash team is one of the main reasons why so many European big men were getting too much hype for a while... It's already hard to find great big guys for the NBA (it feels like like even the most of star Cs and PFs have quite glaring weaknesses to their game), so it's even tougher in Europe... then it becomes quite a bit easier to dominate against all those back-to-the-basket 30 something dudes who've been playing on their teams because they can't find the adequate replacement for years.

I think he initially wanted to get rid of the subsidies, then economists explained that would be an awful idea.  Now he can say that the subsidies aren't needed anymore because we are taxing foreign panels, so we don't need subsidies to compete.

My friend, John, was with his girlfriend, Joanna, since they were around 15. We were all best friends in high school along with a small group of friends. Over the years some friends dropped off but there were still a few of us left, we would hang out once a week and drink/hang out. John and Joanna got engaged to each other a few years ago, the rest of the group didn't really like Joanna because she always seemed to have one foot out the door, but we were happy for John. 

Last November John called us all and let us know that he and Joanna had broken up because she cheated on him with multiple guys. I can't say I was shocked because she never really seemed trustworthy. What did shock me was when she called me and asked if I wanted to join her for a drink. I turned her down and let John know, turns out she had called our other friends too asking the same question. John was really hurt and we all tried our best to be there for him and help anyway we could. 

Fast forward to last week, John calls us all again and tells us that he's getting back together with Joanna and we should all get together and hang out. Immediately I hate this idea because I really don't respect her as a person after what she did. But after thinking about it for a while, I find myself not respecting John either, why would he get back together with someone who treated him so poorly?

So if a priest is convicted of child molestation and it's proven, at that point I believe they would no longer be ordained. Meaning up until that point when the church condemns them they can give a blessing of any sort as an actual catholic priest. 

That being said if you're argument is that they lose their credibility the moment the act occurs (the act being molesting a child or some other heinous crime/sin), then I would in a sense also agree this is the case as it would be considered a sin I believe to molest a child, and therefore the priest would no longer be on a moral path to his god, but rather to some version of Hell. However the sin of the priest doesn't invalidate the beliefs of the people performing the Eucharist, and presumably the ritual was conducted the same way otherwise. So why would the Wafer and Wine be any less symbolic or meaningful to the believer who is otherwise unaware of the Priests misdeeds and themselves still presumably on a righteous path to their god? 

Following that logic is like saying a famous atheist scientist who made a startling and impactful discovery would have their work be invalidated if they were to later be found out to have mollested a child or any other crime of the sort. 

Or if you'd like another analogy, it would be like saying Bill Cosby's comedy or Kevin Spacey's acting were to no longer be considered good simply because of the disgusting criminal acts they were later exposed of.

1189	"&gt;Forget the metaphysical. Science cannot know about many aspects of the physical -- such as the origin of matter and energy, how life emerged from non life, the cause of the big bang, the cause of the cause of the big bang, and so on.

How can we not know about these aspects of the physical? We currently do not know, and that's great honestly because science doesn't make claims that it knows exactly how everything came to be. The ideas put forth by science are subject to change and revised. It's always changing based on the evidence we uncover, which is great. And what about those things we don't know? We say ""I don't know, let's try to find out."" If they can't find out, we are still left with I don't know. Which is better than making the claim that it was some supernatural being, just because we don't know.

&gt;At best scientists concoct various ""what may have happened"" theories. But atheists believe its all true, on the basis of faith -- even if they don't understand, for example, the complex equations used to ""prove"" the big bang.

I think the word you are looking for is hypothesis because a theory is the best explanation we can come up with given the evidence. It's not some guess that we make, and no we don't all believe these hypotheses to be true, especially on the basis of faith (however we'd have to define faith). We evaluate the evidence and see if it supports their claim. I'm not convinced that the big bang theory used an equation either. From what I've gathered, the background radiation leads to our universe starting with the big bang. Also, it's not like this stuff is only privy to scientists. You or I can look at the evidence ourselves to determine whether or now we should accept these claims. 

I also don't see why these objections to science pertain to the task at hand. How do we determine the supernatural? If we have no reliable way to determine if there is a supernatural, why should I accept the claims that there are?

Antidepressants aren’t stimulants or neurotrophic drugs that produce euphoria, they address neurotransmitter disorders, i.e. medical issues. Yes, our circumstances impact our mood, but major depressive disorder is not cured by people being nice to us.

*during regular season. Once playoffs was over it turned out that none of those teams were the best in their region as none of them were to be champions.

&gt; I mean I guess KR has always been a shit region because they were terrible this year. That's the logic you are showing.

There's a massive difference between a 5 year dominance and winning a tournament, after which you get hard stomped every time you face harder opposition. And yes, FNC/SKT/EDG were a lot better than SK/GE/WE were at the time.

&gt; Edit: Or that FNC wasnt anywhere close to as good as KR in S5 because they were 3-0ed by Koo in the semis.

FNC was not close to the Korean teams at Worlds 2015. There was definitely a gap. They would never win a Bo5 vs Koo, and especially not against SKT. They were at MSI though, but SKT wasn't as strong back then.

And you failed to adress my reasoning that people don't care as much about IEM as they do about MSI or Worlds.

Fuck that, you did nothing wrong - your 20's are about having some fun, and those experiences you had make up part of who you are. You could also compare her to Elon Musk who was a billionaire by 30 if she wants to play that game, because she's being completely unfair and unreasonable by making these kinds of comparisons. Your value as a person isn't measured by just your wealth.

I think if she can 'easily' find someone else then I would let her. I wouldn't want to be with someone that thinks so little of me, and makes me feel like I'm not good enough. You have a job, you're happy at your work - don't change yourself to try to become what she wants you to be. She sounds like the type of person that will also never be happy, and you'll never be 'good enough' for - she's just going to find something else to complain about.

Also generally it is a terrible idea to buy a house with someone when you aren't married or engaged - you haven't even LIVED TOGETHER yet! That's nuts. Sorry but that's just crazy to me that she would want to buy a house with someone she's known less than a year. "	"Getting married just to ""beat the clock"" on having kids is never a good idea honestly.  People raise kids solo all the time, but ideally you do it with someone you love.


Your ex has become fantasy for you.  By your own admission he doesn't want you (he left you) and you went into depression because of him.   You are delusional to harbor this much desire for him.


Your BF's being ""ok"" with this is just another red flag here.  Where lots of people would be like ""yeah no, that isn't cool"" he's ok with it.  He's ok with it because he's DESPERATE for kids - or some other reason you aren't aware of.  But where you both meet in desperation isn't love - it's more like companionship in that you both are pleased to find a ""workable"" situation.


Step 1 in all of this is you need to make peace with not being with your ex.  He doesn't love you and your affection/love/idolization of him is not only unhealthy, but a huge waste of time.  Only after you take that misplaced adoration away are you going to be able to sort your feelings out for your BF.   That could happen in weeks, months or years depending on how much effort you give it.   BUT, I highly suggest you find some counseling and start to unravel this rope. "	relationships	relationships	-1

Perhaps they meant general relativity?

In classical or special relativity gravity and inertia merely cancel 'by accident', in general relativity they do so by definition. No matter if you view the universe from the perspective of the Sun or the Earth general relativity guarantees you won't have to deal with any inertial forces or any other sign you're not in an inertial frame of reference (unless you count the slight drift in the Earth's orbit, but that is negligible).

You will have to deal with the fact that space is curved, but if anything it's curved more heavily at the sun so it'd make more sense to view things from a perspective well outside our solar system (which would probably move more or less parallel to the sun, but that's besides the point). "	"For these ""small"" large numbers, the easiest way to compare them is often just to write them out as power towers. 3\^\^5 is 3\^(3\^(3\^(3\^3))), while a googolplex is 10\^(10\^(100)). Taller towers usually produce bigger numbers, so we might suspect already that 3\^\^5 is the bigger of the two. We can then use a series of equalities and inequalities, moving relatively easily from each to the next, to prove that this is in fact the case. Here's an example of how we might do it:

* 10\^(10\^(100))
* = 10\^(10\^(10\^2)) by replacing 100 with 10\^2
* &lt; 27\^(27\^(27\^3)) since 10 &lt; 27 and 2 &lt; 3, where I'm choosing 27 = 3\^3 since it will be easier to compare with a bunch of other 3s.
* = 27\^(27\^((3\^3)\^3))
* = 27\^(27\^(3\^9))
* = 27\^((3\^3)\^(3\^9))
* = 27\^(3\^(3\*3\^9))
* = 27\^(3\^(3\^10))
* = (3\^3)\^(3\^(3\^10))
* = 3\^(3\*3\^(3\^10))
* = 3\^(3\^(3\^10+1))

Therefore having a law that bans abortion because of your religion teachings is inconsistent with the views and beliefs of most other people in the country, and refuses rights to people just because they aren’t of a particular religion.

Neither of us has ever thought that it would lead to anything permanent and it has not.  A year ago or so, she had some job changes that really rocked her world and she started to have some anxiety issues.  

She started to stress eat a lot and began to put on weight.  My guess is that in the last 12 months she has gained 80-100 lbs.  For someone who started at about 135lbs, this is significant.

Anyway, this weekend during our time together, we had some difficulty in the bedroom.  Her size prevented her from doing some things in the bedroom that had been a part of our normal activities and this really frustrated her.

She totally broke down.  The more I reassured her, the worse I made it.

But if this your approach to problem solving in future relationships (ie. minimal communication), don’t expect your future marriages/relationships to do so well either. 

The truth is that you had plenty of chances to ask for counselling or to sit her down and explain to her that your feelings were waning due to her attitude. At least give the marriage a fighting chance. 

But instead you seemed surprised (?) that there was a 3 hour blowout. And you seem surprised that this is so one-sided. Clearly your wife didn’t think your ‘nagging’ was the same as you losing love for her. 

I’m telling you this because in the future there will be other challenges and barriers in the relationship. And it will come down to how both parties *communicate* and respond that will dictate the way ahead.

Groups with significant political power like the Southern Baptists have made it their mission to convert all Jews to Christianity. They've even formed groups to trick Jews into converting.

1248	"&gt; they don’t come from nothing. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation

It is the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space according to the uncertainty principle.

This allows the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs of virtual particles.

So particles pop into existence in pairs. And it is impossible for that to not happen as long as reality works according to the uncertainty principle.

"	"&gt;It is my perspective then, that if an unborn child has the mental capacity of cockroach, why would we value them any more? We should measure their mental capacity, and compare it to other creatures, and judge accordingly.

Well, it's just not that simple. Mental capacity is certainly not the only metric by which we value life. Nor is there any present evidence of alien life, so let's discard that for now. If this is the case, do you find it moral then to not value the lives of retards? Those who have mental deficiencies? How about newly born infants? Should we not bat an eye at those who find it moral to discard them?

&gt;While I expect it does feel wrong to get an abortion, I view this as biological side-effects stemming from empathy.

It's wrong regardless of any 'feeling' as far as any logical path I have come across. Empathy supporting or not supporting a reason for doing something has nothing to do with it being right or wrong, so that I agree with. Although to make a point of it, empathy is generally correlated with correct moral choices, then the opposite. So the whole mentioning of biological feeling of empathy associated with abortion just seems strange to include.

Furthermore, the question with abortion isn't ""do we value x life over y life"", this is an absurd question with regards to determining if ""x"" has value. The question is, is it moral to kill an unborn child, does its life (x) have value inherently? To which, outside of exceedingly rare exceptions and absurd rationalizations, it's pretty obvious to me that the answer is that it does have value and it is wrong.

There is no evidence to suggest in any definitive way the 'personhood' of an unborn child. They have their own unique D.N.A. and are living and breathing. Does the nervous system and full development of the brain become the determining interval of personhood? Maybe, but probably not. While a threshold exists, it's not entirely obvious where that threshold lies. There is no evidence any which way to confirm. And so the situation is ambiguous. Ambiguity favors what's intuitively true, and even if you don't accept that intuitive truth, ambiguity itself rationally favors pro-life. Imagine a man beating to death a living, human size creature under a blanket, imagine the absurdity of such a scenario in which the police approach and ask ""is that a human being under there?!"", to which the man replies ""I don't know!"", as he continues beating away. Maybe a case could be made if pregnancy was some one to one life trade (their life versus mine), but not only is this not the case, but even then it's a dubious proposition, considering the person, exempting rare circumstances, is fully responsible for being pregnant in the first place. 

It also just reeks of hypocrisy really, that the same ideological movement that approves abortion is generally correlated with being ""unable"" to differentiate between objective lines, crying subjectivity and that matters are not black and white at every turn. But when it comes to abortion, suddenly the perception of complexity and ambiguity in determining something isn't a value they hold any more. So then it seems reasonable then it being nothing more than further symptoms of the lefts futile attempt to rationalize something clearly abhorrent for more of the same attraction to avoidance of responsibility and selfish indulgence."

http://www.visalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/physicianchart.pdf

Additionally, most practices won't hire anyone without appropriate board certification (including family medicine), and it's extremely difficult to start a practice on your own without it, which requires pulling partners and patients away from more qualified practices.

Ultimately, the bottleneck again comes down to post-med-school education funding, and it's the funding there that really causes the problems.  Sure, you could open a thousand new medical schools, but that's just 100,000-200,000 new graduates who will be severely in debt and unable to practice medicine whatsoever because simply graduating medical school isn't enough anymore.

1306	"Why? If a student decides to pray, and others join that student, what is wrong with that? 

I think we are all forgetting something here: No one forced anyone to pray here. I also think another highly important factor is at play: No concessions for the minority. This is the result of a classic struggle for power between a majority and a minority.

Follow me here, this is the same argument with LGBTQ bathrooms. The majority of people are gender binary [93% gender binary population in the United States, according to Census], and prefer to use a bathroom specific to their gender. 

As long as [ NC, I'm looking at you, although it was repealed ] no one is forcing you to do something against your will, in that you are not forced to visit a latrine against your preference, is the idea of the majority use of gender binary bathrooms, indoctrination, or rather is it the will of the majority, which even in any true representative democracy, rules over the minority? We can't deny that it is the majority that shapes policy, however there is an important key here:


The key is to respect the minority enough to make concessions.



My argument is that the majority rules, especially when the minority is a vastly smaller voice. The world is filled with examples of this. You can't throw a rock without hitting an issue that a majority creates for a minority. In every facet of life. Nvidia vs AMD, Intel vs AMD, Religion vs Religion or other, racial, political, iphone vs samsung, samsung vs any other android phone. The minority is almost always dealing with the ramification of being in the minority. While vastly different issues, I can use cellphones as an example. Compare the lack of options for the LG G6 VS the iPhone, or the Samsung. Look at the lack of Vegan options in most restaurants. Look at the lack of tasy low carbohydrate foods! Look at the lack of options for a muslim who prays five times per day in modern western society vs muslim majority countries. The majority always domineers the minority. 


I see no problem with prayer in school, even in municipalities with majority muslim, christian or jewish populations, as long as they add accomodations for those students who practice worship otherwise or do not participate. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.


I feel the school was wrong in these ways:


1.) Teaching against prevailing scientific thought. I believe that science reveals the majesty of God,I think the big bang was a method of creation, generated by his sheer will and power to create. However, a college bound child has to know evolution.


2.) Allowing teachers to bridge the gap between religion and education. They should be mutually exclusive, unless you attend a religious school.


3.) Failing to provide accomodations to non majority worshippers or agnostic/athiests



I feel the school was correct in these ways:


1.) Allowing the majority Christians to express themselves during events like pep rallies, or sporting events. Life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.



You can't change a majority and minority power relationship, you can try till you are blue in the face, but the majority will always run roughshod. The minority will always fight for concession, until they reach the point of comfortability. The majority can however make concessions for minority, and I think that has always been what is successful for both.

When the minority can't get a concession from the majority, for quality of life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, you see complaints, that end up like this.



We all should make concessions for each other. The american way has become corrupted. We dont make concessions for each other, we fail treat each other with respect. We don't respecr each other enough to accomodate each other, or to think about the needs of others, because we are focused on our own desires.

We have to understand that our civil liberties extend right to the border of another individuals civil liberties. If we overlap, we should step back, and give some room, a concession for that person, while we strongly defend our own civil liberty.

The first short film features two main characters as toddlers in a first-encounter scenario.  
The second features the main cast of the first series against a virus (what most movie watchers remember).  
The third short film features the main cast of the second series and partially takes place in America; it is actually completely disconnected plotwise from the first two, but the English dub made up a random reason to tie it in.

Furthermore, the FOURTH short film (about half an hour long) is actually a direct sequel to the plot of the second (the one about the virus) and wraps everything up well, but very few English fans have ever seen it.

&gt;The assertion from forces against Brett M. Kavanaugh that false allegations of rape or attempted rape are extremely rare is rebutted by a number of studies, researchers say.

Shark attacks are rare too, but I bet if someone sees a dorsal fin in the water, you'll hustle your ass up to the beach, won't you?

&gt;Liberals on TV and social media said repeatedly during the Senate confirmation process that only 2 percent of charges are lies — meaning there likely would be truth in the majority of such charges, such as that of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused now-Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her 36 years ago.
Brent E. Turvey, a criminologist, wrote a 2017 book that dispels this notion. His research, and that of two co-authors, cited statistical studies and police crime reports. One academic study showed that as many as 40 percent of sexual assault charges are false. Mr. Turvey wrote that the FBI in the 1990s pegged the falsity rate at 8 percent for rape or attempted rape complaints.

&gt;“There is no shortage of politicians, victims’ advocates and news articles claiming that the nationwide false report for rape and sexual assault is almost nonexistent, presenting a figure of around 2 percent,” writes Mr. Turvey, who directs the Forensic Criminology Institute. “This figure is not only inaccurate, but also it has no basis in reality. Reporting it publicly as a valid frequency rate with any empirical basis is either scientifically negligent or fraudulent.”

&gt;A recent study supports this assessment. The Pentagon issues an annual report on sexual assaults in the military. **Nearly one-quarter of all cases last year were thrown out for lack of evidence**, according to a report released in May.

And the feminist ideologues will assert that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, while demanding that you draw an assumption solely because it favors their narrative, rather than based on the weight of the evidence...which is absent.

&gt;“It appears that die-hard opponents of Kavanaugh have invented a narrative to imply that false accusations hardly ever happen,” said Elaine Donnelly, who directs the Center for Military Readiness.

Remember back in the Duke Lacrosse days when their narrative was ""Why would a woman EVER lie about rape?""

&gt;Women’s advocates say that an unfounded case doesn’t necessarily mean the accuser was lying.

What did I just write?

&gt;The National Sexual Violence Resource Center puts the false report rate at 2 percent to 10 percent.

&gt;“Research shows that rates of false reporting are frequently inflated, in part because of inconsistent definitions and protocols, or a weak understanding of sexual assault,” the center said.

Translation from bullshit-to-English: Assume in favor of our narrative; ignore any lack of evidence.

Why would a woman ever lie about rape? Why would we ever lie to you about the frequency of rape?

Same snake oil in a new bottle.

&gt;Mr. Turvey quotes a study by researcher Edward Greer, past president of the Association American Law Schools. He traced the one and only source for the “2 percent” assertion to a 1975 book, **“Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,”** which quoted statistics from New York City, not from across the nation.

Written by Susan Brownmiller, who in the same book, implicitly justified the murder of Emmett Till for the false accusation of whistling at Carolyn Bryant, who got her White Knight hubby Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam to torture Till, shoot him, and then dump his body in a river.

 #BelieveWomen

&gt;Mr. Turvey cites 10 studies that debunk the 2 percent assertion in the U.S. and abroad.

&gt;“The power of any lie is equal only to our desire to believe it,” Mr. Turvey wrote. “Specifically, our need and eagerness to believe it. This is the problem with belief — which is accepting something as true or correct without proof.”

Feminism is an identitarian cult and more men are slowly waking up to that fact because Feminists are hell bent on serving up proof of it every day."	"&gt;The social problems we do have are caused by the abandonment of individual responsibility. No one is ever at fault for their own problems and no one has the power to improve their own circumstances. This is the ideology of today's Western society.

Why would someone need to take responsibility when the modern-leftists will gladly solve your problems for you? Also personal responsibility is difficult and full of unknowns, which is scary. People would much rather be comfortable in their echo-chambers of conformity rather than face reality. This seems to be the US democratic platform over the last 8 years or so.

I honestly think this is in part due to social media. We can very easily build ourselves into these echo-chambers with next to no effort; find a group, build a friends list, purge anyone who disagrees. The image nails it perfectly with trying to encourage the face-to-face discussions. It used to take so much more effort to have this attitude, with real genuine alienation from the community, before Twitter and Facebook became so prevalent."	MensRights	MensRights	-1

I may be wrong, so don’t take this personally. but it seems you think that because/if she lied about the reason she’s not interested, that there’s less of a reason to take her disinterest seriously. The reason why isn’t that important because whatever it really is she’s still not interested.

Another part would have to be that if you delete your primary then the second save moves up to primary. That way you can't just play on the second and continuously delete your primary. Convoluted, I know =\

Still, this method would get people multiple saves if they want to mess around without deleting their main save. It would also prevent just as many trading exploits as the current system.

Most games do a type of handshake where simply the game clients' movement and actions are sent to the server and the server confirms if it was a hit/miss for example. Your client won't know until the server sends back a confirmation, at which point your client either assumed the next position or syncs back to what the server told you. You don't want to give trust to the client as it opens up for a lot of easy cheating. On the other hand for games where it's mostly about CoOp and cheating doesn't matter, you can do a lot more calculations client-side so each player kind of lives in their own world and instead syncs each state with one another asynchronously, or parallel to your own gameplay. It may result in your teammate taking damage visually when nothing hitting him on your screen, but at least the feeling of lag is heavily diminished since hitboxes can be calculated locally entirely. Netcode is an interesting topic and handled in many different ways. Dying when behind cover in Battlefield will never not rustle my jimmies.

Mesmer uses Mantra of Recovery/Mantra of Resolve to break allies out of fear when stability didn't work to prevent it.

The same goes for sharing stability via Mantra of Concentration, the charge effect is entirely selfish and doesn't stunbreak yourself either. 

Mantra of Distraction has a 4s cd on charge use so you're unlikely to pump both into the same breakbar. Otherwise you're likely using it for interrupts which must be performed with the proper timing.

As a chronomancer you are refunded the first mantra charge if used during CS but not the second one, and any mantras charged during CS will revert and lose all charges once it ends. Thus while the gain is only a single charge at best the optimal situation is to have two full charges on your mantras as you enter CS.

One case where it **is** optimal to consume all charges immediately is healing allies via Restorative Mantras.

"I see lots of great theories being posted about Zeke all the time. One of the more prominent ones that is always being discussed is the possibility that Zeke was turned into a spy by Eren Kruger and that he is currently working to liberate Eldians. These theories often provide good evidence for this, but none seem to ever discuss the fact that **Zeke's inner monologue demonstrated so much hatred for Paradis Eldians** as he showered the Survey Corps with boulders during the Return to Shiganshina arc.

**Zeke's inner monologue is the best insight we can get as to what he's truly planning behind the scenes.** Often times theories will state ""Zeke said X to Y person, meaning he's planning Z plan."" The thing is, these could all just be lies. 

**We've seen Zeke interact with Marleyans, who would immediately stomp on his plans if they got any hint that he was not the loyal, obedient kid wonder they think he is.** Of course, Zeke won't mention what he's truly up to around them. He'll put up a facade. ""Loyal boy wonder here to serve Marley.""

**Literally, we've only ever seen Zeke interact with two groups of people, the second group being the Eldian Warriors who can relate to how it feels to be an Eldian.** These warriors, however, could also be the loyal-to-Marley type to rat him out in a heartbeat if they get the sense that he's not the loyal, obedient kid wonder they think he is. Of course he'd never say anything to raise their suspicions. He'd never let them get a glimpse as to what is going on in his mind.

**His inner monologue however is a true insight as to how he feels and what he thinks of society, particularly Paradis Eldians.** We're shown a glimpse into his thought process, free from restrictions and fake acts he has to put on around pretty much every single person ever.

If Zeke was turned into a spy by Kruger in order to serve Eldia, *why does he hate Walldians so much?*

  Could it be that someone as smart as Zeke truly did buy into the ""Marleyan Eldians good, Walldians bad"" propaganda and is only working for Marleyan Eldians?

If it was 20 minutes between blips of content for you, you were playing the game wrong. A majority of shrines are *much* longer than you're giving credit, as well (most take 10 minutes). Given that I've had several friends complete the game in 10 hours or less, your description of the game loop is inaccurate.

&gt; Spot on criticism if you ask me.

I agree with the title (that more might have been done with the Yiga), but little else in the article. As Skyward Sword was the low point in the series for me, and Zant being forgettable, trying to say ""copy/paste a mechanic from previous games"" just felt hallow. The reviewer also misses that the disparity between the Yiga as initially presented and how they are once you've seen their hideout is intentional. 

Most of this article could be summed up as ""I wasn't given a linear Zelda game."" At it's heart, this article just shows that BotW wasn't the reviewer's style of game, but on the whole, they miss the mark as to ""what's wrong."" As someone who prefers story and avoids exploration in a game, I think BotW did these aspects well (could have used some more modern Hyrule story, particularly with the Rito).

1379	Can you give a rundown for an idiot on whether or not this move would violate whatever CRTC provisions ensure net neutrality?	"I am somebody who I am sure you would consider a leftist (I hate Jordan Peterson and I am always happy to see him getting kicked off of college campuses by students). Yeah - it's an insult. Or at least, it's an American term (I mean that it is popular right now due to America) in vogue due to Donald Trump which I would never self apply.

I would think it would be obvious to you, but I don't consider my political motivations to be anything remotely close to ""ah yes - no more free speech and while we're at it, let's destroy the economy!""

Total and complete freedom of speech (like allowing Nazis to openly run around spreading propaganda with the idea that you can't censor any ideas because bad people might get into power and censor the wrong ideas) is an American thing. I - and I'm sure most people who you think are ""working to suppress free speech"" am not against freedom of speech. I do, however, think that there are points at which it needs to be limited. Hence why we have hate speech laws in Canada which are protected under section 1 of the Charter.

&gt;The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such *reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society*.

Frankly I think most of the people you're talking about think it is a waste of time and energy for us to be trying to talk down nazis and white supremacists when nothing productive is ever going to come out of it, and the only possible outcome is ignorant people latching onto said people's dumb xenophobic ideas and running with them.

None of that applies to Jordan Peterson, of course - he's just a dick and I have no problem seeing other people be dicks right back to him. I think it's a huge joke to talk about that as if his freedom of speech is being violated. Can you go online and in all the major papers and read about him? Yes? I think he's got plenty of voice, then.

Plus the people you hear about who are cutting off his speeches are like 18 years old and, like all 18 year olds (hey baby boomers, what were you doing at age 18, huh?) tend to go a little bit over the top in their actions because they are just finding their voice and forming opinions. So it's really ridiculous how people talk about this like it's some giant downfall of free speech. I went to university from 2011 to 2016 and never once saw one prof or student get shut down for being offensive. I did, on the other hand, see half a class straight up walk out on a first class when they found out it was going to be focused on indigenous issues. Universities are still archaic and tied to a really old school, Eurocentric worldview. It's a huge joke to act like the right wing doesn't have plenty of power in them.

The people being upset by this stuff are the same people who don't understand that ""politically correct"" is basically a shorter way of saying ""not openly being a dick to minorities"". It's so laughable to me when I see old white guys blathering about how the world is ending because they can't make mean spirited jokes about gay people or trans people or whatever minority they feel like being a dick to.

Or people who get all riled up about having to actually treat First Nations people and customs with respect. Same thing. That gets filed under ""forced political correctness"" by people when it's actually ""not being a complete dick for no reason"".

Same thing with people acting like millennials are precious little snowflakes for caring about respecting non-binary people who don't want to identify as he/she. Who gives a fuck? Why get all up in arms about it like a dick when you can just treat people the way they want to be treated (creating a more diverse and interesting society in the process)?  If somebody wants to identify as male or female or ""they"" or something just call them that and stop whining so much. It may not matter to you but it matters a lot to them - and if you're not a dick that should be enough to make you care. (Hence why Jordan Peterson is a dick who basically goes around being a dick professionally 24/7.)

The best solution in this scenario is to get off 4Chan/Reddit/RuneScape, no more /b/.

You can get hundreds of up-votes with self-deprecating posts on Reddit/4Chan but at the end of the day that does nothing for anyone.

"Also, I think that sound dampening gives people a false sense of security.  They don't hear the road noise, or the engine, or the other vehicles on the road, and it lulls them (at least subconsciously) into believing they're safer.

I spent some time this weekend driving on the interstate in heavy rain, and I was astounded at the number of people who went screaming past me at 85mph when visibility was only 100ft.

I'm not a slow driver, but I don't fuck around with rain, snow, or poor visibility.  On a dry, sunny day with light traffic, I'm comfortable setting the cruise control at 85mph on the interstate - with a half-mile of visibility and good traction, I'm confident about being able to stop in time even if there's a stationary object on the roadway.  But if there's even a light sprinkling, I'm back down at the speed limit or lower, and doubling my follow distances (which are already generous).  Meanwhile, everyone around me thinks that the ABS and stability control can give them dry-pavement stopping power while hydroplaning.

I honestly believe it's a combination of things - the normalization of distracted driving, the lack of formal training, the lack of understanding of how friction and reaction time work, the false sense of security from improvements in safety - that have contributed to the decline of safe driving over the last 10 years.  When I started driving 16 years ago, the sight of a distracted driver weaving in their lane was fairly rare - I might see somebody doing this a few times a week.  Now, on just one leg of my daily commute, I see a half-dozen people who can't even stay in their lane because they're fucking around with their phone or their infotainment system.  Occasionally, I even see people *watching movies* while driving - one guy was holding his phone in landscape orientation in the middle of his steering wheel with a movie playing on it.

Grandstand tickets (especially for Trucks or Xfinity series) are usually very reasonably priced, and many NASCAR venues allow you to bring in food and drinks."	"Before we begin, let us establish the proper framework to look at matrices:
Matrices represent linear transformations.  A transformation is like a machine that takes in objects (vectors) and spits out other objects of the same type (vectors).  Linear transformations are special transformations, in that if you have a shape and you draw lines from the origin outward that have tick marks at regular intervals, a linear transformation will keep those lines straight and the distance between tick marks the same.  This means the only operations you can really do are scaling and rotating line relative to the origin.

Now, when you send something through a matrix, some times you want to know how they change the size of objects you put in.  One way to look at this is if you have a hypercube made of unit vectors on the axes, what is the resultant volume of the hypercube after you put it in the linear transformation.  Now, recall that these transformations can only rotate and scale things evenly.  Pure rotation is not captured by the determinant.  Only the scaling (for your own exercise, try plugging in a rotation matrix).  Also, because things are scaled evenly, the scaling factor on this hypercube stays the same even if you take smaller cubes.  Furthermore, if you have shape that are nice enough, you can make a pixelated shape from cubes that all get scaled basically the same way.  So this does a good job at capturing the change in side the transformation does.  In geometric terms, this is what the determinant is.

Now that we kinda have this, we can start assigning this ""size"" measure to matrices.  This is why we can see them in limits or other calculations, as they in a sense represent the size of the matrix.  There are other ways, of course, to assign a size to the matrix, but the determinant is one of them.

In the field of vector calculus, we like using determinants because the things we look at are nice and generally differentiable.  Differentiability means that locally, your function/transformation is linear.  If you zoom into X^2,  you will realize that it looks very similar to a line with a slope of 2x.  Understanding that you are using linear transformations to approximate functions is one of the main ideas of calculus.  Now, it would be helpful to understand how this changes things in a small, specific area.  If they are nice functions/transformations, I can locally represent this as a linear transformation (and if it is finite dimensional in euclidean space, this is a matrix).  The determinant will allow you to calculate the change in size this local area will do to you.  

Now, one more note is that determinants can be done basis-free and a very interesting general definition.  However, I think that is a discussion for another time.

Ever since I saw the title for this short on IMDB  my interest was piqued, being an Einsturzende Neubaten fan from way back &amp; quite fond of The Bad Seeds output prior to mid90s.
But had no luck finding it.

A talented actor like Imperioli being the lead character only adds to my curiosity to catch a gander at this short film.

I suspect the Bargeld reference might be more about The Bad Seeds rather than Neubaten given a tonne of minor characters are credited as 'Nick Cave Fan' ?

1424	"Except this is exactly what you're doing. I didn't state that arguments for papal *primacy* didn't exist until the 19th century. I said that infallibility wasn't a thing until then. Popes throughout history have tried claiming some form of supremacy over the Church, and have always been shut down by the rest of the patriarchs. But the egotism of Rome leads them to profess that it magically wasn't the other 4 patriarchates who were right, but rather the one man standing on a hill shouting for power...while ironically claiming to be ""Catholic"". Somehow the entire Catholic church, even the monophysites, have NEVER accepted any of the current claims of Rome, but were to believe the claims of this one bishop over the rest of Christendom......wow.   
St Pope Gregory had some choice words about anyone who tried to do just that.            
     
There isn't a single piece of actually evidence to support any of your claims. Claiming things requires proof. You can say until you're blue in the face that the pope had special powers (to ratify councils lmao) but there isn't any evidence to even begin to show that. Leo didn't even attend Chalcedon, but were supposed to believe it wasn't authoratitave without him...because that makes sense. He's so powerful and important, yet can't be bothered to even show up despite bishops from all around the known world were attending. Just like every single other council. The irony of bringing up Chalcedon is that the emperor refused to even hear Leo. Leo had been asking for a council to be called for years but kept getting told ""no"" by Theodosius II.  
Some universal and supreme pope, amirite.    
And I guess that means that all the declarations that affirmed and ratified contract at subsequent councils we're just all the other bishops pretending to be little popes themselves.    
   
Councils were held that specifically dealt with the problems developing in Rome (Quinisext, Eighth Ecumenical Council) but rather than having humility and accepting that the declarations of THE ENTIRE CHURCH outside of Rome *might* have some weight, Rome would rather stick their fingers in their ears and shout ""nope"" while claiming to be heroic.

I guess the same questions could be applied to different sections of individual links. Could one manufacture chains with a direction, so each link is stronger at the point of greater force (the location of which could (?) depend on which direction the chain is being pulled)?. Anyway, I digress... 

I understand your answer if we imagine the chain is being pulled in one direction as this effectively creates a succession of forces with the 'forward' links bearing more weight (since they are carrying more links 'behind' them than other links further 'down' the chain), with the ultimate link having only the force of its own mass and friction acting upon it. 

E.g. Anchor point + three links (each 1kg in mass) + load (10kg in mass), all being dragged in direction of anchor point. We have four intersections between these five objects, experiencing ('forwards' to 'backwards') 13kg, 12kg,11kg, 10kg forces. (Right?). 

But now let's imagine a chain with equal forces applied in opposing directions (rather than dragging a load in one direction) - there are no leading or trailing links(?). 

E.g. 5kg force pulling 'left' + three links (1kg each) + 5kg force pulling right. We again have four intersections between the five objects. So do we have a force of 13kg acting on each intersection as each bears the cumulative mass and force of every other object in the system?

And what effect would gravity have - would gravity cause certain links to have more stress exerted upon them than others?

You'd obviously want the strongest people in a chain of people at the top holding on to the edge of the cliff above the shark infested waters, but where would you want the strongest if they were hand in hand spanning a ravine? My instincts say divided between the ones holding the ravine edges and the one in the middle, but maybe it wouldn't make a difference... "	askscience	askscience	-1

&gt; Like a mindless drone taught to feed on what fox news is regurgitating through your tv.

The irony here is thick enough to bludgeon someone to death with. 

&gt; This incident has to do with supporting Americans who are being discriminated against for doing something thousands do in most restaurants or services on a daily basis.

I have no idea what that Starbucks does normally, or what the laws are in that city, but, at least where I live, stores can kick you out if you don't buy anything. 

&gt; 've waited for 20-30 minutes in places while waiting on a friend and I didn't end up getting arrested. How badly disconnected are you with reality that you can't put yourself in this situation and realise what happened was unjust and shouldn't happen to anybody. 

I had went hiking and stayed out longer than I expected and on my way back to the city I passed a small shop and I stopped in to see if I could use the restroom. I had to get a key at the counter and they said it was customers but I could just buy a small bag of chips and it'd count, so I bought it and went to the bathroom. Now, I would have preferred to just go to the bathroom without the hassle but it was their store. I could always pressure the establishment or maybe talk to the owner or something but, since it is private property, if I were to ignore them and they called the cops I would totally be trespassing. And considering my history with cops telling me to leave places I was trespassing (I was in to BMX a lot when I was younger, 16-22ish, and we'd go ride around industrial parks and stuff) I am fairly certain they would first just ask me to leave before putting cuffs on me. 

Now, this all glosses over the actual issue here, so let me try and dumb this down for you. They should have sued Starbucks, not the police. Is it a shitty situation? Sure. But just like having a bad day at work and taking it out on your boyfriend/girlfriend, having been wronged doesn't then give you the right to go wrong someone who had nothing to do with it. The police, and by extension the city, had no culpability here. If I am a private property owner and I want someone off my property, the police actually don't have a right to just not remove them. In fact, since the government, and by extension the police, are supposed to protect and enforce my private property rights, if the police show up and don't remove the trespasser, I can sue. This is why I don't think the city actually settled to prevent them from being found culpable (because they weren't) but rather, to appease the large group of people who were already preparing for protests. Protests which, historically, have had more than their fair share of destruction of private property or violence from alt-right counter-protestors.

1436	"No. I have not read the discussion of this topic in the Catholic church. I know predetermined is stated Colossians I believe. The Jews did preach repentance but it is not up to man to repent. It is up to God to bring repentance into the person. You can choose to repentant. If God decides that you will not repentant it doesn't matter what you say. Remember when Peter told Christ that he would not deny him and Jesus said that he would deny him three times before the rooster crows. Peter had foreknowledge of what could happen and he still denied Christ. Where was his free will there? 

Also, I think there is a verse in Jeremiah that states it is not might or human will but by the spirit of the Lord. The idea of free will was inject by the Roman empire when Christianity became the national religion. The original eastern thought was conflated with western thought which causes confusion."	"Disclaimer: I'm not religious what so ever....

So if a priest is convicted of child molestation and it's proven, at that point I believe they would no longer be ordained. Meaning up until that point when the church condemns them they can give a blessing of any sort as an actual catholic priest. 

That being said if you're argument is that they lose their credibility the moment the act occurs (the act being molesting a child or some other heinous crime/sin), then I would in a sense also agree this is the case as it would be considered a sin I believe to molest a child, and therefore the priest would no longer be on a moral path to his god, but rather to some version of Hell. However the sin of the priest doesn't invalidate the beliefs of the people performing the Eucharist, and presumably the ritual was conducted the same way otherwise. So why would the Wafer and Wine be any less symbolic or meaningful to the believer who is otherwise unaware of the Priests misdeeds and themselves still presumably on a righteous path to their god? 

Following that logic is like saying a famous atheist scientist who made a startling and impactful discovery would have their work be invalidated if they were to later be found out to have mollested a child or any other crime of the sort. 

Or if you'd like another analogy, it would be like saying Bill Cosby's comedy or Kevin Spacey's acting were to no longer be considered good simply because of the disgusting criminal acts they were later exposed of.

There was this one girl in particular that always stuck out to me. We’d have to wear jeans all the time because, well, horses. I was usually in charge of all the miscellaneous stuff since we rarely had boys, and even then they were usually put into groups with the girls during the day. So I was only a counselor about half the time. 

So this particular week, it was ridiculously hot and we were down a counselor for the teen girls, so I was their counselor during lessons and whatnot during the day and then they’d join the younger girls and their counselor the rest of the time. 

Well, on Sunday,  it was hot that we all just wore shorts. We got out to the barn and started getting them on horses just to see how experienced they were. That was when I saw the cut marks on this girls legs and arms, quite a few of which looked no more than a few days old. 

So I talked to my boss and told her about it. She already knew. She also knew my history with the same problem and decided to put her in my group. The rest of the week went fantastic. She was really a great kid, but staff aren’t allowed to keep in contact with campers outside of camp (with some obvious exceptions). So after that week, I had no idea what happened to her.

I ran into her last year, 7 years after that summer. She’s still the same girl I remember, but so different at the same time. She said things got a whole lot worse after that week, but that week meant so much to her, and she later got the help she needed and went on to work at the same camp.

I m not sure i understand what you mean here. Sorry.

&gt;  every site and person says deadeye is weak in pvp

Core thief is great for pvp though. I remember that Sindrener (one of the top Thieves) was recently using Core thief in tournaments. As far as I know, some people prefer to use core thief instead of daredevil (the HoT specialisation) because core Sword+dagger thief has better teamfight potential than the dagger+pistol daredevil.

Do you have any plans on buying Heart of Thorns?

It seems to me that you are mostly focused on PvP and WvW. If that is the case then go and play PvP with any class you want untill you find something that you really like. Then you can decide if you want to use the boost or not and if you want to level your thief or if you prefer to play some other class. You have nothing to lose.

Finally in another post you said:
&gt; i dont want to learn the thief and get used to its abilities if im going to quit it at 80 anyway. I feel no need to farm and get hearts anymore if i anyway quit the thief. I am learning the thief and getting used to its abilities which will bother me when i start a new character.

Leveling a thief is great for 1 thing: you have to learn to dodge, because the thief is the less forgiving class in that regard.

Since you want to pvp and be competitive I would suggest you keep leveling your thief and practice dodging, get used to it and make it a habit to dodge when needed. Train your muscle memory so that dont have to think to dodge, but you do it out of reflex. 

Getting used to thief will not bother you when you start a new character. If you know how to play a thief then it means you know how to kill a thief and you know how a thief can kill you. This will help a lot if you want to be good in PvP.

And ask him (and this is likely, even subconsciously on his part) if delaying/not making a decision is his way of saying ""no kids.""  I mean, he has these fears, but what's the waiting about?

If can't communicate/decide effectively, perhaps tell him that you're going to take his ""I don't know yet"" as a ""no,"" and that he doesn't need to waste his time thinking about if he wants kids anymore, because you've decided it's off the table, for your own peace of mind, because you can't live with the uncertainty.

"I do not know the specifies of this poison pill but typically all shareholders except the party which crossed the 15% threshold will have the right to purchase a proportional amount of shares at a discount.

For example lets say a public company has 100 shares and an outside party acquires 15 of those shares (15%): the company will temporarily halt trading of its shares and give all the other shareholders the right to buy one additional share for each share they own at a discount. After this the company will have 185 shares meaning the 15 shares the hostile party holds has been diluted down to 8.1% from 15%.

Grab defeated Uber in South East Asia.

It might seem like there's significant rivalry in Singapore, but for the entire region, we're just a drop in the ocean. 

Singapore has a population of about 5.6 million. Indonesia, SEA's largest economy, has 250 million consumers.

A [recent survey](https://ecommerceiq.asia/cp-ride-hailing-apps-in-indonesia/) looking at Indonesia has the following estimates for market share in major cities:

* Go-Jek: 56%
* Grab: 33%
* Uber: 8%
* Non user: 3%

Now, I can't account for every other country in SEA, but when we see that Uber is getting absolutely slaughtered in the biggest piece of the pie, it doesn't really matter if it's winning in Singapore when considering the region as a whole. 

To add to this, Grab's reach is to about 178 cities (I'm not sure because the number keeps changing, but only upward) across SEA. Uber lists only 51 countries on its website. If accurate, that means that Uber is only in about a third of the fights. Even if Uber had total market control in every SEA city it operates in, it would still be losing 2/3rds of the region as a whole because it can't fight those battles. Singapore is one of those cities. Winning or losing the battle here doesn't matter if you've already lost the war.

Personally, I'm curious to see what happens between Go-Jek and Grab, especially given Go-Jek's plans to expand beyond Indonesia, and they are both competing for the same payments space now. Plus, Uber shared a few investors with Go-Jek (Tencent, for example, which invested US$1.2bn last year). "	"&gt; 3.7% over 20 years is really really mediocre at best though.

True, some Christians believe that. I shouldn’t speak for them, they can defend their own sects. I only argue for the validity of Catholicism, since that’s the faith I align with.

I hate to be making this kind of post, but I'm at the end of my rope so here goes.

I'm sure you guys have all heard of Grailed, if you haven't, then it's a website for reselling clothing and shoes. This incident started out pretty normal, about a month ago on February 11th. I found a leather jacket I liked, and after talking with the seller a bit, we agreed on a price of 220. OK, cool -- I whip out Paypal and go through the steps, logging in, confirming, etc.

Suddenly, Grailed says the Paypal transaction didn't go through. That's fine, I try again with another Paypal email and it still doesn't go through. Whatever, I forget about it and it slips my mind for a couple hours until a young 219.27 dollar charge appears on my bank account statement. Considering that Grailed never told me about the payment going through or instructing the seller to send over the jacket, this came as a bit of a surprise.

That's still okay, right? Money doesn't just disappear. I immediately emailed Grailed about this, and they give me a nice copy pasted reply in return, telling me to contact Paypal about this. OK, I contact Paypal -- they tell me to contact Grailed. The seller says he doesn't have it either. After a big wild goose chase between the companies, I dig into Paypal and they say, searching up both my bank account number and debit card number, that the transaction doesn't exist. In the past, present, or future. Grailed tells me the same, and apparently this 219.27 has just up and walked out on me.

Which just leaves me with more questions. How do two companies just lose track of two hundred dollars? Where did the 73 cents go? Isn't there any sort of Payment Protection?

Oh yeah, Grailed does have one. They referred me to this guy called Chris, and I was excited to get better customer support. I ask about Grailed's Payment Protection, which should cover any sort of me paying money and not getting product, right? Sounds nice, but Chris gave some generic advice that the money should come back sometime within a couple of days and then immediately stopped replying.

It's now been more than an entire month. No reply, no Purchase Protection, no help from any companies involved. I filed a chargeback and Paypal said they needed 90 days to process a merchant dispute, after which I will undoubtedly be unable to appeal again because of how long it's been. It's insane how Grailed can skim a cool 10% of anything bought or sold, and not support their customers in this case. I've bought and sold over 1500 on Grailed and apparently that's not even worth a reply. I'm very frustrated that I have to make this Reddit post to even give an ounce of response from either company, and I urge you not to believe anything Grailed says about Purchase Protection or anything like that.

Together they have several supercarriers, a large and well-trained/equipped army, a gigantic industrial base, and some of the most advanced military technology in the world. There are also two nuclear powers, the UK and France, who both hold enough of an arsenal to dissuade any aggressor state. 

The combined might of those forces would crush Russia in a war. There's no question about it - the Russian military still largely uses Soviet era equipment, Russia's economy is about the same size as Italy's, and their status as a power is only diminishing these days, despite their uncanny knack for projecting power far beyond what other nations of their magnitude are capable of. Maybe 30 years ago the US was the main thing stopping Europe from being dominated by Russia, a superpower at the time, but not anymore - the EU is more than capable of standing on its own two feet these days. 

The notion that America alone guards Europe is a lie propagated by those with an interest in keeping the US military-industrial complex as bloated and parasitic as it already is; if America reduced its military spending to a more sensible proportion of its budget then maybe things which the rest of the first world have, like public healthcare and decent worker's rights, would start looking more affordable."

They said something, which is objectively wrong, and people are discussing counterpoints.

It is not harder to pause a PC than a console. That's just dumb.

And a PC can be hooked up to a TV and used for couch gaming exactly like a console.

Those are not benefits of consoles, they are benefits of ""I put this machine in my lounge-room"".

The benefits of consoles are ease of use, and price. They didn't reference ease of use at all, and they made it sound like PCs are incapable of being used with a TV. Yeah, people are gonna discuss why that isn't really correct...

I can't see a single post nit-picking their reference to the pricing advantage, because that's a fair point to give the console. People are just discussing the other points that don't seem like fair points to make...

When I first built my PC, all I had to do was put it right next to my PS4, and swap over the HDMI. I could use the same PS4 controllers, on the same games (aside from exclusives), using the same TV, sitting on the same couch.

Same Deal if I take the PC to someone's house, all I need to do is swap over the HDMI from their console to my PC, and we are up and running with PC Couch gaming.

Of the few people I know who have a gaming PC, they all use it in the exact same way as they used their console - they just swapped out the console for a PC.

I'm not trying to downplay consoles, they are still great for gaming on, and the ease of use is a major, *major* plus (goddamn can PC get frustrating with driver issues and firmware updates and whatnot), but the positives this person put forth as if they were an inherent benefit of consoles just doesn't fly...

It's like the difference between ""I prefer coke to pepsi"" and ""Coke is better than pepsi because it's always cold, while pepsi is always warm, also I refuse to refrigerate pepsi.""

Given the immense number of earth-like planets in the universe, it seems unlikely that earth's the only one with life on it.

"It seems to me humans are ""programmed"" in this way too, just in a more roundabout way. 

Consider a human and a robot trying to get an apple from a tree. You might say that the robot would have to be programmed to raise its hand and pick the apple off the tree, whereas the human could consider its options and put together a course of action which would get it the apple (that course of action is likely going to be raising its hand and picking the apple off the tree). 

However, I think that is a simplistic view of what a robot can be programmed to do. Imagine instead of programming a robot to pick the apple off the tree, we program the robot to think more like a human would. Systematically (or maybe randomly, if we really want to mimic humans) go through its experiences, and either remembering an experience in which someone picked an apple and thus had an apple, or remembering an experience of grabbing an object and moving it to where you want it. Perhaps perform the calculations to predict the future (if I raise my hand to pick the apple, this will lead to me having an apple) or remembering intermediate steps (I remember that picking the apple requires me to first move my arm). 

It seems to me such programming would do what you say humans do, and not what you say robots do. 

This robot would require a lot of practical teaching (just as humans do), a good sensory system (which we can't yet make, but there is nothing impossible about it)."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

This schedule takes a couple weeks to get used to as well, So a 3-day study is virtually pointless. 

 Some tricks I've learned over the years;

1. Don't revert back to a 1st shift sleep schedule on the weekends (very difficult some times, especially with family) 
This is really the big one, everyone I know that burns out on third does this.

2. Don't eat for 4 hours before bed- time, though i'm not sure why this helps you sleep better. 

3. Kick caffeine completely. Often times 3rd shifters become so reliant  on caffeine, that it starts to impact their sleep

4. Go out in the sun as often as possible. I take a vitamin d supplement when I can't get any sunlight (you can keep your ""vitamins are useless"" comments. It works for me, even if its psychosomatic) 

5. Find or create a quiet, dark, cool place to sleep.
 A little cold with some white noise, seems to be the consensus among my peers (about 250 people in manufacturing setting) 

6. Make sure the people around you understand the need to respect your sleep,  especially spouses and kids.

The biggest thing in my opinion was cutting out the garbage from my diet (pizza, Chinese food, fried buffalo wings, beer/soda, potato chips, etc.). I took my diet to the extreme at first by limiting myself to &lt;1500 calories made up of as much protein as possible and no carbs + biking. You WILL feel like absolute shit if you do that, but I was dumb and thought “less calories is more weight loss, right?” It was a big mistake I’ve learned from. 

so I’d advise cutting out as much sugar as possible, limiting carbs, incorporating a lot of greens, and having lots of smart snacks. I realized it was more expensive to eat healthy but it’s for your health. One of my favorites was venison jerky which is extremely lean, delicious, and a very easy snack.

Within a few minutes of trading I had basically the best items I'll ever find. It completely wiped out any interest in farming and getting rare loot because now that I'm trading, the game is just a constant farm for currency. Every item that drops will very likely not be of any use to me ever again.

The game pretty much ended for that standard character right there. There was nothing else to do but be a slave to the trading system.

I started a new character in SSF and now I feel the excitement again. I don't know what I'll find and I build my character around my drops and I gamble with what I find.

Trading ruins progression, as a game, you either have an auction house and trade and pretty much every char is on the same level, or you don't have an auction house and when people have amazing items and have progressed in the game it actually does give players a sense of ""Wow!"" because they've got some rare and interesting items that they found themselves.

That why I was asking, because I was legitimately curious, if they are charging us, are they going to be making any improvements to any of their infrastructure or just keep it as is? Cause at that point it seems kinda lame to have the exact same quality as the (previously) free version, but the only difference is cloud saves &amp; old NES games. The PSN improved dramatically after the release of PS+, so while it was a pain to go from free to paid, at leas the quality of service increased to justify the charge.

Hello everyone!
I'm a little confused on my first build.

I have a 570X case, with 6 LL120 fans and I'm using an h150i pro on the front. I've never done this before so please bear with me.

Ok, I installed the aio and replaced the stock fans on the front of the case with 3 of the LL fans. So now the fans need to hook up to the RGB hub and the CPU cooler, right? So I run the cables to the back of the case and hook them up with no issue. My issue comes to me in a few ways though. Fan 4, 5 and 6 also have two cable's connected to each fan, one goes to the RGB hub. But where does the other cable go? I don't know where they connect. I have seen many tutorials around the internet, but no one really says what to do or where to plug in the case fans...

Right, so if I set up the RGB to change color with the temps... will only the ones connected with the CPU cooler work?

I can post full specs if it's needed. But I don't really think it matters because this is about the case, cooler and fans.

Thanks for any help

The most important part is not getting injured. Running slow tends to lead to a more passive running form (longer ground contact and more time to let the contralateral hip drop and the knee to move in). Also by going slower and longer you need to maintain a good posture for longer in a more fatiqued state.

I generally advice starting with around 5/10 x 30/60 seconds run at a fast and ""supple"" pace so that when you finish you could do an extra interval with good technique. First progress by adding more intervals, then do some longer intervals up to 2-5mins and then start building up one long run a week that increases in distance. At the start you can alternate the running with walking to get more time on your feet and help prepare for longer runs.

I recently ran a 50km and still do mostly  intervals with one or two long runs a week and a tempo run maybe once every two months.

Mount skins cost ANet *more* to make than gliders did. Gliders seemed to largely be a model with simple ""Open or Closed"" functionality. Mount skins have a lot more to worry about. It's not just creating some new art then a new model and slapping it in the game. There is some testing and code that probably has to go in to make sure there are as few bugs as possible when releasing it.

It was capable of high altitude long duration missions, something no other plane could do.It was essentially a jet powered glider. The design was actually based off the F-104 with very narrow fuselage and skinny wings. It was not easy to fly. And, it is still in service, the current version is the U-2S. Other than the B-52 it is the only plane of the late 1950s - mid 1960s still in active service.

1574	I'm from Iowa. When this first came out, a handful of people I know shared this on Facebook about how excited and happy they are about it :(	"He bailed on the hike, but ""ghosted"" on the friendship. I'm using quotes because even though I know what phenomena I'm talking about, I'm suddenly very unsure if I've been using the right word to describe it this entire time. That said, in my experience, people generally don't appreciate it when people bail out or taper off friendships with no warning either. I've always been told that was inconsiderate and that the ideal response to not wanting to be around another person was being upfront and honest. 

It's unreasonable to actually expect ideal behavior from everyone all the time in practice, but we all have some idea what it's supposed to look like, so what's the harm in discussing whether or not that standard was met. That's what the gift of hindsight is for and for the most part, nobody hesitates to critique situations where women reject and/or disappoint men. It's happened in this thread a few times. 

People are willing to make excuses for the things this guy failed to do (ask about her relationship status, been upfront about his expectations instead of going silent, etc.) but not willing to do the same for OP who, at worst, didn't immediately see what was really going on. Once she did though, she acted in good faith, and I don't think she's been given enough credit for that. She could have bailed on him then but didn't. Instead, she chose to talk to him about it, and I think that was very mature. 

Actually, let's say that happened. OP realized that he thought this was a date, decided she didn't want to deal with potential drama, cancelled the hike, and then stopped talking to him without explanation. How does it compare to what actually happened? For instance, if what the guy did was a 3 on a 1-10 scale of general badness, what score would you give to someone who ended a relationship that way? 

If you think the score would be different, then I'd like to hear why since the only thing I can see that changed about the scenarios is who initiated the break in contact. Do you think she has an obligation to tell him that she ""figured it out"", or do you think bailing out or tapering off is really the ideal way to go about it? "	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	-1

Not all medications work for all people, and there are an increasing number of prescribers who will run a DNA panel to identify which medications are best matched for a person's particular chemical makeup. I have seen that make a significant difference. Also, the FDA requires clinical trials to show efficacy before they will allow a drug co to tout that X medication will do Y for you.

You’d tear him down and belittle him, so that he wouldn’t have the self-confidence to leave you. You need him to believe that nobody else will love him, that he’ll fail on his own.

Now pretend I'm omnipotent. I can just instantly whisk the mice away into a field someplace else instead of letting them get killed in my trap. If I don't, it doesn't matter *much*, since mice still are dumb and barely matter, but I'd be a better person if I did. 

If I want to be omnibenevolent, I always have to opt for the more moral choice. If God wants to get rid of the imperfections in his creation, he's omniscient, so he'd know not to create them in the first place, and he's omnipotent so he can easily fix them in a moral way. Instead, he just crudely kills people he's mad at. The whole ""firstborn son"" thing is morally deplorable considering he could easily gotten the Jews free another way.

I just don’t blame the employers. They can’t afford to eat much more of the costs. Big employers have tons of employees so eating more cost/employees erases profits and smaller employers just don’t have the funds to do that. I honestly believe they are doing the best they can to negotiate with insurance companies but insurance companies are coming back and saying this is what it costs. 

As for the cost shifting, we will always have that regardless the system unless we offer no protection and if you get sick you’re screwed which I think most people agree is generally not the best course. We do need a cultural shift health wise because you’re right, paying for a massive amount of preventable chronic illnesses would kill any healthcare system. 

Health insurance is a joke. It’s not a good system and probably never was. Covering Preexisting conditions goes against the ethos that is insurance and therefore has no place in healthcare. Single payer would be better but I’m with you when I don’t know the extent to how much better it would be.

Nobody said anything about developers not having the ability to sell additional content. 

Game expansions has been in games for decades. They are not generally seen as exploitative unless they're obvious low effort material.

You can play any of the Souls games games online without the feeling that the developer is taking advantage of addicts to ""maintain"" a game's online service. All of the DLC in the Souls games has been well done original work that actually added to the experience without taking anything away for the base game. 

Overwatch 35+ million copies. Do you really think that it literally needs exploitative monetization practices to stay afloat? 

Rocket League was making tons of money before they let their greed take over. 

I don't understand why people keep framing it as ""poor developers can't make games without loot boxes"" when it clearly has never been the case.

1638	I used to be able to do this in both ears but I got tinnitus in my left and it no longer rumbles. Worst part of the situation really.	"I believe billbucket is wrong in his claim and his sources do not match up to his claims of what they say. See below.

Also, to not just show why the answer is wrong, I want to provide a better answer.

When you hear high-pitched ringing in your ears it is because your inner ear usually is not receiving the high level of oxygen it needs from your blood supply. The brain is not receiving a signal, and so it interprets this as ringing instead. When the oxygen returns to normal levels, your ear works again, the brain receives the signal, and the ringing goes away.

Why does this happen spontaneously? We've probably all experienced this upon standing up too quickly. The blood pressure drops and we hear ringing in our ears, as the ear doesn't receive enough oxygen briefly.

This same situation can happen spontaneously within the ear itself.  If there is an extremely minor interruption in the blood flow to even a tiny area of the ear, this will occur. This can happen just from a variance in your blood oxygen saturation (it constantly varies in our blood from 90-100% normally) or from a brief narrowing of a blood vessel from movement or vasoconstriction (which is also constantly occuring).

Combining these effects you can get a very brief and very tiny transient ischemia (low oxygenated tissue) that your brain will interpret as ringing but very quickly clears itself since it is so small and eventually equalizes.

&gt; The paper billbucket linked to clearly indicates the sounds perceived from the tensor tympani is not high pitched (and you can experience it yourself by closing your eyes very tightly, hear that roar in your ears?) and would not be related to what the OP is talking about. This is unsubstantiated conjecture that doesn't make basic sense or have any evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; billbucket's top comment in this thread is not the answer, and has no evidence backing it up. The other link billbucket used to support his theory doesn't even mention the tensor tympani and simply talks about the relationship between brief tinnitus and chronic tinnitus.

"Agreed. The housing market crashed when we were just starting out. It was hard starting during the recession because no one was hiring. My husband had to do temp work with gaps between placements. I had a steady job at Starbucks, but I was a college graduate and couldn't find anything outside of customer service jobs that didn't require a degree. 

However, there was a lot of help with homes when we started out, too. They had a $10,000 home buyer's credit that you got if you bought a home and stayed in that home for at least 4 years. Prices were low, and interest rates were low. Actually, interest rates still are pretty low! Back when my parents were starting out, home interest rates were at 11%. Before the crash, rates were about 7%. The fact that you can get interest rates below 5% is still insane to me. 

Honestly, though, the way people are talking about homes reminds me of how people talked about homes before the bubble. Back then, in the early 2000s, everyone wanted to buy homes for investment properties. You can buy them and flip... that was the attitude at the time. The problem is, people bought homes, adjustable interest would go up, and they couldn't afford their homes. People stopped buying, and everyone went underwater in the homes they'd bought. I know a few people who literally had to declare bankruptcy over it, or were stuck in a starter home (like a condo) with an expanding family. 

So, I feel fortunate that we waited to buy until after the bubble burst. We bought a town home on short sale for a great deal, got a great rate, and got the $10k home buyer's credit.

1665	"It’s not true that you can’t do anything about this. It’s hard for girls to deal with stalkers and it’s probably harder for boys, but it doesn’t mean there’s nothing you can do. 

First of all, document everything. All the backlog of when you were together, all the messages she and her friends send you, screenshot the FB posts, and if she or anyone you know is associated with her (a “flying monkey”) calls you, tell them you are recording them (and do so). Document, document, document. 

Second, you need to talk to your HR department/your boss/school adviser/whoever is responsible for you professionally because she might start having an impact on your life plans with her slander. Tell them what’s happening, let them know you’re being harassed, and ask for resources from them in handling this — they’ll be equipped in your exact location. You may not want to do this because you don’t want to admit to your superiors that you’re having personal problems, but it would help with your feelings of security, and would nip any defamation in the bud if you’re worried about that. 

Third, report her to whatever platform she is using to create these public messages. If you’ve compiled enough evidence, also go to the local police department or call their non-emergency number and ask them what you can do about a stalker/harasser. If it’s just vague public Facebook posts there’s not much they can do, but if it’s direct messaging or calling you or your people, or showing up around you or your places, just to harass you, then you can apply for a Cease and Desist to be addressed to her (following this, a restraining order). Whatever the outcome with the police, ask them to write a formal record of your complaints (even if they can’t do anything) and get that paper trail. 

By the sounds of what you’re describing, it hasn’t really escalated outside of public Facebook posts, so there’s probably not going to be anything for the police to do. Your best resources are going to be reporting her to Facebook, as many times as necessary, and documentation. Block her and her friends if you need to protect your mental well-being. 

You should check out /JustNoSO for more help with this. They’re experts. 

Good luck friend. There are definitely things you can do to protect yourself, and it’s not because you’re a man that they won’t take you as seriously as you like.

1667	"Article states incorrectly. ""There is no magic bullet to remedy a problem as deep-rooted as America's inequality.""

My thoughts "" I have a been researching a magic price model that solves inequality while making a profit by letting sellers automatically price markup higher for rich people and lower to poor people for the same thing""  

First I have to explain the biggest invisible reason why economic inequality is increasing.  Any sale of a an asset with progressive value for a fixed price increases inequality.  Here's an example of an asset such as a toll bridge that provides an equal time value to everyone by saving 1 hour travel time vs driving around and not buying a ticket for the toll bridge.  The customer value for buying a ticket to cross the toll bridge is progressive because it saves time and time is worth more money for rich people than poor people.  For this example the regular price of the toll bridge is 5 dollars and the traffic to get on the toll bridge is 1/2 hour.  The savings to every customer who buys passage on the toll bridge is (1hour value - 1/2 traffic - $5) = 0.5hr - $5.  So a person profits 1/2 hour (0.5hr) but the cost is $5.  If a person makes $10/hr they have to work 1/2 hour to pay the toll and save 1/2 by taking the bridge and that person makes no profit.  BUT if a person makes $30/hr they have to work only 1/6 of an hour to pay the toll wich saves them 1/2 hour.  the profit to someone who makes $30/hr is $30/hr(1/2-1/6)=$10.  BUT if a person makes $100/hr they have to work only .05hr to pay for the toll and still save 0.5 hr for a profit of 0.45hr.  multiply thier time savings by their rate of $100/hr and that person profited $45 by taking the bridge.  So in conclusion, every sale or exchange of value using the same fixed $5 price for everyone will make the rich richer and the poor less rich.  This doesn't happen just with toll bridges, it happens with every consumer purchase in the marketplace and continually increases inequality.  

What can we do about inequality and how does the magic price formula work?  instead of charging $5 for the toll bridge, the price should be 1/2 hour for the toll bridge.  Each person gets their price calculated based on their individual $/hr rate.  So we charge each person a variable amount to cross the bridge based on their $/hr rate.  The rich people pay more and the poor people pay less and the toll bridge makes a profit and inequality decreases. Why not make 3 lanes of the toll bridge variable pricing.  One lane is prices at $25 to cross the toll bridge and it has a short line with no traffic time wait.  One lane is priced at $5 to cross the toll bridge and has an average line wait, but it only allows cars to go through it when the $25 priced toll bridge lane is empty.  The final lane is priced at $1 and is very slow during rush hours but just fine at off peak hours and nighttime.  The final lane, of course, only allows people through it at the $1 price if the other two more expensive lines are empty.  Using this pricing strategy, the rich save time and the poor save money and the toll bridge makes a lot more profit. 

this is just one part of a research project on the topic of profitable ways to reduce inequality.  You can find out more on my personal site where I explain these concepts using pictures and slideshow and videos for easier reading at https://sites.google.com/view/the-hoep-project/home"	"&gt;The problem being that it is easier for those with more capital to increase their wealth than those with less capital.

1674	Hello guys, just purchased a refurbished canon camera a week or so ago. It came to me with a shutter count around 1600. In light of full disclosure, I purchased a yongo lens 50mm 1.8 that I’ve been using for the past few days. I also purchased some extension tubes to take macro shots.(non canon) All was going great prior to today. And today my camera just kind of turned off, so I presumed that was because I used the battery for too long and it died. However, I don’t remember ever seeing a low battery sign. I charged the battery and put it back into the camera . When it turned on  I got ERROR-20. The shutter wouldn’t move at all and the camera looked dead except it was showing the error on the top screen.  After looking things up it seems like it could be a mechanical problem. One of the solutions I found was to take out he battery and put it back in. So I did that and the camera turned right back on with no problems. Now I am concerned because I don’t want to end up dealing with a broken camera in the future. Could this error be caused by the extension tubes not communicating with the lens properly? Or is it likely something unrelated to the lens or the extension tubes and I should return the camera to canon? I still have a few days to return it back to canon for a refund and get myself a new camera.  Thanks in advance for the help. 	Currently laughing at this. It's the opposite, actually. A zoom lens is for convenience, where as a prime involves more thought- where you want to be, how you want to compose the shot, and so on.

1678	"&gt;While it is implied that Boruto is hiding the device and his use of it I don't see any reason why he would or should think it's use would be prohibited.

Because Chuunin exams are about testing the individual's ability to lead and handle missions, the Kote uses someone elses ability for jutsu.

&gt;Without a specific point being made that they are prohibited, outside of that one private meeting in the Hokage office, why would any contestant think using something like that would be any different than using something like the knives that enhance lighting Chakra

The chakra knives still require your own chakra to use, the Kote uses someone else's for the jutsu. Using the knives also requires some control, we see from Naruto that his initial attempt with the knives is much less refined than Asuma. The Kote will always yield a perfect jutsu based on whatever was put in.

&gt;or why would it be expected that a Ninja would give up or disclose some secret tool they have procured ahead of competition?

Because no other tool uses someone elses chakra to drive the jutsu. 

&gt;It seems like there is a massive consensus its wrong/cheating but I honestly don't see how/why, let alone why he wound think so without accepting that there was some unshown scene where they announced they were prohibited. 

I figure it's like a race, and ninja tools like shuriken are just the shoes or whatever you're wearing, no matter how good they are, you are still limited by your own ability.

Then some cunt comes along driving a car, he's not using his own energy to run, and whatever 'skill' is required to drive the car is vastly outweighed by the fact the car is doing all the work.

I wanted to make this post because I see a train wreck happening in the near future. And it isn't going to end well.

The summary of the situation is that my mother wants me to prioritize her over my girlfriend and I want to split the time equally, but she doesn't agree and wants me to break up with my girlfriend so that I can spend more time with her.

However, breaking up for no reason other than my mom wanting us to break up would make me miserable as my girlfriend and I have a steady relationship. My girlfriend knows about my mom trying to break us apart (bad mistake on my part letting her know) and also wants me to see my mom less often in order to spite her.

My original plan would be for me to split time with my mom and girlfriend, seeing my mom during the days and spending the nights with my girlfriend. But now my mom wants me to spend the night at my parents house (even though I already promised my girlfriend I would come home tonight)

I think the root cause of this is my mom feels insecure because she has many friends that were abandoned by their children, and had to take care of themselves even in their old age. I need to find some way to reassure her this will not be the case and that I will continue to take care of my parents, but it would have to involve compromise because my time/resources would be stretched thin if I had to spend all of my time with my mom/dad AND my future family.

Likewise, I think the root cause of my girlfriend wanting to spite my mom is that she will never feel comfortable if her mother in law is constantly trying to take her son away from her and taking away time/energy from our future family.

**TL;DR** My mom doesn't like my girlfriend and my girlfriend doesn't like my mom because they each want to spend more time with me

What should I say to my mother and my girlfriend that would enable them to see eye to eye, or at least accept some form of compromise?

Static stretching BEFORE the activity [reduces](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/777155) performance.

I'm a physio student, and the only purpose of stretching a muscle is to increase it's length, this is only needed if it's shortened, and even then, it's really really hard to increase the length of a muscle with just stretching.

If you have a shortened pectoralis minor/major, static stretching won't do shit if you still bench press in a non- full ROM fashion.

If you workout, and you do every movement in it's full range of motion, and work the agonist/antagonist with the same ratio (assuming you never had imbalances before you started working out) there would ideally be no need to stretch at all. 

DYNAMIC warm ups are a different story, and should be incorporated."	"If you're doing static stretches (the traditional runners stretch hold for 10 seconds kind of thing) I would not do that before running. 

Add a dynamic warm up. You can find a million online. Pickup some activities that are similar to the exercise you're going to perform.

"Just as an example, gold could be used instead of copper for a lot (more) of electronics and electric cables, since it's properties for e.g. conduction of electricity are much better. If gold would be cheap, a whole new market for it would appear. 

The same is true for a lot of elements. Platinum (catalysator for tons of chemical reactions), rare earth elements (photovoltaics and electric motors/generators) and so on. Additionally, in the near future we will run out of a lot of stuff that is already unreplaceable in industry like helium, indium and rhenium. Keep in mind all the platinum we ever mined in history could fit into one big living room. Thats how scarce it is. All the gold ever mined would only fill 2 olympic swimming pools. Hell, we already! effectively ran out of some exotic elements needed for ultra-high efficiency photovoltaics... so we can not produce them due to shortage of those elements and hence costs.

For instance, we've been making sub 10nm transistors for at least 15 years, but only recently have chips using 10nm transistors been possible to manufacture. 

Reliability is the most difficult and important part of manufacturing, because in order to get a part that does anything but sit there looking pretty, you need *billions* of transistors, and the overwhelming majority of them need to work. You need to be *certain* that when you pattern a wafer that contains what will hopefully turn into 500 processors, each of them containing a billion transistors, that you're not going to mess up any more than *maybe* a few dozen transistors across the whole wafer--otherwise the price of all of those other processors increases to the point where it's cheaper to buy several last-gen processors and get roughly the same performance."	science	science	-1

&gt;  However, if people want to suggest we make sweeping decisions which affect people's lives based on the supposition that like, maybe women didn't evolve to be good at computers, then there absolutely will be strong disagreement. 

But come on, this is a total straw man. It's absurd on it's face, nobody evolved to be good at computers because computers didn't exist while we were doing 99.9999999% of our evolution (please don't fact check the number of 9's!). That's not what this guy said, I don't think it's what Damore said either (although I don't remember, and I don't agree with some of what he said, but by all means if you have a quote where he thinks he's saying it, I'd be curious to see it).

&gt; In the absence of evidence suggesting otherwise we probably should assume that men and women are similar, because they are in most ways. 

I don't really agree that it's a reasonable default, that until we prove that e.g. the gap in software engineering gender ratios is caused by biology, we should assume that it is 100% cultural discriminatory. I think (personally) a more reasonable assumption is that it is almost certainly some fraction biological, and some fraction cultural, and the two are not even very easy to separate (and also, I do agree it's unlikely that the status quo is ""biologically correct"", since it's obvious that women still experience discrimination, less encouragement, etc, no argument).

I definitely think it's highly problematic to look at disparate outcomes, and simply assume that it's based on disparate treatment, disparate culture, and take extreme actions (for whatever definition of extreme) to correct that. We should treat legitimate, individual reports of sexism with the gravity they deserve (a lot). But, this is very different than an attitude that says that until 50% of engineers are women, some injustice is being perpetrated on women. Injustice and discrimination are wrong regardless of whether you get the outcomes you want, and (I believe) that if injustice and discrimination are absent then the outcome for the most part should be ok regardless of what it is."

1782	"As an adult who has been diagnosed with ADHD for many years, and as a teacher who has observed many children who have been both recently diagnosed with ADHD and diagnosed for years, I have to disagree with you.

Firstly, not everyone struggles with ADHD to the same degree. It's far worse for some people than others. In my experience I've started working on coping strategies with some students and they've seen huge growth in just a few weeks - others took months, some were catching on in just a few days. You don't have to understand your diagnosis to do things differently, though. 

When I was a kid I was undiagnosed, but as an adult, having done my reading, I realized that I had been developing coping strategies on my own. I noticed that some things worked to help me learn and complete tasks and other things didn't work, so I kept doing the things that worked. It didn't take any knowledge about ADHD, that's just what we do as humans when we're frustrated about the way we perform in some way - we adapt. My adaptations allowed me to get good grades and succeed, but once I was diagnosed with ADHD and started medication, I found that I could do so much more with so much less effort, and my coping strategies needed to be adapted, but helped me to be very successful. No more grading papers in the closet.

Now, some people don't make those adaptations on their own, and they need help from professionals, but it doesn't always take decades, I would be amazed if it actually took decades for anyone to see improvement. 

We develop coping strategies for every situation we're in, I think that it's very likely that kids with ADHD who are introduced to the structured school setting where they're expected to shift gears from just playing to playing to learn and learning to learn WILL develop coping strategies, and if they aren't developmentally ready to make GOOD coping strategies, they'll make bad ones. 

Some people cope with ADHD by giving up when something is hard. That's a bad coping strategy. There are many others that someone can develop, that they're likely to develop if they start school when they aren't ready."	"What is ""that"" exactly?

Sure, so we'll call that a wash. Like I said, either way likeability doesn't necessarily determine alliances. Self-interest does. I'm sure the foreign governments wouldn't mind cooperating with Eldian devils in exchange for peace and security. 

&gt;The Survey Corps faced only a handful of soldiers and the remaining shifters Marley had. Not to mention that the SC also had the element of surprise with them. An empire as massive as the Marleyan empire would have a standing army far larger than what the SC faced.

They've incapacitated Cart Titan, and snatched the Warhammer Titan. The allegiances of Zeke and Reiner to Marley are tenuous at best, if the theories around Zeke are correct. The Survey Corps are well-suited to guerrilla warfare, and they also have a natural advantage in cities because of tall buildings serving as anchor points for their 3-D maneuvering technology. This, in turn, leaves open the possibility for future surprise terrorist attacks against Marley. Paradis only needs to fight a defensive war against Marley to secure their interests, and history is full of examples of smaller local fighting units excelling against larger empires at wars of attrition. 

&gt;One could also argue that the other nations would want to attack Paradis to take down the Founding Titan, and nullify the advantage the wall titans would give.

Sure, if that's a risk they're willing to take. But such an operation would be costly in terms of lives, resources, and manpower, and even then Eren would still have the threat of the Wall Titans hanging against their heads.

1791	"&gt; This ""reality"" isn't a reality at all, it's your own projection of what you believe to be true. What's ACTUALLY true here is that those games would still exist regardless because if it will bring in money, someone will fund it to get their return back.

I'm not sure if what you're saying is true either. Let's start from a point I'm sure we can all agree on:

Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo want to make money. So do EA, Ubisoft, Sega, and other third parties.

The console makers get money from the fees they take from publishers releasing games on their consoles, PSN purchases, the accessories they sell (e.g. controllers), selling consoles (later in the console lifestyle), and from the revenue that their own games generate.

The third parties get money from the revenue that the games they develop/publish generate, including microtransactions and season passes. This also includes revenue from Origin/UPlay sales since those games are developed/published by EA/Ubisoft anyway.

There's a major difference in the way these companies get money. The third parties get most of their revenue from games, but the revenue that Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo receive is much more varied. 

Therefore, games released by a third party must be profitable because otherwise the third party would bankrupt itself. There can be exceptions - perhaps by releasing an unprofitable game that becomes GOAT, the company's reputation skyrockets and that unprofitable game ends up helping in the long run - but generally speaking the third parties' games must be profitable.

Obviously, Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo also want their games to be profitable. However, because their sources of revenue are more varied, they *can* afford to take more risks, resulting in the first party developers receiving more creative freedom and larger budgets. Does this actually happen? I would say yes. For example, Shenmue was so expensive to develop that every Dreamcast owner would have to buy the game twice in order for the game to turn a profit. As you mentioned already, many PlayStation games like Quantic Dream's titles, Team Ico's titles, and Media Molecule's titles are pretty niche.

Therefore, I think those first party exclusives might exist, but in a different shape or form because of the limitations that developers could possibly face because they're a third party studio."

1802	"Hey, thanks for the thoughtful reply! I can definitely see some of the benefits of those features.

&gt;    First off, the status bar doesn’t show notification icons like Android, so even without opening the notification center, on Android you already know what notifications you have.

Personally, i could never stand those icons in the status bar; makes things look very cluttered to me. But I could see how others would find them useful. (I’d argue that the equivalent on iOS is app icon badges.)

&gt;    Second, the whole behavior where after you get a notification and unlock/use the phone without taking action on the notification, it’s hidden. This makes it really hard to forget about notifications.

This is interesting to me. Are you saying that all notifications are always visible persistently on the Android lock screen? Or only certain ones?

In iOS, when you get a notification on the lock screen and unlock the phone without taking action on it, it goes to the Notification Center (accessed when the phone is unlocked by swiping down from the top, or if on the lock screen again, by swiping up to see more of the older notifications).

One exception to this I know of is notifications from the Reminders app; those stay persistently on both the lock screen and Notification Center.

&gt;    the notification center on Android feels a lot more rich and actionable (i know you can expand on iOS)

Can you elaborate on this? I find 3D touching notifications in iOS to offer pretty rich previews and actions. Are there specific examples you find better on Android?

&gt;    You have much more granular control over the types of notifications each app can send you

I have seen Android notification channels, that is pretty nice. It would be great to see iOS adopt this feature at the OS level, but in iOS 12 it can link you from an app’s notification (or notifications settings page) to the equivalent granular settings page within the app itself to configure which types of notifications you do and don’t want to receive.

"With the recent announcement of more than $100-million in new tax reassessments it’s clear the federal government remains intensely interested in catching real estate flippers in Toronto and Vancouver. And some tax professionals and real estate insiders believe this is merely the beginning as the Canada Revenue Agency targets players in the property market who may have been cheating on their taxes for years.

“I know lots of guys – some of the things they’ve done I can’t believe,” says Jamie Johnston, broker of record for Re/Max Condos Plus Corp. in Toronto. “They measure risk and reward, and that’s why they cheat.”

It is extremely rare for Canadians to be convicted or sent to jail in tax evasion: for example there are about 29 million tax filings annually in Canada and there were 37 convictions between April, 2016 and March, 2017; that’s about 0.0001 per cent. It’s a little less rare in the United States, where the Internal Revenue Service that sees about 151 million filings a year and had 2,672 convictions in 2016 (0.001 per cent). “In Canada you never go to jail, so the rewards are high and the risks are small. I think there’s a systemic problem, a whole bunch of people are not paying,” Mr. Johnston says.

But in the past two years the CRA has been sending a different signal: We are paying attention and the monetary risks are real.

Last week, CRA issued a release that summarized its recent enforcement efforts. Since 2015, $592-million in additional taxes related to real estate have been discovered, in the most recent year alone another $102.6-million was reassessed and $19.2-million in penalties for false claims have been levied (since 2015 it has levied $43.7-million in penalties). The government is now reviewing about 10,000 real estate-related cases a year and it can take its time to find cheaters: it can review a filing for up to four years after it is submitted.

“While the Canada Revenue Agency has always had a presence in the real estate sector, we have increased the focus on the sector to address growing concerns of non-compliance,” says Jeremy Ghio, press secretary for the office of Minister of National Revenue, Diane Lebouthillier. “Over the last few years, the economic factors in the Greater Toronto Area and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, such as high-valued markets combined with rapid price increases, have further increased the risk of tax non-compliance in the real estate sector. ”

In a previous era of lax enforcement, some condo and detached home flippers have been able to own multiple properties and sell them off without declaring all the eligible taxes. Now, many are discovering the CRA has some very powerful tools in its enforcement box. The CRA can follow land registry and other data sources, locate suspicious looking transactions that went unrecorded or under-reported on tax filings and then file a reassessment. If disputed, the CRA can compel developers, utilities, banks and telecom providers to hand over data about a home that is under suspicion.

“You’re guilty till your proven innocent; that’s how the CRA’s model works,” says Justin Kutyan, a partner and tax litigator with KPMG Law LLP, an arm of accountancy giant KPMG in Canada. “ Even in tax court, the onus is on taxpayers to disprove the Minister’s assumption of fact. Our tax system is based on a self-reporting system – it’s based upon honesty and integrity – and they have a lot of tools to double-check that you’re honest. It becomes difficult, especially when they have the objective evidence: you barely showed up to the condo ever, you never swiped your card, you don’t buy hydro, your mail’s not forwarded there, Rogers has you listed at another house.”

One area the CRA has turned its attention to is filers who improperly claimed a GST rebate for a new or substantially renovated home. Even though the maximum rebate is $24,000 it’s only eligible for a primary residence and falsifying this can be a clue of other activity.

“On GST, they are just crazy at CRA. They are going after it hard,” says Mr. Kutyan, who is a long-time tax litigator and who previously argued cases for the CRA before switching to the defence team with white-shoe law firm Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP, and now KPMG. “I think those are creating leads on the income tax side.”

Take the example of Gideon Margolin, a real estate broker who recently lost an appeal on a GST case involving the 2012 purchase (and 2014 sale) of a new-construction house at 116 Riding Mountain Dr. in Richmond Hill, Ont. Mr. Margolin declined to comment on his case when reached by The Globe and Mail, but the court documents fill in some of the details. Justice Randall Bocock’s ruling at the Tax Court of Canada found Mr. Margolin and his spouse, “did not intend to occupy it as their primary residence … [and] neither of them actually used the … property as their primary place of residence.”

The Crown introduced into evidence readings from the gas and electricity meters that effectively showed little consumption of those utilities in the five months between when the house was completed by the builder and when Mr. Margolin sold it. Mr. Margolin had several properties that he shuttled between, but movers and his cleaning lady testified that he essentially used Mountain Drive as a storage locker.

He also did not disclose that he bought and sold another new-construction house in Vaughan, Ont. referred to as “Lynvest” in the ruling, until asked by the Crown lawyers during the trial. “The Lynvest property was closed only 45 days before the acquisition of [116 Riding Mountain] and Lynvest was sold mere days before [116 Riding Mountain] was acquired, all escaping Mr. Margolin’s initial recall,” Justice Bocock wrote. The ruling notes that those other houses are not part of this case, even though Mr. Margolin told the court he was seeking to avoid “trouble” on them.

During all this time, and to this day, it appears Mr. Margolin primarily lived in a $2-million house on an 11-acre lot in King City, Ont.

These $24,000 GST rebates seem like small potatoes for the government, but once proved, they become the thin edge of the wedge to pry open and reassess the tax status of those flipped properties.

Most homeowners are aware that if they sell a newly purchased primary residence within one year they might be subject to capital gains taxes on 50 per cent of any profit they make on the sale. But if the CRA finds that the owner to be a habitual flipper, who doesn’t live in the homes and that they are bought and sold as an occupation, they will assess those proceeds as business income and apply a tax rate to 100 per cent of the profits on any property. Not to mention, if tax filings are incorrect, the government can assign penalties – with interest compounded monthly – that back-date to the time of the original incorrect filing.

That’s why Mr. Kutyan is seeing a lot more home flippers coming to him for legal advice and representation.

“We’ve been successful for some of these flippers to somehow at least get the penalties dropped and at least get a capital gains treatment,” he says. His advice for flippers is to plan ahead and budget to pay your taxes. “What’s that saying? ‘Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered?’”"	canada	canada	-1

"&gt; If this was oldschool MC days? You have one shot per week. It was highly doubtful you'd even get 1 item per week. You might not get an upgrade for months. You couldn't even trade loot back then. The best gear was in raids and raids only.

What I'm saying, though, is that for me, I **preferred this system**. I like logging in for my raid nights, killing the bosses with my friends, and slowly but surely gearing up. Sure, I might not get all the best upgrades for months, but I preferred this set progression of gearing up. Also, small point, but worth saying: the not trading gear thing is completely irrelevant in a world of master looter with fair and proper loot distribution, which my guilds always were.

By the time you finish up with that tier, most people have all the gear they need and you move on to the next. By the final tier, everyone gets to start chasing their absolute BiS.

This where we're differing in our preferences on gear acquisition. I come from a mindset where I shouldn't need 12 hrs a day of game time to chase the gear I want.

What we have now is a never-ending carrot on an extremely long stick. I don't like that I log in and know there's 20 different places I could be chasing gear at any given moment.

Also I think there can be more then faith for religious people. Personal experiences that happen to them for example. I haven't mentioned these though b/c once again that would be anecdotal ""evidence"" and kind of impossible to prove one way or the other. The feelings one experiences during these though are real.

I'll give you a personal example I experienced and note I'm not talking about seeing things that could possibly be a mental health problem but feeling things on an emotional level.

When I was younger I got involved with drugs. I got a hold of some bad stuff once. Fairly soon after doing it I could tell something was wrong and two of my friends there knew it as well. On top of the physical problems I was mentally a wreck and experienced the worst anxiety attack of my life. I just knew I was going to die. So EMS was called and I can remember being scared to death in the back. I prayed to God out loud in the EMS to please take away this feeling and that I'd promise him I'd never touch that stuff again. I immediately felt a complete sense of calmness when I finished. I mean it was a drastic and sudden turn around in the entire way I felt emotionally. 

Now I can't tell you that was God with 100% certainty. Some would say it was just science and endorphins or what have you. For me though my faith combined with the feelings I experienced there helped to solidify my belief.  

Please understand as well that I fully accept the fact that other people from other religious beliefs have had these same types of encounters. Obviously if it happens to come from a religion that runs completely counter to Christianity they can't both be true.

In short all of this is simply saying I can't with an honest face tell you the true ""why"" as to why I believe. I'm not sure it's even possible. Some people simply believe and have faith while others do not. Personally I see no problem with this as long as those that believe don't try and shove those beliefs onto people who simply don't. On the flip side I feel like people who simply don't believe shouldn't try and shove that onto people who do."	"&gt; Other penalties are used for accidental killings, not a life for a life.

1829	"Hi!

Last October, I purchased an MSI gaming laptop. The product number is GS73VR 7RG-027NE, so I believe it is [this model](https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GS73VR-7RG-Stealth-Pro).

At the same time, I bought two HyperX Impact DDR4 2400MHz 16GB SODIMM RAM chips. The laptop itself had 16GB RAM, but supported 32GB, and I wanted to upgrade. So immediately after I got the laptop and the two 16GB chips, I took out the native chips and inserted the two 16GB ones (actually I had this done at a PC service place, as I did not have the equipment to open up the laptop).

Now, I don't even know if the RAM is related to this, but shortly after I started using the laptop (perhaps a couple of weeks), it started crashing (BSOD). With time, the crashes became increasingly frequent. They often happened when I booted the PC from sleep mode, and then eventually *always* after playing video games for a while (specifically I played a lot of PUBG and StarCraft II, and the problem was especially bad with PUBG, but it would happen with any game). However, the PC could crash at any time, for instance if I was typing in Word.

I delivered the laptop back to where I bought it, and they tried to fix it. They said the problem was that the motherboard was defect, and had swapped it with a new one. When I got the PC back, it worked just as new. But after perhaps just one week, the crashes started happening again. Again it's getting worse and worse.

So now I am wondering what the problem might be. I did a RAM test with MemTest86 a while ago and did not find any errors with the RAM. Still, I am particularly worried that there might be something wrong with the RAM, as I fear the warranty will be void if I send it back and they find out it's the RAM that's frying the motherboard.

So, anybody got any suggestions? Is this the RAM or something else? Why did the problem get fixed when they swapped the motherboard, but then keeps coming back afterwards?"	"Did you have any tracking software installed on it beforehand?

1848	"My current line of thinking is that the Jesus of the bible was really a pastiche of many different stories, which probably came from several different groups, maybe talked about different people at first.

That is not a statement about whether or not an actual Jesus from Nazareth or Bethlehem existed, walked around, preached the imminent apocalypse or was crucified. That may have been one of those stories. Maybe one of the more important ones.

Or not.

I'm quite certain that hallucinations played an important role. Paul himself declared that he received his gospel in a vision, and so did others. And Paul is the first writer of the New Testament.

A lot of the NT is a rewrite of other stories, mostly from the OT, but also from greek sources.

I think the advantage of this theory, which I mostly gleaned from Robert M Price, is that it can easily explain many phenomena, for example:

* Jesus is a descendent of David once, but then denies that the Messiah is of the house of David
* Jesus is compared to Moses and Elijah in Galilee instead
* Many sayings of Jesus seem distinctly Cynic
* Some parts of the gospels seem quite Gnostic
* The discussions with lurking Pharisees are awkward, because Jesus seems to hold positions that are perfectly acceptible in rabbinic thought at the time, and ""the Pharisees"" were not a group of one, and only one opinion
* Dying and rising gods and their associated mystery cults were quite in fashion at the time, and Christianity seems to have a big dash of that flair
* There are lots of anachronisms - Pharisees in synagogues in Galilee being only one of many
* In stories like the plucking of the wheat on the sabbath, the Pharisees accuse the disciples, not Jesus himself, which seems fairly odd at first glance, but is easily explained if the writer was preaching to his own community ca 70-100AD.

There are lots and lots of other arguments. I can't possibly write them all down here, even just the ones I know off the top of my head.

If you are now itching to tell me that all of this can be explained in the more mainstream fashion - sure, it can. I find the above explanation more compelling."

1855	"In terms of finding new games, here's something I do when looking through a *really* oversaturated market like the app store or steam:

- Think about some general concept that you feel like playing a game about. Like ""zombie shooter"" or ""wolf"" or ""golf"".

- Search that term in the store and *trawl*. You learn pretty quick how to identify crap asset flips and such from the app icon/screenshots/name. Only click on something that looks like a real game.

I've found some hidden gems from doing that. The really good games generally get passed around word-of-mouth, but I also like interesting and weird games and I certainly find a lot doing this. It's actually much easier to do on Steam than the iOS/android appstore, if you think Steam is oversaturated then you're in for a rude awakening if you ever try trawling the appstore.

As for determining whether a game is worth it, I look at two things: a general consensus from many reviews from different sources and gameplay footage.

I don't usually trust professional game review websites, I prefer jumping on forums and reading reader reviews/first impressions of normal gamers, and always read widely so you don't get too biased from one source. That and you usually can tell how a game plays just from watching it being played, so uncommentated raw gameplay videos on youtube are my preferred method of determining a game's quality."

1859	I will try to reply to your points in order, thank you for replying, you have a well thought out point of view. Yes birth control fails, but that does not grant the authority to end a unique life to the victim of the failure. There is one birth control method that works with complete success: abstinence. Sex is always going to run the risk of pregnancy and a life should not be ended when the risk becomes the reality and that isn’t what a woman or couple wanted. There is no risk if there is no sex. (I am not religious and this doesn’t come from any moral place, it’s just a fact). There are massive effects to a woman’s body, but they are not the same as the effects to a life when it is completely ended, (and in life-threatening cases I believe that the woman’s actually life or death situation takes precedence). I do not believe men should be able to “skip town”, neither does the American legal system, which compels proven fathers to at least pay child support, which I think should be more severe. Even at the extremely early stage when a fetus is only a cluster of cells it is still genetically unique from the mother, and within 6-8 weeks will have its own independent heart beat, blood type, and brain activity. That seems like a very simple standard for a human life, because if someone only had those descriptors they would most likely summarize from them that the subject is independent. And I am not remotely religious, I just value life.	I'm from Iowa.

All the speculations at the end are pure FUD:

- We don't know if there will be any regulation, but I'd say it's unlikely because hubs/relays never have control over the funds or knowledge about where a payment is coming from or going to. Also, Bitcoin doesn't have any borders, so you can always use a hub in a country without  regulation.
* We don't even know if hubs will be a thing at all, because they'd need to put large amounts of money into online hot-wallets, and that gets riskier the bigger they are.
* You don't need large channels if you make sure your channels balance out by routing tx in both directions.
* It's an open ecosystem, so anybody who charges unreasonable fees will be pushed out of the market.
* There can be multiple logical and interconnected networks with different topologies (hub-and-spoke, mesh, whatever) on the same LN. Wallets (you!) decide where to connect to and who to route through, so you are free to use or not use hubs, should they emerge.
* A 3rd party monitoring a channel for you knows nothing about that channel other than some keys that can be used to punish a bad actor, but for nothing else.

I strongly agree with the belief that what’s in the past is in the past and it’s irrelevant to your present relationship.

And, quite frankly, I don’t feel particularly sorry for you. In your original post, you said:

&gt; Something similar happened previously where I didn't tell the truth about something that happened I a previous relationship and she asked me again and I told her the truth.

Why is it so hard for you to either a) tell your SO that you aren’t going to divulge your history, or b) to be completely honest when you do? I wouldn’t put up with a significant other who only told the truth when it’s convenient to him because that’s shitty. 

Yes, it was a kiss, and in the grand scheme of things — whatever. It’s not a big deal.

I think long term harvesting from sewage will net more than storm water, particularly if we continue to increase population, and therefore domestic water usage. I'm no expert though.

But I was like ""I got a question for you though, you're Vince Staples right?"" and he said yeah and oh boy I haven't fanboyed out in a minute and I was wilding, told him I fucking loved BFT and Summertime 06 and he's one of my favorite rappers and I'm a huge fan all that shit.

1884	"I'm not the person to whom you're replying, but I'd like to chime in here. In economics, we use two different terms to discuss these things – ""statistical significance"" is very different from ""economic significance"". If I'm researching the impacts of a new law has on companies' dividend payments, I could get a very statistically significant coefficient estimate indicating a 0.001% increase in dividend payments from the law. While I may be pretty certain that that effect exists, it doesn't really have any sort of ""actual"" impact on things in a realistic sense. The new law doesn't really matter (at least for dividend payments) from a practical standpoint. 

In this scenario, the statistical significance I'm discussing is all related to the p-value. The reason we care about that is because we want to be certain that the effect we're looking for actually exists. With an r-squared of 0.13, saying that 13% of the variation is explained by the estimation equation, that's not telling us how confident we can be that our independent variable of interest has an effect. The p-value for that estimate tells us this – the statistical significance of our (potential) effect. Once we've established that the p-value gives us enough confidence in our coefficient estimate, then we can directly interpret that coefficient estimate as the magnitude of that effect. That gives us the economic significance. The r-squared doesn't really directly tell us either of these, which is why r-squared isn't directly used much in this type of analysis. "	"If you don't count sleeping and chores, sure. But assuming you also sleep 8 hours a day that's 56 hours gone, so 96. Commute which can take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes, maybe even an hour.

1889	One thing I like about striker fired is the lack of an exposed hammer. Do you carry cocked? If so, are you concerned about lint or any other debris getting in there? 	"&gt; I don't think arguing about fictional fines needed to own a gun really negates my points.

Well, it is a straw man to suggest the abuse of power by those who determine who gets the privilege or not is inevitable. But it is clearly a side effect that becomes possible if we reduce firearm ownership from a right to a privilege. 

It is strange to me that so many people (not necessarily you) want to surrender their rights to a government who's elected officials accept large sums of money form companies and individuals and are occasionally forced to resign because they abused their position of power for sexual exploits. And then allow only the police to possess firearms when they protest the police for believing them to being corrupt or abusing their power.

As far as solving the issue of violence in our country I do not think this is something that can be solved by more legislation. Turning law abiding individuals into criminals because they possess an item which has the potential to harm someone at some time in the future is not an effective solution or we would have banned private ownership of vehicles long ago. If anything I think we should simplify gun laws, get rid of all the gray areas and victimless crimes such as set up national reciprocity, deregulate silencers, sbrs, and sbss, eliminate gun free zones, eliminate laws that prohibit the possession of ""high"" cap mags in states that restrict that, etc. If we simplify the laws though we need to maximize the punishment of criminal offenders. People who use guns for violent crimes should receive maximum sentences. Using a gun during the facilitation of a felony should add 20+ years to your prison time for the original felony, lets make the people who use guns for bad things realize this could cost them their freedom for life not just 3-8 years.

We took the approach of outlawing possession in the war against drugs and it has been a disaster. Some argue it created a market in which gangs kill each other to claim territory for which to sell their illegal product. Opiod overdose [killed more people than all firearms](https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates) (including suicides) in 2016 (projections for 2017 were just as high but I haven't seen any official statistic released). Gun ownership is at an all time high and the homicide rate is the lowest it has been since the 1960's.

I believe that stopping violence requires a cultural change by everyone in society. I believe we all need to hold ourselves more accountable for our actions, especially parents of their kids. The amount of times a child under 12 tells an adult in public to ""go fuck yourself"" is too high. We also need to live our lives to the higher standard we are holding our kids to or they won't live to that higher standard if nobody is watching. So gone are the days of telling someone who cut you off in traffic to ""go fuck yourself"", the kids are listening and they noticed. There need to be real life consequences for decisions that people make. No more 3 months of jail time for raping a passed out woman behind a dumpster, No more letting under 18 kids break the law over and over to only get a slap on the wrist, threats made online through social media need to be followed up with real life consequences. Teachers need to let parents know when their kids are bullying or being victimized by bullying and the parents need to actually care. 

Even if we did all of these things it would still not eliminate all violence, but I think it would help and the only side effect would be a more polite society. But most people calling for gun control do not like these suggestions because it requires them to be nicer to their neighbors, discipline their kids, suppress road rage, and confront their own behavioral problems. For the majority of them, it is just easier to scream at law makers to ""do something"" instead of doing something themselves."	guns	guns	-1

"**EDIT: I posted this comment [as a new text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/832rn6/libertarian_thoughts_on_wealth_inequality_in/) just in case anyone wants to continue the discussion or add thoughts.**

To any LateStageCapitalism folks who might have stumbled over here, let me respond sincerely:

In every major civilization, from Ancient Mesopotamia to now, wealth has been concentrated in the hands of an elite few. Before you blame capitalism on all the woes in society, you have to show a time and place where that *hasn't* been the case. What economic system produces a *preferable* distribution of wealth?

It's certainly not any system based on Marx, Engles, Lenin, or any of the other ""intro"" socialist works your sub recommends. Regardless of how they labeled themselves (socialist, communist, ""People's Republics"", etc.), *every single country* that attempted to implement Marxist economic theory has had *horrendous* wealth inequality. High-ranking party members and their well-connected supporters lived **far** better lives than the average citizens. I can prove it: Name a single prominent, important Communist politician who starved to death during the *Holodomor* in Ukraine or the ""Great Leap Forward"" in China. Furthermore, Venezuela and North Korea are both experiencing severe food shortages, but they're both run by fat-fucks like [Nicolas Maduro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro_in_meeting_with_Iranian_President_Hassan_Rouhani_in_Saadabad_Palace.jpg) and [Kim Jong-Un](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kim_Jong-un_at_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea_main_building.png). I guess some are just more equal than others?

And before anyone plays the well-worn ""It wasn't real socialism"" card, I'd point out that they certainly thought it was at the time. Plus, if every time they try to implement it, they don't wind up implementing it, that seems like strong evidence that it doesn't work. ""Equality of Outcome"" is an impossible standard and should *not* be the goal of society. Every time it has been attempted, it has ended in catastrophe.

Now, you might point to the Nordic countries or some other places in Western Europe as example of preferable economies. I think there's a strong argument for that, and there are a lot of interesting discussions to be had there. However, you should still recognize that these are *capitalist* economies that all rank *very* highly on various indexes of economic freedom. There might be *less* inequality than the U.S., but it's nowhere near *zero*. There are still rich and poor, although the poor happen to be doing fairly well. That's in part because they have a fairly robust, well-designed safety net. You could argue about the benefits of their system, but make no mistake: these are very wealthy countries because of capitalism. It's because they allow individuals to control their own money/property and engage in voluntary exchanges of goods and services.

This also explains why wealth has *exploded* in formerly-Marxist countries after they liberalize the economy. *Billions* of people have been vaulted out of absolute poverty in the last few decades. If you want to have rising standards of living for the average citizens, you *must* have a market-based economy. The evidence is *overwhelming*.

**TL;DR** I know this is a long, stupid response to a flippant joke, but this shit is important. I understand why a lot of people feel angry and resentful towards the system. There are *real* economic and social problems with todays society. There is corruption, inefficiency, and just plain unfair all over the place. But these are serious, complicated problems and they require real effort to find solutions. But to solve them, you need to understand how we got to where we are now. Fantasizing about ""seizing the means of production"" and redistributing the worlds riches according to your obviously noble, enlightened principles is incredibly destructive and will get us nowhere."

so I am in a self conflicting dilemma. I pretty much bought all my parts with exception of GPU (my concern)
of course, GPU is usually the most expensive component. So I heard Nvidia is releasing their new GPU the 11 series as lot of you know. and inevitably prices are going to be dropping for the GTX 1080/1080ti (I am not sure how much). problem is I am considering to buy the EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 SC GAMING ACX 3.0 8GB for $669 CAD, is it really worth the wait for the GPUs to drop considering the EVGA I will be picking up is discounted at $130 (100+ 30 rebate).

My brother and I were not super close growing up. We didn't have the same social circles or anything but when we got home we got on alright. 

The problem started when my father got a job in another town. I was in my final year of high-school (15-ish) so it was decided I would stay alone with my brother (17-ish) for the year and my dad would move out with the rest of my family. So, for about a year it was just my brother and I, and for that year we were constantly at each other's throats. I would come home late, he would yell and scream in my face, I would scream back. He would take my phone and password protect the laptop so I couldn't use it, so I would refuse to cook or clean for him. It was one thing after another until one time I stayed out until fairly late with my friend. I was with her parents, I was safe and I had let my dad know. But the moment I came home my brother sat me down and threatened to beat me with a large stick he had. He said because I was his younger sister I had to do everything he said. I was terrified, not only because of the threat, but because I'd seen my dad do the same thing to my mum (except my dad would follow through with the threat). I knew how terrible it would end for me, so I shut up and did as he said. I slept with a rock by my bed to feel safe after that, and I never spoke to him unless strictly necessary. After a while my parents had enough, so my mum came out to live with me and my brother moved in with my dad. 

Eventually, my brother went off to college and so did I. We'd meet back at the house during summer break and soon we talked like old times. But the moment we leave the house its radio silence, nothing from either one of us (this is my fault, he tried in the beginning but I would ignore all his calls). 

The truth is though, I miss him. He's grown from then, that's for sure, he's not as controlling and respects my freedom. But after being the one that blocked him off for so long I'm not sure how to rebuild that bridge. We don't leave near each other, and I'm pretty busy with college so it's not like I can often. How do I attempt to reconnect with him? 

Tl;Dr: I've hated my brother since I was approx. 15, but now I want to be friends again. Help me rebuild the bridges I have burnt. "	relationship_advice	relationship_advice	-1

I really don't think it works that way, but I'm pretty early into my biology degree and need a lot more experience to say for sure. I want to say it doesn't though. Fat is calorie dense so high fat could make you fat because you're eating a surplus, but that's ops goal in the first place and same calories of carbs would still make you fat if all you did was eat. 

Point being that as long as you get protein needed to build muscle even overeating on fat probably isn't going to make a huge difference. If like 90% of your daily intake is fat and you are still somehow hitting body weight in protein the issue isn't that fats are making you fat the issue is you are eating like 9k calories lol. 

Basically if you are hitting your protein goals and calorie goals with fast food in your diet you really aren't doing anything wrong. Like 30% fat or 40% fat isn't a make or break difference. If you are higher in fat you are lower in carbs or protein so it balances out weight gain wise unless you are significantly low in protein because then your bf% might increase more due to less muscle gain.

1948	"The best theory I've heard is that Kavanaugh will help Republicans overturn ""dual-sovereignty"", which allows both the federal govt and state govts to prosecute someone for the same crime. ""Gamble vs US"" is being heard by SCOTUS in Oct; Google it. The idea is that Trump could pardon Manafort and everyone else caught up in the Russia investigation, and state govts can't prosecute them, even if the crimes occurred in those states. For example, if Trump pardoned Manafort right now, NY and VA state prosecutors could bring their own charges. That's why they don't want a lengthy FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, they need him on the bench by Oct.

I understand where you're coming from. A couple points:

1. The reason for the scale (as you say 'billions of dollars worth of purchases' ) has little to do with planned obsolescence by MS and simply by the fact that they're the largest enterprise software supplier. In fact MS bends over backwards more than any large software company I know to support platforms as long as possible. Their commitment to backwards compatibility is second to none: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60HHWWo9z4, you can update from a 32 year old OS straight to a modern one and they do their best to keep minimum requirements low for sales purposes. They have no incentive to make hardware obsolete, in fact they want the opposite. I think expecting a company to support a 20-year old consumer OS is unreasonable.

2. While you're spot on about the environmental impact of electronics it is such a tiny fraction compared to other human industries like transportation, agriculture, construction etc. If we could snap our fingers tomorrow and turn every car, boat and plane to solar powered then we could triple our electronics waste and the planet would be 1000x better off. I'm not saying it's not important, I'm just saying that if you're going to throw the label 'crimes against humanity' around then you should start at the top of the corporate evil chart.

1961	"&gt; she replied it was her ex bf and that she loves her friends and he doesn't say it back.

It would have been a big problem if he would have said it to her, but it is far worse she said that to him. To say that means she is very emotionally invested in her ex, and when she said it, it appears she regarded him as her SO and not you.

In regards as to her SO is, there is overlap and there should never be overlap. So how can you convince her heart to be your 100% full-time SO? It can't be done as all she can do is follow her heart. It also means her and her ex have unfinished business, as their breakup is not final.

I advise peacefully bowing out of this relationship because it is imbalanced. You are her full-time 100% SO, and she is not yours. Whatever emotional business she has with her ex, she must deal with alone. It would also be in her best interests to be free to deal with her ex single. Otherwise, it would only pain you so much if the devotion you show to her is not returned. It would pain her also as the relationship prevents her from following her heart.

I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rq7KtM9vhHg) video yesterday and stumbled upon this jacket Alen was wearing in the video. I'm currently looking for a winter/rain jacket and this one looks just perfect.

Only problem is - I can't find anything in the video about a brand og logo about the manufacturer.

I've written directly to the guy on Instagram, but with 155k followers i don't think he's going to respond anytime soon.

Hopefully you can help me identify it so in can wear it during this winter :)

If memory serves there was a similar uproar over Dawn of War 2 where Chaos were part of the first DLC/expansion and the core game was Space Marines, 'nids, Orkz, and Eldar (?)."

Weight loss, depression (especially when it leaves your system), anxiety, heart palpitations, and some others.

In fact, if you’re seeing any hallucinations or visual changes at all, you’re taking too much for a micro dose.

I’m sure there are other reasons (and some negative aspects of micro dosing), but the long-term effects seem milder for micro dosing LSD than for taking Adderall."

If you want to believe that the left does not have a fair share of violent folks - I respect your belief as I realize it can be a hot button issue for folks. My personal belief is that the left has gotten brazen and violent enough now that some groups are now trying to run cover for them because they fear the left will not be able to only paint the right with the ""violent"" brush. Me personally I have met many people who are strongly on the left that I would decribe as violent - but that is anecdotal."	"I'd like to pick apart that last line, if you don't mind. The linguistics here are actually interesting. 

In 1960, people actually WERE homophobic. They were afraid of getting AIDS. That was a thing. Admittedly, not always a rational thing, but information was slower to disseminate before the internet. That fear manifested itself similarly to hatred and was co-opted by actual hate groups, but it's important to realize these terms didn't appear out of thin air. There is a reason their meanings have shifted from the literal roots to the more common definition. It was a process. The original ""goal"" of terming people ""homophobic"" was so you could explain that their fears were irrational. Unfortunately, when we tried to do that, we ended up applying the label to the entire sub-set of the human population who has an issue with homosexuals. While we could talk down the ones who were uninformed and scared (and, we have - look at public perception), the rabid and vocal individual's co-opted the label because it sounds better than ""assholes.""

Likewise, in 2001 I can guarantee you there were some people who were actually afraid the Middle Eastern guy in the next row was dangerous. The origin of the use of the term ""Islamaphobia"" is rooted in a discussion of the unjust application of policies and emotions that were behind stuff like the American TSA's  ""pat downs"" to check suspicious individuals for weapons. They were almost universally applied in an illogical (but highly emotional) manner, allowing people to exert control over a ""situation."" The label twas intended to be applied to people who were ACTUALLY afraid and could be taught that their fear was largely unfounded, but was again claimed as a less evil label by hate groups or radical extremists. There was a good intention, here, though I'm not sure if it worked. 

My point, though I'm not sure I made it very well, is that you shouldn't assume Johnny is an asshole. Some people are assuredly still afraid some crazy man with a bomb is going to walk into their office and detonate. It's the fear of the unknown, something they know they can't really control or stop. If you educate these people, explain things like that Sikhs are not Muslims or how few actual Islam-inspired terrorism deaths there are each year (particularly in Canada), you can accomplish a great deal more than by branding them as bigots and moving on with life. Sometimes, a bit of compassion is more useful than scorn. "	canada	canada	-1

2028	"&gt;&gt;I meant that they necessarily have the same truth value (this is what logical equivalence means), not that they just happened to have the same truth value. Sorry for not being clear on that.

&gt;You are still wrong. Plain wrong.

...and then you go on to cite a source which supports my point:

&gt;- ""In logic, statements p and q are logically equivalent if they have the same logical content. This is a semantic concept; **two statements are equivalent if they have the same truth value in every model**"" [emphasis added]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Are not logically equivalent statements, even though they both necessarily have the same truth value.

They do not necessarily have the same truth value, they just happen to have the same truth value. 

&gt;Under S5, they absolutely do, because under S5, any extraneous qualifiers are pruned.

The premise means exactly what it states: that it is possible that G exists. That's a statement about what's possible, not about what's necessary, or about what exists. We use S5 to show that that premise entails those other statements, but the premise itself is only a statement that G is possible. 

&gt;&gt;That's plainly not what the statement means. We can logically deduce ""G is"" from that premise, but that's not what the premise means.

&gt;Under S5, you are wrong.

Under what the words expressed in the premise mean, I'm right. The words do not mean that G is necessary, they mean that G is posssible. S5 is what we use to deduce the conclusion, but those logical inferences are not stated in the premise. 

&gt;They cannot be logically equivalent and mean different things. That's not how that works.

Of course they can, and this argument is a perfect example. The premise and the conclusion must have the same truth value, but they don't mean the same thing. The premise means that G exists in at least one possible world, and the conclusion means that G exists. 

&gt;The premise G is possible is merely stating G exists

False, the premise is merely stating that G is possible, not that G exists. 

&gt;In this case, to accept the possibility of G is to accept the existence of G, the element being proved, because that is the definition.

To accept the possibility of G is to commit oneself to the necessity and existence of G, yes, but precisely for the reasons that the MOA describes. It's not the case that the whole argument, S5 included, is present in the premise. The premise means one thing from which we can logically deduce other things, but those logical deductions are not part of the premise itself. 

This is also true of *any* deductively valid argument: to accept the premise(s) is to commit oneself to the truth of the conclusion.

Is teaching a kid to talk it out over violence forcing a belief on them? Isn't teaching philosophy just forcing a kid to accept a world view? I don't see why religion should be in a special category. Parents teach their kids things and try to instill values in them. As the child grows and learn they will either accept or reject the lessons.

Get out a coloring book, put on some shoes and walk outside for 15 minutes, get a bath ready and find a good audiobook to indulge in. Motivation is hard when you're down, so take whatever steps you need to make activities easy and accessible. Set a notification in your calendar to remind you. Go see a friend occasionally, even when you don't feel like you're going to be buckets of fun. Set small tasks to accomplish every day: read 20 pages of a book, give the dog a bath, finish a craft, clean your car, anything that you can check off a tangible list. Like so many others have said, get clean and dressed and make your bed. Eat and sleep as best you can.	"I'm not sure exactly why.  I wish my grandpa was alive to ask him.

2033	"First of all software should never allow you to brute force by attempting millions of logins. So that's not how brute forcing works. 

So how does it work? When a database is hacked, the hashes and usernames get sold on the internet, often for a lot of money. From the hashes, you can't reconstruct the real passwords. So hackers can: 

* Guess a password 
* Hash it
* See if it matches any of the hashes in the database. 

[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs) has a nice video where they demonstrate this in practice. As you see, hackers also use big dictionaries to guess for common passwords with variations like a 3 instead of E, or an underscore in your name. 

As others said, the MD5 algorithm that was used before is terrible. This is for two reasons: 

* Too many inputs hash to the same output. So you didn't need to crack the exact password to find a matching hash. 
* It is too easy to calculate the hash. Decent computers can calculate billions of hashes per second, and therefore guess that many passwords. 

The first problem is solved by the popular SHA-256 algorithm. It is still very easy to calculate the hash, but that's ok! That makes it very suited to verify the authenticity of files, server certificates, and blockchain mining. 

For password hashing, a more complicated cryptographic hashing algorithm is required. Currently Bcrypt and Scrypt are recommended. Only a few hundreds of hashes can be calculated each second, making brute forcing extremely ineffective.

2039	"Anti\-depressants have a suicide risk  


  [https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/anxiety\-medication.htm](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/anxiety-medication.htm)

#### Antidepressant medication and suicide risk

Antidepressants can make depression worse rather than better for some  people, leading to an increased risk of suicide, hostility, and even  homicidal behavior. While this is particularly true of children and  young adults, anyone taking antidepressants should be closely watched.  Monitoring is especially important if this is the person’s first time on  depression medication or if the dose has recently been changed.

Signs that medication is making things worse include anxiety, panic  attacks, insomnia, hostility, restlessness, and extreme  agitation—particularly if the symptoms appear suddenly or rapidly  deteriorate. If you spot the warning signs in yourself or a loved one,  contact a doctor or therapist immediately.

If you are concerned that a friend or family member is contemplating suicide, see [Suicide Prevention](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-prevention.htm). The suicide risk is greatest during the first two months of antidepressant treatment."	"Its pro trump people that are the most brainwashed though..

The Book of Mormon is a book of scripture, similar to the Bible, that is comprised of the teachings of various prophets of God who lived on the American continent between 600 BC and 420 AD. It begins with a group of Israeli refugees fleeing the Babylonian invasion of the Kingdom of Judea in 600 BC. And follows them as they are lead through the wilderness by God, and across the great ocean to the Western hemisphere where they establish a colony that grows into a thriving civilization. The pinnacle of which is when they are visited by the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, in fulfillment of centuries of prophecy. Two centuries following this Messianic visitation however, they descended into cataclysmic civil war resulting in their entire destruction.

For more information about The Book of Mormon as well as an online version of it, click on the following link: [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng) "	"It's not just one step you have to make. There are multiple steps. Learning Greek is the first step we should make. Then asking God to grant us Hes understanding would be the next step. Then the next step is reading. And repeating step 2 and 3 over and over again until it becomes as clear as pure water.

The trick of Satan is to mislead people in crowds. Satan doesn't have power over you if you don't give him your power. And that's exactly what people do if they go to a denomination. They give their brains to their sectarian so called scholars.

I read more Scriptures then you think, of different religions. And i see the same pattern over and over again. The religion gets hijacked by these sectarians who operate from the shadows.. And the crowd follows. And everyone thinks they are right, just because of their environment that is following it as well. 

Numbers do not say anything. The Scriptures teach us that the majority is misguided. Deal with it. If you want to be that blind follower. Then that's your choice. People don't care. They don't really believe. That's why they just follow their sect and environment. The majority follows the Anti Christ. Does that mean it's the Truth? Just because of the numbers? 

What about all those Jews who uphold their false Judaism which contradicts the Tora. What about all those Arabs who uphold their false Islam which contradicts the Quran. What about all those Hindus who uphold their false Hinduism which contradicts the Veda. Etc. etc. etc. 

If you see the pattern just once. It will open your eyes. Never follow the majority. If you see a group/denomination/sect etc. then know that they are mixing Truth with Falsehood. That's just the reality.

Anyone familiar with the game understands that our community is brutal. Everyone acts like Reddit/dota2 is so childish and devoid of reason, but, have you ever played Dota? It is merciless carnage. Our intelligence is questioned in the most brutal ways and our every decision assaulted into oblivion. Watch any stream, play a game yourself, ask your friends or ask random players. Reddit/dota2 is an extension of the game, not the other way around. Why would the community allow anyone else to shove it around? 

Moreover, why would you want to cater to anyone outside the community? These commercial decisions make it seem like there is some sort of hidden audience being repressed by the hordes of Reddit/dota2. ESL is not special, no more than any Anti Mage without a BKB in 3k pubs or whoever is being trolled by SingSing and Bulldog. If you get it wrong you are going to hear about it and the best thing to do is to respond positively. 

Good luck moving forward and remember to look after this community. There is no hidden upper-class of Dota audience being repressed.

If you look at the wiki page for gun related self defense, it states “Estimates over the number of defensive gun uses vary wildly, depending on the study's definition of a defensive gun use, survey design, population, criteria, time-period studied, and other factors. Low-end estimates are in the range of 55,000 to 80,000 incidents per year, while high end estimates reach of 4.7 million per year”


Logically it would be somewhere in between, even if we say it’s still on the low end at 150k or 200k, that’s still more than gun related assaults, especially if you exclude suicide which make up an enormous portion of them, which most people agree should not be considered gun violence since someone jumping off a bridge isn’t considered bridge violence.

I vote my state enacts so nationalisation can be considered socialist. For example the state owns the railway which makes it publicly not privately owned and regulated by elected officials than can be removed by public vote. Its objective is not to make profit but to provide a public service. 

Again feel free to disagree but about sticking to the original definitions academically economically but it doesn't change they way the words are used and their common meaning. Or the political movement that surround economic socialism. Socialism as a political movement was designed to combat the social issues caused by capitalism, so yes a lot of it is pro worker but in my view it's about blending capitalism in way that causes less damage, public resources needed for life such as healthcare and transport should be nationalised and owned by the public. 

Marx's definitions don't make over 100 years of progress disappear, socialism has as Marx intended has become political, just not in the way he predicted. Look at Freud, pioneer but progress has made a lot of his original work redundant, Marx's predictions did not come true and so they were adapted, economic capitalism did not progress to economic socialism in spite of the proletariat's best efforts or progress to communism. Political socialism sought to remedy that. It is a solution to a problem not oxymoronic it disagrees with Marx's predictions that makes it no less socialist. Again socialism is no longer defined by Marx in the same way Freud's theories are no longer defined by Freud. Socialism was not even defined purely by Marx when Marx was alive, what about Émile Durkheim, Max Weber or Friedrich Engels? Marx's work is not a bible, it is not the only view of economic socialism. If you ascribe ONLY to Marx fine but why assume everything else is wrong as opposed to a different interpretation or viewpoint of the same concept?"	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	-1

There's no way the Steelers cut him since they would lose their comp pick and they would still have to pay him (fully guaranteed contract). You can't rescind the tag once he's signed it.

If you look at Overthecap for 2019 (when Bell hits FA) there are plenty of teams that will have the cap room for him.

https://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space

Only 6 teams wouldn't be able to eat more than $15 million in cap room next year and with signing bonuses being spread over the contract length you can easily get his first year cap hit under $10 million.

Also trying to predict team needs a year in advance is usually a fool's errand. What looks like a strength on a team can turn to shit pretty quickly in 1 season. With career-ending injuries for players a single play away for all of them you can't say what the RB FA market will look like next off-season.

Edit:
Also teams are relying on RBBC and young RBs because they have to not because they want to. It was way easier to draw up plays if your RB can do it all compared to have specializations and your offense becomes less predictable based on its personnel groupings. They're relying on young RBs because the FA market for running backs has been shit for the past 3-4 seasons. No good RBs are hitting the market and the majority of RBs have been busts. The past 2 draft classes have been chock full of talented RBs and they will get paid top dollar once they start hitting their second contracts unlike the shit classes before them. Teams want to be spending their high round picks on players that have a larger disparity between rookie salaries and veteran salaries. They would much rather spend their 1st rounders on QBs, EDGE, and OTs rather then RBs. "	nfl	nfl	-1

I’d like to add two thoughts:

First, when months or years of labs, imaging, biopsies, genetic testing, regional referrals, etc are back negative or nondiagnostic, what should happen next?

At what point can a clinician decide that the edge of medical science has been reached?  How many negative ANAs is enough?

There are many instances, I think, that a label hasn’t or can’t be given but it becomes reasonably certain that the disease isn’t (inherently) life-threatening. Can the decision to focus on symptom management rather than looking further be justified or is it de facto quitting/abandonment?

Second, I would ask you to consider the other side of the ‘xyz’ coin.  Are there any disputed diseases that you do not believe exist?  Even if another physician suspects it?

The patient with a [Morgellons](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/29467580/?i=1&amp;from=morgellons&amp;filters=ffrft) diagnosis who requests antiparasitics or a patient with  [wind turbine syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24804716/?i=2&amp;from=wind%20turbine%20syndrome&amp;filters=ffrft) who requests a PET scan and benzodiazepines...is there a point at which it can be conscionable for you to decline treatment or workup?

2113	A lot of people have the same opinion. While some moments are polarising as in they are placed wrong, the dinosaur transformations are disliked by many of us. One sore point in otherwise great anime. 	"Yelena has been making some weird moves without paradis military consent, one of her moves that I'll be focused is her plea to spare Marleyan hostages. I found it rather odd since I really don't see her as kind person. Then I started to imagine what if Yelena is actually truly moving in the opposite interest of paradis military? This question leading me to a hypotheses that if it's true, then it'll create massive social media earthquake not only within SnK fandom.

So let's get to the point. Let's assume Yelena totally not support the military. Two questions comes to my mind: 1. Why Yelena spared Marleyan PoW?, and 2. Why don't she fully cooperate? My answer to question #1 is that she do it not out of kindness, but because she wanted to gather as many capable forces as possible to overthrow current government. So the remaining question is why she really want to get rid of them? Why, a person who have similar background with them, wants to backstab them?

After hours of reflecting, I've come to hypotheses. This hypotheses is sounds unlikely, but when I think more about it, the other puzzle started to fall easily into its place.

Here's my hypotheses: 

1. Zeke and Eren actually aimed to create a coalition with Marley, not to fight them to death.

2. Zeke and Eren will offer to Marley all the titan powers Eldian have + all of Eldian's military and technology might + obedience of Eldian to Marley under one condition : every eldian must have the same rights with their Marleyan counterpart.

3. Zeke and Eren will offer to Hizuru the rights to own ice burst stone mine in the island.

4. Zeke and Eren will force Marley to accept the condition with the rumbling threat.

5. Zeke and Eren will use coordinate power to make every Eldian convinced that they're actually Marleyan.

6. This way, Eldians will benefited from the safety Marley gave to them, Marley would benefited from every military resources they could have (including titan power), and Hizuru would benefited for the fact that they could mine those ice burst stone without fear of getting caught between Marley vs Eldia war.

This leads to a very interesting consequence if truly happened.

1. After acquiring such powerful forces. I think Marley definitely would take a shot to conquer more countries. Sorta like what germany did back in WW2.

2. People which support one side in the past suddenly support none of them. Mikasa, Gabi, Falco, Armin, and every Eldian and Marley who disagree with this direction will join forces with the rest of the world to defeat this ""Axis forces"".

3. Mikasa will stopped caring about Eren. In fact, she will loathe him intensely and wants to kill him. Armin won't see Eren as friend anymore, but an evil which must be killed.

4. Conny or Jean probably will be killed/brainwashed."	ShingekiNoKyojin	ShingekiNoKyojin	-1
2114	Yeah, if exchanging normal pleasantries with a cashier is a step too far then I'm pretty ok with disagreeing with the rest of his opinion on GG'ing. 	"The thing is, the general knowledge will exist based on balance. Sure, you could ""get better"", that's easy to say, but how? You need knowledge to improve, you need to learn from better people and, that's funny, but the balance will matter for them. 

If you look for a viable build, or you look on how better players counter a certain strategy, balance will matter in that case. Like, if you look how to defend a baneling bust, you need to find a valid answer for that. ""Get better"" and ""macro more"" is super abstract is not a valid answer to a specific problem. Which steps need to be accomplished to defend a baneling bust? What strategy I can try to imitate to practice and get better? In the case of a baneling bust, it's pretty well known strategy that is powerful, but where everybody has real advice on how to execute and defend, it feels balanced. 

When I play against an oracle that pops out at 2:55 the first time, I have no fucking idea what to do. So I ask around, I search around, I look at better players to see what they do. If I discover that even the pros themselves have no idea how to defend properly, then the balance also affects the lower players. The lack of valid and known strategies create a black hole where it feels hopeless and frustrating to play, hence the complaints about balance. 

If you want less balance complaints, you need to keep educating players and keep the knowledge flowing. The more the players think there is a solution to their problems, the less they feel the game is unbalanced. I think a player like PiG, who have incredible knowledge of the game, could act on that instead of dismissing balance discussions. People think that X thing is unbalanced? Counter it with knowledge, build orders, a gameplan and demonstrate it yourself how you do. Every balance complaint is an opportunity to teach, maybe not to the person complaining, but for the others seeing the complaint and wondering about the valid answer. "	starcraft	starcraft	-1

Because unlike the traditional use of the word ""rent-seeking""

* today you can choose to either own or rent a song. It differs from the rent seeking behavior of landlords with respect to availability of copies (unlike a landlord who owns the only copy of the piece of land he's sitting on).

* Also, land can only be rented to one person at a time, unlike music streaming (which can be sold or rented to multiple people at the same time). This sort of waters down the ""strangling"" aspect of it. They can still exert a strangle-hold by other means, like becoming a monopoly or really restrictive exclusivity contracts.

* Further more, land is a limited resource unlike music, and the landlord stakes exclusive claim to his portion of it. While with music, you can ""rent it"" on Spotify, google play, itunes, Windows store until recently. or regional third world alternatives. Some of these platforms even allow you to purchase copies (some of which are even drm free, but with traditional restrictions on distribution).

Given this obvious differences, it feels like your comment is almost a propagandist dogwhistle considering how many things it ignores and how it conflates literal and figurative (hardly, more like tangentially related) meanings of ""rent-seeking"".

Music streaming isnt any more ""rent seeking"" than, say a library's membership fee, or an author's royalty over his IP., Or an old fashioned record music sale that still restricts you from selling your own copy of it. It feels like the reality of ""the old days"" of music ownership is lost to nostalgia. You always only owned a license."	Economics	Economics	-1

Up until a few years you were taught in driving school that „...the right and middle lane are intended for permanent use while the left lane is only for passing“. Now this makes it complicated because actually in Germany you are forced to keep right in non-urban areas and if the speed limit is 60 km/h and above. But there have been several lawsuits that most people don’t know about. Now the official rule is: You are allowed to use the middle lane if there are cars in the right lane „from time to time“. Meaning that you‘re not forced to use every gap possible to switch to the right, but on the other hand: If the right lane is completely empty you are not allowed to use the middle lane. 	motorcycles	motorcycles	-1

His loud, explosive reactions and single\-minded focus on killing titans are generally regarded as bad things, because the vast majority of people understand that being like that is not healthy and, thus, they are bad personality/character traits.

It doesn't matter for the average viewer that Eren was traumatized as a child or that titans present a constant existantial crisis for humans in his universe. For the average viewer, they judge characters based on how the story presents the action of the plot. Thus, one anime can get people to cheer for a mass murderer while a second anime can get the same people to wish death upon a rape victim, all just by carefully organizing scenes in a certain manner in order to obtain an overall reaction from an audience.

 A lot of politicians do this thing where they're willing to handicap the economy to create jobs, when the same resources could be repurposed towards an effective welfare state. In doing so all of the peripherals of unemployment--no healthcare, affording food/hygiene/shelter, access to the basics necessary for effective job searching/retraining--would be made less severe; the added benefit being you don't create unproductive sectors by encouraging dysfunctional enterprise in order to create employment."	"I think that's a good enough laymen understanding of the recession. To be more specific, financial institutions knowingly misrepresented the risk of certain risk-stratified groups of loans that they were selling to other institutions. Those institutions often turned around and did the same thing. And each step along the way, the new institutions did the same tricky bookkeeping where they hid the high risk involved in the base investments by grouping them with low-risk investments but selling them as if they were ALL low-risk investments in that stratum.

So once the original loans started defaulting, it all came down like a house of cards.

There were myriad factors and reasons for this, but a big one was huge bonuses to financial institution employees for sales volumes, with very few consequences if the loans defaulted. So they were basically lying about value and printing themselves money until it all came back to bite them in the ass. Well, not them, but literally all of America. They mostly got off scot-free."

You literally said you will never support gun control, because the government might take it too far; that's a slippery slope argument. If you can't even imagine a situation that you change your stance on, then you're not asking for a debate, you're asking to argue pointlessly. Fine.

What are you looking for me to say? That you're raising legitimate points? You are. Am I calling for a nationwide gun ban? No, because I'm not stupid. The US is obviously too large to adopt that method, and aside from that, no, the government shouldn't take everyone's guns. But the current system is not sustainable, and that price of freedom is too damn high. Which is why I am in favor of better gun control measures being worked out and discussed at both state and federal levels.

Specifically I'm in favor of making it more difficult to get a gun in the first place. That includes things like psychological screenings, which you've already addressed some legitimate points on. Banning all people with certain mental illnesses is no better than profiling, so it would need to be prevented, probably best by allowing an appeal/second opinion to be had, but that opens the door for messed up people to just see psychologist after psychologist until they get a green light, which is frankly too expensive for the common person, but not an abject impossibility. It's a pretty expensive loophole, but a loophole nonetheless. Honestly not sure how to fully prevent it. I guess I'll keep thinking.

Criminals being banned from legally obtaining weapons: convicted felons lose voting rights for 2 years after they are released. Maybe a similar system there? Voting is a fundamental right, just like the right to bear arms. Or maybe people just shouldn't commit crimes if they want to have all their rights? That's the exchange when they get sent to jail, so I'm pretty sure losing the right to a firearm is a reasonable punishment, for a variety of offenses. Not all of them, of course, but definitely a few. I can already hear ""but what about the wrongfully convicted"", well then we should also be calling for reform to the judicial system, but that's a different issue that isn't even remotely able to be addressed through gun control.

Criminals illegally obtaining guns/Usage of miscellaneous weapons: that's part of why controls need to be implemented - to prevent more guns from being out there to be obtained by illegal means. This is particularly important regarding gangs, like you said. And even if we can prevent the gangs from getting guns, what's to stop them from using a machete, or a baseball bat? But then again, everyday people commit murder with miscellaneous objects or even their bare hands. If a gang wants to hurt you, then a gang is probably going to hurt you. So gun control won't impact gang violence too much. But it does prevent OVERALL gun violence, which is the point; you can't just say it doesn't solve this one problem and therefore any and all benefits of policy are moot. 

As for implementing better training as you've suggested, that'll be great for anyone who owns a gun and happens to be at the scene when something does go wrong. It's a situation that's happened before and is a legitimate to defend as a possible resolution to catastrophes. In that same vein, though, there are plenty of times when having a gun doesn't/wouldn't help a victim. Like Las Vegas, where there was no way for any of those victims to retaliate against the shooter. To be clear, I'm not against required training since it should also help prevent accidents involving guns in addition to being a great addition to the situations I mentioned above, but it's not a preventative measure against intentional misuse of a firearm.

Also I want to bring up a few additional points you mention:

&gt;There is no fucking up with this. There is no ‘well, shit, sorry we didn’t see that one coming’ and just hoping the mass societal issue a policy could generate will be ‘solved over time’

So without gun control, hundreds and hundreds of civilian deaths are the price of freedom, but with gun control the possible policy flaws are unforgivable sins?

&gt;The purpose of having a representative government rather than a direct democracy is because we need to have thought-out, reasonable, objectively considered, and debated legislation.

Yet you don't trust those same representatives to maintain your rights once even minor restrictions are in place. 

&gt;Once this threshold is crossed, there won’t be any going back, government never cede that level of legal precedent when it comes to political control. 

You're simultaneously saying that confiscation and a nationwide ban are both impossible to implement and the only logical outcome. You also say that revolution is a point of great concern regarding the right to bear arms. It's what the second amendment was for, right? Then shouldn't you be revolting against the government if they do cross the line? It's the price of freedom.

&gt; So yes, it better be the best, most thought out policy there is, because this is a serious issue we cannot afford to misstep on.

Awesome, I'm not saying it shouldn't be thought out for a long time, hence my call for everyone to be part of the process instead of being like you and trying to prevent the process from happening at all. You're not helping."	news	news	-1

Now, I definitely enjoy driving something with 4wd/awd more than driving the mustang on really snowy days (two weeks ago when we got that 15cm of snow - I took my wife's F150). It's a little more peace of mind. However

-I have never hit the ditch

-I have never run into another car or object (except my own garage door: see below)

-I have never gotten stuck (WITH the snow tires - the first winter before I got snow tires, I got stuck in my parent's crescent and my neighbor broke off my spoiler trying to push me out). 

Eventually you learn to take 'er easy in really slippery areas. For snowy areas: you don't go into a situation you can't get out of. You shovel your driveway and put down sand because the hardest part sometimes is getting up your driveway.

Oh, that thing about taking off traction control and giving it more throttle, don't do that. That's how i tank slapped my garage door and put a dent in my rear quarter. Instead shift to second and give yourself a very slow roll out. IF that doesn't work dig yourself out. Trust me.

**EDIT**

I've seen a couple replies regarding how driving in the city is different than driving in rural areas. When I first bought my Mustang, I lived in the city, near the city center, on a bus route that's plowed immediately if it snows. Now I live in a suburb and commute in on a highway through rural areas. What I've found is that it's entirely up to how the municipality or counties specify their snow contracts. In my 'city' - suburb - they have their own snow removal equipment, and everything is scraped down to bare pavement and sanded almost immediately after a snow. Half of my highway commute is one county, and their contractors are very good about clearing the highway. The second half of my highway commute is handled by the city municipality, which has their own equipment, but contracts out for this part of the highway. It's constantly awful (very slippery). And in to the big city, the municipality handles all snow removal. It's the worst. Takes them forever to get rid of the snow, they don't scrape to bare, they decided to use calcium chloride spray instead of salt/sand, and it provides no traction. The other night I had to drop my niece off after a family gathering and drove through a bunch of rural areas on side two lane highways. Didn't have any issue, just kept my speed in check."

I do care if god exists or not. I was simply saying that no I don’t belief faith can be used in a scientific way. Faith by its very nature is almost the exact opposite of science isn’t it? I mean science is observing and testing over and over. How can faith observe or test anything other then beliefs which are figments of our imagination. I’m not saying all beliefs are false I’m simply saying those beliefs and thoughts in our heads aren’t actual physical things we can see and test. 

That’s why I felt like the comment about faith never really reliably leading to truths was kind of “duh”. But, who tries to say it does anyway?

I wanted to edit in here that I don’t think faith is absolutely useless by any means. For us religious folk it’s very important. I’m simply saying faith is useless when it comes to science and truths we can verify."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

My name's VicV, been a dedicated Guild Wars 2 player since launch.  
Still fondly remember the pure excitement during the beta weekends.
I've quietly lurked your stream quite a bit and was always in awe of your ambition.
Really enjoyed your music choice and will to help new players.
Great to hear you're about to focus on more scholarly IRL achievements.
Best of luck in that regard Tophie!

Putting my hat in the giveaway because I am as you described.
Always been motivated to play and have thoroughly enjoyed GW2.

Currently my favorites activities are Wvw/Raids and [GRIFFON flying](https://imgur.com/a/roQFeJq)!
The freedom of movement the griffon allows across maps is truly amazing.
Most days you can find me at one of the griffon Master adventures,
practicing flight patterns while looting and scooting the various chests on map.
It may not make much money, but identifying gear with lots of magic find can yield nice prizes.

World Vs World is another GW2 activity that has captivated me for [countless hours](https://imgur.com/a/La3QLay).
While I have only dabbled with commanding, immense time has been spent small group and even solo play.
My favorite class to play in WvW is... THIEF   Yes, believe it. Though every class is fun and interesting.
To me, thief has shined as the most exciting to play for years; even if it's played stealthy.  
Love ganking even though some consider it controversial.  WvW is so fun sometimes, the rewards got better too.
Would be great to command more considering my server (JQ) needs it now more than ever.

Last year a friend let me into the 150 Li Raid Pugventures he led, even though it was raid progress for me.
Fast forward to today and there's a full set of [heavy Envoy armor](https://imgur.com/a/LTukLiN) ready to be forged on spellbreaker.
Something about having all the components of a legendary still separated ready to go is so pleasing.
So much so that there's also a full set of [light WvW Mistforged precursor armor](https://imgur.com/a/9rsxG7h) ready to be forged on weaver.
On top of that I've got all the components for [Verdarach](https://imgur.com/a/e3oD9HR) and Warbringer on my soulbeast.

The reason they're not assembled is because it would be nice to have an audience.
To show and share with in the community on the process and an achievement.
There was once a dream to have one legendary of each weapon type, and so I strived for it.
Crafted many of the very legendaries you're gifting here, still not quite enough.
To make VicV the lucky one is to complete this goal and then some.
You see I'd only possibly bind three;  Frenzy,  Kamohoali'i Kotaki, and The Flameseeker Prophecies.
That would complete my collection and the rest of the set could be given away just as was given to me.

Remember the WoodenPotatoes contest and the winner Shrimpy Plays?
I happen to catch one of Shrimpys streams after, it was his birthday and he was celebrating.
He was doing some WvW and ecto gambling, looked to have partied quite copiously.
It would seem he gifted some of his legendaries to people close to him 
and was planning ways to give the rest to GW2 community members. 

Prizes of this grandeur are an achievement from the gift-giver; to give the ultimate greatness to one winner.
That winner then can continue giving, if that is their intention (which it is mine).
The WP Get PoF contest grand prize is only an Eternity shy of what Tophie wants to give.
So Tophie's Lucky One is technically a one-up of sorts, as far as grand prizes are concerned.

Tophie streams progress on Twitch quite regularly so this giveaway seems true.
A lot of the time I've watched its newbie helping streams while working on this prize.
While Tophie's Lucky One isn't as grandiose technically as WP video creation Get PoF Sponsored Contest,
it maintains more accessibility for contestants;  a write in on reddit/to Tophie why you want a windfall.
Put in whatever effort pleases you in telling your story to Tophie.  To win a lottery you must play it at all.

Well Tophie, there's my story.  I'm a true PvX player loyal to the game Guild Wars 2.
Wish I could stream/entertain and give back to the community for the time and fun I've already had in game.
Certainly a prize like this would jumpstart interest in a streamer, which is what I'd hope to apply.
Surely current popular GW2 Twitch streamers could offer the same gratitude in passing on the luck through giveaways.
Even building up their account, either way they have to write in to you too!

Thank you very much for the consideration and your contribution to the Guild Wars 2 community.
Hopefully whoever recieves the luck passes it on in both form and spirit.
Glad to have the opportunity to even write about my GW2/interests in game, feels freeing having done this.
Wishing all the best in your next endeavours Tophie. May you be very successful.

"Well, as much as the trends change, people still pay for good single player experiences, just look at the Witcher 3 and the reddit circlejerk for it.

Your perspective seems to be arguing that Valve would released another HL2 again in 2018 and it would flop, but they're not making HL2. HL3 could still be as groundbreaking and innovative as HL and Portal.

&gt;I would doubt that it would be a top seller of the year game, unless Valve pumps out a ridiculous amount of marketing for it

The ""Illuminati"" does exist, in the sense that secret societies do exist, which contain powerful members, who have their own plans for this world. Unfortunately, you subject yourself to a plethora of disinformation when you research these subjects, and the Illuminati especially, with the words of Leo Taxil, William Guy Carr, etc. still alive and well. But for our purposes, the ""Illuminati"" definitely exists. The symbolism you refer to is all intertwined. Most of it can be traced back to Babylon. It's Kabbalah. It's left hand path. A symbol itself is originally meaningless, but ascribe it some purpose and it becomes an invaluable form of communication that can be hidden in plain sight. Rituals (performances) become a way to subliminally alter the consciousness of the masses. That's what magick is.

2176	The infrastructure in the south is generally not able to handle winter weather storms so I feel for you guys there. However, if you are able to salt at least before and after the storm (or rain) has come to a stop it should help quite a bit regardless if some of the salt gets washed away during the storm. Salt works by dissolving into the water which lowers the freezing point of this now salty water in comparison to pure water. So if the salt is melting the snow, some of the salt has already dissolved into the water and therefore even if some salt gets washed away that left over water has a lower freezing point than it once did before any salt. Given, you are correct that if it continues raining for a while it will obviously decrease the amount of salt in the remaining water but that is why you must salt before and after the storm (even once during if you notice it's slippery).

That said, being together for six years is a LOT longer than two years (and sorry, reality check, most everyone you know counts it as two years, not four) so I wouldn't be too furious at the parents for initially excluding you. Why in the world would they think you'd want to go? It's very unusual.

2189	"It's important and it's not important. 

It is important what people believe in particular Dany and Jon, if he thinks Rhaegar is his father. If Dany thinks he is real, he is a legit, male-descendent Targayren claimant who is before her in her succession. Would Danaerys Stormborn, Mother of dragons, respect the established laws of succession, or would she rather fight he own family for her ambition? Does she consider herself above the law? If so, this might be bad. And would she allow him to get near her dragons and maybe claim one? 

it will also be interesting to see how she reacts to this news. Presented with all the information in-story, what does she want to believe? If she believes he is legit, she will have family again, a nephew, maybe future husband. She will not have children, but she will have grandnephews and/or grandnieces. Would she rather want to believe so she can have that, or rather not believe and be the special one who claims the throne? She#d be in the same position when she was just the younger sister of Viserys, but she is a queen now, and I doubt she can go back. 

What Job thinks is in that regard only interesting if he turns out to be a legitimate son and heir like in the show. I think (?)  annulment like in the show means he is the heir. And as heir he has a duty to fulfil. Also, it puts him in direct opposition to Aegon and Dany, since his claims in that scenario supersede theirs. If he is an illegitimate son, and indeed now part of house Stark, he is no threat and both can ally with him. And it could relieve Dany of a lot of concern since fighting Aegon doesn't mean she exterminates her family. "	"I also don't think 'leading Tywin on a merry chase' was part of the original plan.  When Catelyn is returning from Renly's camp, one of Edmure's outriders states that Robb's forces are plundering the west, driving sheep and goods and the like.  Someone even laughs at the idea of the Greatjon being a shepherd if I recall.  That doesn't strike me as the 'highly mobile' force, just waiting for Tywin's attack.

Not to mention, Tywin's defense of King's Landing was only possible if Renly were to die and a bunch of his loyal supporters joined up with the Lannisters to defeat Stannis.  By the time Robb was making all his plans, Stannis and Renly were not fighting one another and were seemingly advancing on King's Landing, so I imagine the plan was mostly ""Hey, we're gonna go start messing up the West to put Tywin in an unwinnable position where he has to choose between his lands and King's Landing.""  But when Tywin advanced on Robb's paltry forces that are apparently pillaging and looting and siege-ing pointless castles, Edmure jumps in between them because that shit is gonna get messy real fast.

Robb's initial push into the west had to just be a couple goals.

1) Stop the new Lannister army from hemming them in.

2) Put Tywin in a position where he can't be everywhere at once

3) Count on the Baratheon bros to be the real muscle to finish off the Lannisters.

I truly don't believe Edmure is so dumb that he sat in war councils, heard the plan of ""And then we draw Tywin west and trap him at this location our scouts found"" and then turn around and say to his river lords ""Nah, we're supposed to do this different thing instead"".

When Edmure is confronted with his 'mistake', he says he was never told, and Robb only says that he was told to hold Riverrun, which means that yes, apparently Edmure never knew about the plan to trap Tywin.  That makes me think there was no plan to trap Tywin by the time Robb left."	asoiaf	asoiaf	-1

2192	"I've had a lot of relationships and watched friends have a lot of relationships. 

Honestly, the best ones I've seen are the ones which make both partners feel like they have an opportunity to feel happier, whether that's through improving their health or their outlook or taking better care of themselves. 

Something in your post stuck out at me though:

&gt;I'm not planning on telling him bc I'm worried if I told him I have all these things I need to fix and am working on, he's gonna think it's too much to deal with. So I'd rather work on it on my own without having to rely on him for emotional support for it. 

So the long and the short of it is: If this guy is good for you and he's the right guy for you, then there isn't anything you need to hide from him.

One of the things that happens when you're in a stable, healthy relationship is that you and your partner are able to talk about how you feel, talk about your concerns and worries, and talk about things you find difficult or frightening, without either shoving that all onto your partner's plate or refusing to let them anywhere near it.

Relationships really are all about sharing, and while I suspect you come from a background where there wasn't much support or care available for you, that person will have time and space for you, and you'll be allowed to have your own concerns and your own needs, and you won't be pushed away to just deal with those alone.

I'm guessing (from my own experience) that you're accustomed to having to be very self-reliant. Nobody was ever going to come and dry your tears and solve your problems for you, so down in the core of you you believe that you always have to be ready for the world as you know it to just drop you completely at a moment's notice. You believe that you'll always need to be able to pick up your shit and be ready to walk away if you want to feel safe.

I know this because I've felt the same.

But it isn't true.

You won't always be treated the way that the people in your past have treated you. When you find a partner who loves you and cares about you, you will find that a bond of trust grows between you and that you will be able to be vulnerable and you will be able to ask for their help. The surprising thing about this is that it does not make you weaker, which was always my fear. I feared that if I let myself start 'relying' on somebody else, if I let myself get ""too comfortable"" and started to ""take things for granted"" then when it all fell apart as I was sure it inevitably would, I'd be left broken and helpless.

But it turns out it doesn't work that way.

When you start to trust someone and allow them to see all of who you are, even the bits you're afraid they might not like, a pretty startling thing happens: you start to see that those things that you've been trying to keep anyone from seeing, the things that you're ashamed of or the things that make you feel weak or like you're damaged? They're not that big a deal. You start seeing them through someone else's eyes, and as your partner opens up to you, you see that they too have things they feel ashamed about or places where they're too bruised to bear being touched.

Your post is full of fears; fears that you'll spoil it all, fears that you'll rely on him too much, fear that he'll feel pressured, fear that you aren't reading him right and one day he'll just ghost you...

...they're all legitimate fears. It's not that you're wrong or that you're inventing problems or anything.

The thing that I'm trying to articulate is that if you share these things with your guy and if he's the right guy for you? He'll understand. He'll listen. 

Right now you've pretty much decided that the responsibility for managing the balance and exchange of emotions and emotional labour in this relationship is your responsibility. You've decided that you're saving him from a lot of hard work by just managing all of your relationship-related feelings, thoughts and worries all by yourself. And that's not an unreasonable way to think. But I'd like you to ask yourself this:

Imagine that your lovely guy were having all these thoughts and experiences that you were having. Imagine if he found that being with you made him feel so happy that he felt able to improve himself and care for himself. Imagine if you discovered that he'd been carefully concealing some things that he didn't like about himself, things he was afraid you'd think were too much work, because he feared you'd think he was too much work.

You'd want to know, right? You'd want to be able to tell him that it didn't change what you thought of him, maybe you'd even want to tell him how attractive you found it that he was striving to be a healthier, happier person and that he was willing to admit to his flaws so that he could try and mend them.

You feel like he's doing so many good things for you, but I don't think you realise how many good things you could do for him by being your real self. He clearly likes you, likes who you are. If he's the right guy, he'll be ready to develop an understanding of what makes you the person you are - good things and bad things, the fun stuff and the hard stuff.

You're clearly smart, you're clearly strong, you're clearly emotionally intelligent and you obviously have the drive and the desire to be happier and to be healthier. If this guy is the right guy for you, you are either going to have to come clean about your worries and insecurities sooner or later or you're going to have to accept that you'll only ever be able to have half of a relationship with him while you carefully 'protect' him from the truth of you. 

The truth of you doesn't sound like it's any worse than the truth of most of the people you're going to meet in life, but with the added bonus that you're smart, you understand yourself, and you're driven to be and to feel better. If he doesn't like that? Then he's not the guy for you.

Go be real. I think you deserve to be."	"I'm so sorry this happened to you. 

My mum died last year when I was pregnant with my own first baby, a daughter.

I too have kept so many of her things including her ceramic artwork and knitted things, knowing they were shaped by her hands. I wear her clothes and pyjamas and they feel the closest thing to a hug from mumma. I get why you're feeling so sad. 

We released my mum's ashes into the ocean at our favourite beach in our home town. We threw lots of flowers into the sea for mum with her ashes, and they all washed up along the shoreline and looked really pretty. Then people kept walking along and picking them up. I wasnt angry or sad - I kept thinking that maybe that flower made someone's day that was having a hard time, and mum was helping them.

I'd argue that the former isn't a job for Null Object. If a `null` is an error, then just error. Don't make an object that delays the error; if anything, throw an exception: If you got a null, fail because it's an error in usage. If you were going to return a null, then either it's 1 (in which case, either throw an exception or let the callee throw because you passed null to it), or 2, which is the proper reason to use a NO.

2210	We take nap and cuddle before. And if we wake up from nap at around the same time or if one of us is already awake by the time the other wakes up, then we have sex. 	I’ve just realised that when I get really playful/annoying and needy when lounging with a partner, I’m really just testing their patience hoping for a couple of spanks to put me in my place. In that context it either relaxes me, or gets me fired up for sex. During sex where I’m being more submissive, it’s just awesome to have it thrown in at random intervals. Just a couple of increasingly hard spanks is usually enough for me as opposed to a full spanking session, but they can be fun too once in a while. I don’t even really think about where they land because I personally like to be left with a bruise. For someone who might not, I’d do some research as to where is best to aim for to minimise leaving marks 	sex	sex	-1
2211	"Let me explain where the slowing force of the tides comes from, as best as I can at least.

The Moon pulls on the part of Earth that is below it, making it bulge towards the Moon. This is high tide. 

Meanwhile, the Earth spins, moving the part that is bulging so it is no longer directly below the Moon, but a little offset. 

Because the bulge is trying to turn away as the planet spins, but the Moon is still pulling on it (since it has mass), this slows down the motion of the planet's spin like a brake. 

Since gravity is mutual, the pull of the bulge also makes the Moon move a little bit faster, effectively making it gain the energy lost from the planet's spin. Some energy is lost to heat, caused by friction from the bulge against itself and the rest of the planet as its atoms and molecules try to move.

Compared to these forces, the impact of a wave against a shore is so negligible in terms of energy that it would have no noticeable impact on the process, if it even could have an impact. If you are considering Earth as a closed system, remember that angular momentum is always conserved. 

If there were no Moon, there would still be waves and movement in the ocean's water, but these would not affect the Earth's spin (i.e. it's total angular momentum) as they must by the laws of nature come out in the wash.

TL;DR, the slowing of the Earth's spin does not come from the impact/friction of tidal waves, but from the asymmetrical pull of the Moon's gravity influencing both bodies."

I think everybody gets jealous when they see their partner forming relationships with the opposite sex. The important thing is to keep your jealousy in check. Yes, you don't like this, but is she really doing anything wrong? Is she giving you a reason to think she's being unfaithful (**not** her past, but in *your* relationship)?

My boyfriend (21)  and I (18) literally decided we should be in a relationship together three days ago and bad things are already starting to happen. 

Almost every time I go to his house we have sex because of our high sex drives. There’s nothing different about this day except the fact that I was on my period.. my heaviest day actually. 

We started missionary and everything was great and everything felt great for the both of us. For some reason he came quick today which I was flattered by and it turned me on more. By the second time he came I wanted to get on top of him because that’s my favorite position. 

He gets from on top of me and lays down but before he lays down for some odd reason he takes a whiff of my bloody vagina and then gags. So there’s this moment when i’m looking at him and he’s looking at me. Maybe he didn’t mean to do it out loud who knows. He asked me if I was okay and I replied yes but then asked are YOU okay? 

I looked at his penis and saw my blood all over which made him gag again. I bent down to smell it and yes, of course it was disgusting but I didnt know it was this disgusting. Listen to this 

He says nothing. Gets up from the bed, runs into his bathroom, and he begins throwing up all the sushi we got this afternoon. It wasn’t just a little bit of throw up but a ton. 

I’m in this weird situation when idk if I should follow him or stay there or what so I decided to just put my clothes on. After I did that I walked outside because hearing him throw up made me sick. Soon after he followed me out there asking if I was mad and that he was sorry. I’m not sure if I should be mad honestly. I have no clue how I should feel in this situation. After that I came up with an excuse then hurriedly left and neither of us texted each other. 

How should I feel about this embarrassing thing that happened to me? I don’t think i’ll recover. Will he get sick every time he thinks of having sex with me now? Was his reaction normal? "	sex	sex	-1

Definition of a triangle is useful, because there are many things that have properties that can be fairly accurately described using laws governing triangles, for example you can nicely render pictures or animations when you assume that data in your RAM describes some triangles.

2295	"I think I'm loosely following what you're getting at but I'm not 100%. Basically it's all just data, and how it's stored and displayed depends on the medium. When you produce a copy of a VHS, you're taking a low quality physical medium (magnetic tape) that is very susceptible to damage and copying it to digital (requires digitizing) or to another VHS (bad medium with physical flaws). In the transfer from mediums, information is lost. Going from digital to digital is easy because in the end it's just reproducing 1s and 0s. ""Lossless"" essentially means that you can throw away information without it being visible apparent that you did. Video compression algorithms and processing have improved over time allowing this to be possible. 

Some youtube videos look good or bad for the same reason. Some bottleneck caused the quality to be bad. Either their source copy was bad (VHS) or their transfer of that information wasn't good (low quality rips, highly compressed output, etc). 

BR has become as close to the original in quality because the bottlenecks have been reduced or removed in most cases. Most films from before were shot on 35mm film which has similar ""resolution"" to 4-6k digital, though film doesn't have pixels so it varies. Therefore, the quality has always been there, we just lacked the technology to transfer that to digital, mostly because converting that much information into digital video decades ago was extremely difficult and nobody would be able to display it even if they wanted. It was pointless. Now people have BR players and 4k TVs, meaning that it makes sense to reproduce these old movies in better digital formats, especially now that technology has made it easier and more economical. 

In short, it's become easier and cheaper to remaster older movies, and now it makes sense because we can store a 50GB on a dual layer BR disc versus a 4.7GB DVD of yesteryear and actually watch them because of better TVs and better disc players. 

I was kind of all over the place because it's late and I'm tired but hopefully that helps a bit. A lot of factors lead to where we are now.

2309	"Mireles Lore.5942

I have been playing Guild Wars since Prophecies released and leading a guild for all 13 of those years.  My passion is my guild.  While it might not be a game mode I believe that it is people and community that keeps the game alive and entertaining.  Rest assured I do not ever intend to quit and will keep going for another 13 so long as support isn't dropped from the Guild Wars universe. 

As far as actual game play.  I enjoy all the game modes.  The most active I am probably is in raids, currently 3 days a week. While to a point the could be considered money making, I clear run raids multiple times a week for no profit after the first.  I have been leading teams and clearing them since release and host casual raids to bring people into the mode.  I love it because of the coordination with others that is required.  Large enough to meet many people but small enough to get to know some of these people spending hours with them every week.  I have met many talented and friendly players I have known for years inside and outside raiding.

Really, I play this game because of the people and friendships I make long the way.  Without them the game would get old quickly.  I love constantly meeting the people that come into my guild.  I take great pride in leading it.  The vast majority of my time is spent maintaining it and making it a place everyone can enjoy their time in and make some great friends along the way.

Why do I want set of legendaries?  Lets be honest.  Who doesn't want 22 legendary weapons?  They are awesome and expensive skins.  They would defiantly get bound and used.  It would also be particularly convenient to have stat swap-able weapons in addition to armor, and hopefully trinkets soon so I can freely play all my classes, in any mode, without being limited by cost or inventory space.

I only own one legendary weapon, Juggernaut.  I hate farming with a passion and avoid it wherever I can.  I simply do not have time to labor in a game.  Most of my gold is made with long term investments in items I believe will go up in value.  You can ask just about anyone in my guild how much I detest grinding maps like Silverwaste or Istan for profit and rather spend time doing things I enjoy with people I enjoy, even if there is no practical benefit to my account.

2320	"First of all software should never allow you to brute force by attempting millions of logins. So that's not how brute forcing works. 

So how does it work? When a database is hacked, the hashes and usernames get sold on the internet, often for a lot of money. From the hashes, you can't reconstruct the real passwords. So hackers can: 

* Guess a password 
* Hash it
* See if it matches any of the hashes in the database. 

[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs) has a nice video where they demonstrate this in practice. As you see, hackers also use big dictionaries to guess for common passwords with variations like a 3 instead of E, or an underscore in your name. 

As others said, the MD5 algorithm that was used before is terrible. This is for two reasons: 

* Too many inputs hash to the same output. So you didn't need to crack the exact password to find a matching hash. 
* It is too easy to calculate the hash. Decent computers can calculate billions of hashes per second, and therefore guess that many passwords. 

The first problem is solved by the popular SHA-256 algorithm. It is still very easy to calculate the hash, but that's ok! That makes it very suited to verify the authenticity of files, server certificates, and blockchain mining. 

For password hashing, a more complicated cryptographic hashing algorithm is required. Currently Bcrypt and Scrypt are recommended. Only a few hundreds of hashes can be calculated each second, making brute forcing extremely ineffective.

"Lightroom does have problems with demosaicing on Fuji's X-trans sensor (Fuji cameras with Bayer sensors like the original X100 or X-A Series are not affected). It's particularily noticeable with landscape shots that have foliage, grass, rock or other small details in them. The sharpening algorithm then creates wormy or painting-like artifacts in those fine details and it's a pain to get good sharpening. 

Rawtherapee, Darktable, Iridient developer, capture one pro (these are the ones I've tried) all work better out of the box in that regard.

If you still want to use lightroom and don't mind complicating your workflow a bit for a gain in image quality, you can purchase Iridient X-transformer, which converts RAF files to special DNG files that lightroom can handle much better.

2354	"Yea if contemporary writings from the same time period the gospels were supposed to take place existed it would at least suggest some hallucinating cult leader who was crucified for thinking he was god in the flesh and a bunch of people following him around like a prophet.

This is basically the story of Mark which is the oldest extant gospel. The resurrection was added after the fact. Two other gospels are based on Mark and some lost document sometimes called Q. They fabricated lineages and virgin birth stories and included a resurrection story complete with an empty tomb.

The gospel he mentioned is the most recent of the 4 gospels written somewhere around the writings of Josephus and possibly based on the logos. The writings of Josephus were more around the historical events of the destruction of the Jewish temple and the Jewish messiahs that actually lived and recorded king Herod, some dozen people named Jesus, and the other people found in the gospels such as John the Baptist and Pontius Pilate.

The gospels record these people differently so suggest they existed in both narratives but the gospels changed them for poetic license to implant some made up character into history. Eseubius (spelling?) forged Josephus around 400 AD to make it look like this Jesus was historical. The next best writing to mention the christians simply says there was a cult surrounding a Chrstus sometimes interpreted as Christ which simply means savior or the same thing as messiah and the Jews had quite a few failed historical messiahs.

Around 200 years *after* the forgery of Josephus the church leaders determined anything but the holy trinity version of god/jesus/holy spirit was a heresy and that led to a few schisms including Eastern Orthodox and the sect that eventually led to Islam. 

Since this time another 900 years passed before Protestantism and the Catholic church reformations. Recently (1965) the Catholic church has been a lot more open to other religions and science partly popularized by an even older statement from the time of Galileo (the bible tells us how to go to heaven not how the heavens go)... even after all this time it took until around 1900 for some people (mostly americans) to ditch science and return to biblical literalism including a literal Jesus, a literal flat earth, and a literal 6000 year ago 6 day creation. 

Basically true Christianity took 95 years after the supposed Jesus lived to be a separate identity, 20 years after he supposedly lived for any biblical writings to exist that still survive, even longer for anyone to recognize Christianity as an actual religion based on an actual dying and rising man god, and hundreds of years to determine the nature of the Christian god... The bible is comprised of books put in it before people agreed on Jesus being historical and edited to make him look historical and edited poorly that thousands of contradictions remain. 

There is no contemporary writings of Jesus from his life and zero evidence for the savior cults that sprung out of Judaism to be following around a historical character (that had all the attributes of jesus) during the time he was supposed to have lived. There is plenty of evidence to suggest Jesus was made up to satisfy some messiah claim and only believed by one sect who ignored he failed to return with a golden new Jerusalem in the second century AD or earlier. Every christian since then has made up a new version of heaven and Hell and interpreted the bible differently to make it somehow jive with their grasp on reality.. Sometimes ditching reality when they get too caught up in the myth."	"&gt;  would like to have the freedom to have my child circumcised (if I have one) for non-religious reasons.

These not qualified people defaulted on their mortgages and lost their homes. 

Often the buyers were not as knowledgeable about home finance as they should have been. And the mortgage lenders were crooks who wanted to sell a bunch of mortgages, put them all together and sell the package as a Collateralized Mortgage Obligation. Basically a big bond. 

When the default rates on these suckers went through the roof, the economy tanked. Lehman went under, unemployment went up. Etc.

"I think you bring up a valid point, and I'm sorry that people have taken offense to your expression of your opinion.

I don't support homosexuality, but as you bring up in your post, it can be challenging to separate the sin from the sinner. I think God calls us to call out the sin, but to love the sinner. 

If you were to see a gay person beaten and bloodied on the side of the road, would you walk by and say that they got what was coming to them? Or would you wrap your cloak around them, give them shelter and help them on their way?

Unfortunately, in today's society gay men and women are often treated as second class citizens. They are beaten, murdered and discriminated against. Even if we disagree with their life choices, I think the Bible teaches us to approach them with kindness and compassion (Love in an Agape sense, not an Eros sense), lest we fall in to legalistic trap that Pharisees and Sadduces fell into. 

What does Jesus say about calling out sin?

 “If your brother or sister\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23743a)\] sins,\[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23743b)\] go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.**16** But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.’\[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+18%3A15-17&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-23744c)\] **17** If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector""

2401	"Baumol's cost disease refers to the tendency of industries with the highest productivity gains to make up for a smaller and smaller share of GDP over time. As productivity increases, production costs tend to drop. This typically leads to decrease in price and increase in quantity. Depending on the starting values of price and quantity produced and their relative changes, the monetary value of total output can either increase or decrease. Once the industry is developed enough, the quantity produced is often large to begin with, so the downward effect of decrease in price tends to be larger the upward effect of increase in quantity.

The productivity here can be thought of as the number of students a professor can teach every year or the number of (good) papers a professor can write every year. There's only so many students that can sit in a lecture hall, so increasing the productivity of a single lecture can be difficult. Alternative teaching methods, like online lectures, might of course do the trick, but they're not that popular at the moment.

Hence, if productivity has increased in other sectors of the economy but stagnated in universities, we can use Baumol's cost disease to think of this phenomenon. If the productivity gains in other sectors of the economy have lead to them making up smaller share of the GDP than, say, a decade ago, it wouldn't be too hard to imagine how the relative share of GDP used to university education would be higher than before."

The other three quarters aren't insignificant but I doubt they're all that bad to be honest.

2423	Just quit bro . You're wasting your time and your money. Do Molly one weekend and feel happy for weeks... Weed is a waste it was fun as a teen but when I started being a loner stoner I realized I was just numbing my depression and escaping reality. Weed is way overrated. I used to do it as an enhancer... Like with friends to make playing PlayStation or basketball or watching a movie better.  When you're alone and getting stoned there's not much point especially if you're not even feeling good. Just quit is the best thing you could do. Weed can cause anxiety and depression. 	You can do it. I’ve gone from heavy use to none at all multiple times over the past 10 years. It’s been a couple years since I last smoked. It’s never easy. They say marijuana isn’t addictive but you most certainly will feel terrible without it for a few days. It affects serotonin levels in your brain so if your brain is used to having it then you cut it off it takes a little bit for you to level back out. That’s my theory. You will feel so much better once you get past those first few days though. I’m not against marijuana by any means. I love it. I just always end up overdoing it and smoking multiple times a day except for when I’m at work. Then when I’m at work I feel weird and almost “high” because I’m used to being high. When being high is my normal then my normal becomes high. If that makes any sense. I have respect for people who can just smoke every once and awhile...or people who smoke heavily and still function normally but I just can’t do it. Just remember when you’re feeling really crappy, irritable, and anxious that it’s going to pass and you’re going to feel better soon. It’s disheartening to know that marijuana is making you not feel well and when you stop you’re going to feel even worse than you already do. I promise it’s worth it though. 	Drugs	Drugs	-1

You recognise that so far you've had an inability to get over Danny, that you might never be over him, but you're also completely not in contact with him and never will be. He's just a memory at this point. We hold onto memories and we romanticise the past. For you, it sounds bigger than this, but that's a problem that will heal with a lot of time hopefully. You've made all the right steps to heal.

I don't think you're unfit for marriage. I think you'd probably be going into marriage with a more self-aware and healthier mindset than most couples.

We love people differently and have the capacity to love more than one person, or love people in different amounts. Instead of lying about it or hiding it, you've been self aware about it and communicated it honestly to EVERYONE.

You're not unfit for marriage. You know you need to get over Danny. You know you also love George. I'd just give you the advice to continue waiting before making a bigger commitment i.e. marriage and kids unless your mind changes. Wait another year. Talk this through with your therapist.

"I prefer the next step on that thought train back towards government having a legitimate purpose - The buzzword of the day is ""Classical Liberal"". You as a citizen, from the governments perspective, and be classified and considered, data pointed and tracked, in literally countless ways. And you ARE. But since those ways are in the millions, and as such functionally anonymous, we're basically okay with that.I hold the basic supposition that this is close to the right stopping point, but a stop or two off of Platonic Ideal - Which would be that the government acknowledges that a person can be classified a FUNCTIONALLY LIMITING number of ways - Trying to treat white people different than black people is a moral wrong. I'm not asking, that's a statement, to be clear - And it goes vice versa, and it works when you swap out ANY grouping into ANY slot there. Tune the details however you like - The verb portion here is the grand problem.Our government has demonstrated a repeated, moralistic, corruption oriented, religiously supported, racially driven history of atrocities. A large factor of cold war, prohibition, slavery, civil rights, and a dozen more EPOCHS of cultural events contain categories of atrocities written in blood with triple digits in broad body counts in dozens of event files. I get it. One hundred percent true.  
The knock on effect of this perspective is that.... Well.  The idea is that we are individuals, government is an inherently fucky process, and we should -only-at all times in the eyes of the law on every front available be treated equal in the most maximalist interpretation and structure/contexting possible. Equal under the eyes of the law, at all times, in all ways, including how we treat each other individually. This idea for a governmental kernel is so fundamental it functions as a personal philosiphy - Further knock on effect that produces spicy friction on the internet is that such a freedom oriented idea attracts people who have other reasons to firmly agree with one of the follow up principles this solid fact implies -  Identity politics is a moral failure of the grandest portion as such.

I'm from Germany by the way, not that that really matters, but I wanted to mention it in order to give a little weight to my point, because it's not unreasonable Germany-bashing from somebody feeling fucked over by the EU.
Germany heavily subsidizes its agriculture, especially livestock farming on a super industial level. So much in fact, that there is too much manure in germany, which gets dumped on farming land and is a problem for the groundwater, causing nitrate pollution in some of the agriculture-heavy parts of germany. (seriously wtf)
Another thing is, that workforce from eastern europe is extremely cheap, so they basically just pour in cheap labor for work in these big fat meat plants and pay them next to nothing for chopping up like 100 cows a day. (compared to normal german pay, especially if you talking social benefits, since germany has pretty much crossed that out for people working low wage jobs (i'm paraphrasing here a little but germany doesnt really hand out too much for free))
That's why (coupled with the benefits due to the euro) a rich country like germany can actually UNDERCUT meat prices in romania etc., which is pretty fucked up when you think about it. So we basically pollute our own country in order to screw over the rest in industrial lifestock farming.

The science has been done, and there is significant evidence.  Above is linked just one study, but there are many others.  At this point, we know that gender differences have a definite impact on the lives and careers we choose.  You had best get used to the fact--it IS a fact.

The degree of impact in relation to other factors?  That is still not settled and perhaps it never will be.

Questions like ""are men and women evenly represented across X"" will of course frequently be answerable by ""no"" and so these questions will always be polarizing.  Framing the question like this is an unproductive exercise unless your aim is to divide people.

We should be asking more questions like ""Is everybody living a fulfilling life of their choosing?"", ""Who is being left behind, really?"", and ""Why?""

I’m not a religious person, so I cannot speak for religious people. But to me, belief in a God cannot be objectively deserved.

If faith does good in those people’s lives, then I do think it deserves to exist. Where the problem lies, is when these beliefs are mistaken for objectives truths. And when those beliefs are used to influence policy, wars, even the way we treat other human beings. I think it’s important to recognize faith for what it is—belief without evidence. And for religious people to respect that faith is personal, but that this doesn’t make it any less beautiful. And for secular people to respect the faith of others, and attempt to understand them as human beings. 	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

Last episode, Chtholly cut the island in half. That was intentional. *Timere - the sixth beast*, can split and regenerate until they run out of bodymass, or something like that. But the laser shooting mech unicorn that spawned after the 217th kill wasn't a *timere*, we don't know what it was and how to kill it. 

The decision was to retreat, and organize firepower/cannons to sink the island to prevent the beast from getting a stronghold in the sky. But it would take some 10 odd days to make the preparations to sink the island, so Chtholly went ahead and cut it in half instead.

2492	"The problem with grouse shooting and raptor persecution is basically this:

* it takes place in vast, uninhabited areas (in England and Wales there's not even necessarily a right to roam) - there's a very low likelihood of the crime even being detected.
* it's low on police priorities with little resource allocated to it - when such crimes do  get reported very little is done typically to investigate
* the immediate perpetrator, if caught, is typically a poor gamekeeper - fines are adjusted with the criminal's ability to pay. The landowner/employer can step in on their behalf later or simply hire someone else, either way, it's inexpensive for them to deal with while they reap the benefits of the crime.
* it's impact is even higher than just affecting the land owned by the grouse shoot as it creates a population sink - you maintain artificially dense populations of prey animals and kill predators that enter. With no predators there already staking a territorial claim, more predators migrate in from the surrounding land and in turn are killed.
* this is all down to the style of hunting employed. Walk-up grouse hunting in other countries doesn't incentivise this behaviour. Driven grouse shooting allows the client(s) to shoot literally hundreds of birds over a weekend and the various estates compete to offer the largest number of birds. To maintain these ridiculous numbers they have to get ruthless with predator control and some will break the law in order to get that edge. We don't know how big that group of law-breakers are but we can certainly see the effect statistically.

Banning driven grouse shooting seems like the most sensible option; then the uplands might finally have hares, birds of prey, foxes, badgers, bushes and trees upon them rather than just grouse and patchworks of burnt heather. Grouse shooting would still go on but not with industrial-scale bags of birds being shot and with each estate competing over factors like hospitality, natural beauty, expert guides etc."	"I don’t like this sort of approach

I'm interested in three main things from this year, weightroom wise:

- Increase my strength (lifts) by at least 50% - so I start approaching intermediate levels.
- Increase my weight from 73kg to 80kg, without ballooning in fat. (I'll eat 300-500 above TDEE and measure).
- Increase my flexibility measurably every month - by stretching every day

And so, I'm worried that 531 will make me slower at achieving #1

But because ""religion"" it gets a pass and people still give to the organization which will only cause more incidents like this.

A homeless person could be staying temporarily on a friend's sofa or living in temporary accommodation provided by a local charity or the council.

"They're very different, at least mechanically speaking.

Ori is a very linear experience. While the structure is open and you can backtrack, the rewards are usually just standard expansions; you're moving from zone to zone in the intended order and backtracking only if you want to. I'd almost argue that Ori isn't a Metroidvania, as little would change if they snubbed the small side paths and moved the upgrades to the main route—it's less about exploration but more about seeing the setpieces and visuals they've built. Not a knock against the game, just a description.

Hollow Knight really digs into the open structure. The game doesn't give you a whole lot of direction so you're left to explore it for yourself. The structure is so light that players will often take pretty dramatically different routes throughout the game, and each unexplored nook can be anything: it might be a small upgrade, it might be a major upgrade, it might be an entirely new zone. There's something of an intended path, but it's more likely that you'll stumble upon it rather than be told.

You are looking for the Physical Sky and Earth and ignore all Spiritual Understanding. Physical Sky and Earth are not the True Earth and Sky they are just images of such. This is the Carnal (Physical) Mind at work and is the True Death.

Romans 8:6
6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

Wait you mean to be Physically Minded is Death, don't you have to die for death to be death?!?! Of course you are stating as such. You having been able to figure out what the True Death and True Life are. You think that you breath and walk physically therefor you must have Life. What rubbish.

What did Christ say?

John 6:63
63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

The whole ordeal took hours for a clearly guilty dude. (This seems excessive to me, I'm not suggesting the cops in Philly should have spent hours on this).

In this case the cops are calling for backup within 3 mins, if backup was sent at 4:45 it would have taken some time to arrive, and then pretty quickly they were en route.

"Background: I'm the son of immigrant parents currently living the US. We're Asian so parents living with their eldest son isn't unusual in Asia but in America it's considered as not being independent and could be a deal breaker. The main reason why I want them to live with me is ever since we moved here (1997) my parents have never made a combined salary of over 45k. For that reason they still to this day work 7 days a week with each of them working 10+ hours. As a result they have never taken a day off except for when my grandpa passed away where they took a week off. We have a small business that's just doing ok. For those reasons I feel like I owe them big time and also because I had the privilege of growing up here too. Also, my dad told his dad to live with us in America, in which he did.  


My question is, how would that affect my life as a whole?  Would my dating life be ruined? Assuming I reach financial stability once I get a job, would that change things?

2574	"I didn't elaborate because I've had this conversation before and it tends to end up dragging on forever, but here, 3 seconds of googling, [US National Library of Medicine](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/traits/intelligence):

""Like most aspects of human behavior and cognition, **intelligence is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors**.

Intelligence is challenging to study, in part because it can be defined and measured in different ways. Most definitions of intelligence include the ability to learn from experiences and adapt to changing environments. Elements of intelligence include the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and understand complex ideas. **Many studies rely on a measure of intelligence called the intelligence quotient (IQ)**.

Researchers have conducted many studies to look for genes that influence intelligence. Many of these studies have focused on similarities and differences in IQ within families, particularly looking at adopted children and twins. **These studies suggest that genetic factors underlie about 50 percent of the difference in intelligence among individuals.** Other studies have examined variations across the entire genomes of many people (an approach called genome-wide association studies or GWAS) to determine whether any specific areas of the genome are associated with IQ. These studies have not conclusively identified any genes that underlie differences in intelligence. It is likely that a large number of genes are involved, each of which makes only a small contribution to a person’s intelligence.

Intelligence is also strongly influenced by the environment. Factors related to a child’s home environment and parenting, education and availability of learning resources, and nutrition, among others, all contribute to intelligence. A person’s environment and genes influence each other, and it can be challenging to tease apart the effects of the environment from those of genetics. For example, if a child’s IQ is similar to that of his or her parents, is that similarity due to genetic factors passed down from parent to child, to shared environmental factors, or (most likely) to a combination of both? It is clear that both environmental and genetic factors play a part in determining intelligence.""

In the small town I grew up in, by the early 2000s the stores had long since stopped offering it... except for a handful of existing customers who maintained accounts and had been shopping there for decades. My family - who had been local family farmers since the 1950s - was one of those customers! We moved off the farm in the 90s but continued to shop there and the store let us keep using the farm’s charge account. 

As a teenager (from about 2004-2010) I could walk into the grocery store down the hill from our house and get basically whatever I wanted. At checkout I’d just say the magic words “can I have a charge slip?”. The longtime staff knew the drill, the new seasonal kids would get completely confused before finding the stack of carbon copy paper deep underneath the register. 

I’d write the corporate name of our farm, something like “Flower Creek Farm” (not the real name) and the four digit account number “2147” (that’s the real number!) and sign it. The checker would just stick it in the register slot to print the amount (same way they did with regular checks), toss it in the till, and I’d walk out with my stuff. It was like a magical superpower to a 14 year old. I’m not sure it occurred to me until later that food actually cost money. 

My parents often asked me to grocery shop for them, that’s why they let me use it.

How do any of the numbers that you listed have anything to do with how you compared 2 stock prices? The problem I had was with you comparing a stock price of $1800 to $190, which no one in financing would do.

&gt; The last is the most applicable for market cap valuation. As you can see, AAPL is 16X what AMZN is, but the share price is 1/10th.

You can't just look at one number and declare one stock is better than another. Yes amazon has a VERY VERY low or negative net profit margin, it has been that way for many years. You just repeated that Amazon has a low PE Ratio but didn't look into the reason why their PE ratio is so low. It is because they reinvest all their gross profits in to expansion.

"It was in decline, but not because kerosene was superior. It had an established supply chain, just like gasoline does today, even though there are ""superior"" options. The Civil War brought whaling to a virtual halt. That was the beginning of the end of whale oil. The supply dried up, and kerosene began to make inroads on market share. That allowed it to develop a similar supply chain, so that it gradually out-competed whale oil over a period of time.

It's like gasoline and electric cars. Electric is better by most metrics. But it doesn't have the supply chain behind it. The country hasn't had to develop that supply chain because gasoline is still readily available. Whale oil didn't die a natural, competitive death because it was just worse than kerosene.

 Wouldn't surge protectors, breakers sheilding and fuses do a lot of good in protecting electronics in most cases? "	"Computer Science Major Here: 

We cool modern processors not to make them more efficient, but so that the microchips do not get damaged by excessive heat.   All electronic devices create waste heat based on the wattage of the device.  Do you have a [65W CPU?](https://ark.intel.com/products/88196/Intel-Core-i7-6700-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_00-GHz)  Then you have to dissipate that heat safely via a heat sink (usually aluminum or copper with lots of fins and a fan to move heat from the chip into the air) or maybe a water cooling block (water is circulated through a metal block pressed on the processor, then through a radiator that transfers the heat to the air).  

To 'overclock' a processor doesn't make it more efficient, but makes it faster.  In fact, this often requires that you put *more electricity into the chip than it was designed to carry*.  This causes even more heat to be generated and so even more exotic heat management systems must be used to keep the CPU cool (like a refrigeration system or simply pouring liquid nitrogen directly on the chip).  Think of this as a drag racer vs a Prius.  The drag racer will leave the Prius in the dust, but guzzles gallons of fuel, while the Prius sips ounces.  The Prius is efficient.  The drag racer is fast. 

Wires or traces on a circuit board do gain more resistance as they heat up, meaning that they are slightly worse at transmitting electricity the hotter they are.  But this doesn't really come into effect very much at the temperature that computers operate.  The cooling is there to prevent outright destruction of the chip, not as a means for efficiency.

The last thing to note is that many computers have what's called 'thermal throttling'.  If the system detects it's chips are getting too hot, it will either slow them down (reducing the amount of electricity going through them and thus reducing heat) or completely shut down the system to prevent damage.  This mostly affects laptops (which are thin and have thinner heat sinks and can get dust, hair and junk in their cooling systems from being on your lap, couch or in coffee shops).  This is the only cooling issue that would affect normal users.  It's either working as intended, or slowed down.  Unless you're messing with overclocking, more cooling will not increase performance or efficiency in a noticeable way."	askscience	askscience	-1

2673	"Skinny-armed bearded man here (maybe I should make *that* my flair instead?). There's...a lot to unpack here, so this will be incomplete at best. I would claim that there's something of a fundamental misunderstanding of the field of Logic going on here. I should cover this with ""there is no uncontroversial view in Philosophy of Logic,"" so this is just one lowly practitioner's take on the matter.

There are some massive differences between the practice of Classical Logic today and the practice of the same in the time of Aquinas (let alone Aristotle). Insofar as you are engaging *only* with the Classical Logic of Aristotle and Aquinas, sure, I can agree that you're pointing to some issues. But you're pretty clearly meaning to engage with the contemporary field. Sure, back in the day Logic was taken by many to be a model of thought, but this is quite controversial nowadays (see above). For my part, I take the view that Logic is a language of its own designed specifically to be as precise and unambiguous as possible. From this sort of framework, natural language is what might be called in technical terms ""a goddamned mess."" That doesn't mean that natural language is *wrong*, whatever that would mean, just that the two languages are suited for different purposes.

An important consequence of this is that there is probably no way to get a flawless translation from one to the other - though this is not surprising or even necessarily problematic, given that even natural languages do not perfectly intertranslate - we still take being bilingual to be possible. The status of the Ontological Argument which you obliquely reference is a very good example of this. In terms of contemporary proof, you can get the argument to run, but it proves something rather different than ""(natural language) God exists."" You actually get something along the lines of ""If what we take to be existence behaves as a predicate, and if the notion of maximizing this particular minimal-ish predicate G is coherent, and if we can quantify over nonactualized possibilia, then some being who maximizes this particular minimal-ish predicate G exists."" This is frequently glibly stated ""If 'god' exists, then 'god' exists necessarily.

How is this relevant? Well, within this framework, the three principles you refer to are actually very important for finding a compromise between translatability and precision/nonambiguity. Excluded Middle and Noncontradiction play an important role in defining truth (this is probably my most controversial view in Philosophy of Logic - that most or all axioms of Logic act purely as definitions) that everyone would accept as at least a subset of truth. That is, even the Dialetheist is going to agree that everything defined as true in Classical Logic is, in fact, true. This way, we can at least agree to our theorems. If you wish to have additional truth-values, that's...fine, I guess. I suggest you motivate it more than just ""here's a thing we can, in principle, do,"" and you're talking about a broader notion and putting yourself at risk of being less precise and unambiguous. And you'll have a lot of people disagreeing with you over whether something can possibly be true, unlike when using the truth of the Classical Logician. The law of identity is similar, insofar as it provides a precise definition for ""="" as it applies to the things we talk about in our logic.

There's a claim in this vicinity that the point you are making with respect to Special Relativity is more an issue to do with translation than with Logic itself. There's a large discussion to be had over the status of frames of reference in Logic (are certain truth-values reference-frame-dependent? Is this a problem? Are the sentences that would be reference-frame dependent even sentences that have direct analogues in formal Logic? The list goes on), but it's not obvious that the universe of Special Relativity does not behave in a way that can be modeled with Classical Logic. Debate rages over whether QM can be modeled in Classical Logic (and, if it can't, whether that even poses a problem for what we take Logic to be doing - a lot about our answers to both of these questions will depend on our preferred interpretation of QM, which of course opens and entirely new can of worms).

Anywho, I've rambled on long enough. I feel like this is too disjointed, and it's certainly not as careful as I'd like, but hopefully it communicates roughly what I'm going for. As to your discussion on the unspeakable...I don't think I can engage with that in a way that doesn't (inaccurately) come off as dismissive in the limited time I have. I will simply say that I think you're wrongly putting language prior to thought, and misapplying the claim that any given language has a limit - it does not follow from this that there is some object or such that is outside the limit of all possible languages, or even that there is a limit to the set of all possible languages."

- After cardio in my mind it's ok to eat more beause I did cardio that day even though in my daily intake cardio is already calculated for

- After weightlifting I'm motivated to eat less. In my mind the gains I got will look even better when I stick to my diet

- Eating more protein than other calories. Protein makes me more full and it's longer until I'm hungry again

&gt;I almost want to show up to that birthday party and bring a slice of my wedding cake as a gift.

If you do this, Instagram it.  Because at the very least, she could have attended the ceremony but chose not to do that.  Rude and deserving of shame.

Second:

I married later as well - attended so many wedding showers, baby showers, first birthday parties, recitals, etc.  And from my side, despite sending out Save-the-Dates nearly a year in advance, I had a 60% refusal rate.  Some people claimed they couldn't find babysitters - we're talking people who lived 10 minutes from the venue and invites were sent out 8 weeks ahead of the wedding - some people said they had other plans (and were totally vague about it), and some people didn't even bother RSVPing at all.  I felt bad for my parents because some of these were their family friends, too, for whom they had made the effort to attend wedding for their children.  It felt like an insult.

Guess what?  When it's come to subsequent events in their lives, I've had no problem RSVPing ""No thank you.""  (And so did my parents where it applied to them.) I figure at least I'm giving them the courtesy of an RSVP.  I also knew which friends to value - the friends who would make an effort.

Like many others here, though, I am questioning your Mom's devotion to your sister.  Unless there's some travel involved, there is no reason I can think of that she can't leave her cell phone on vibrate in her purse and keep checking it.  Or even if there is travel, there's no saying she can't just fly in for her other daughter's wedding and then fly right back out.  I get your sister is probably scared and frustrated, and maybe your Mom is trying to make her feel better by not being the only one to miss your wedding...but your Mom is missing your wedding in preference to your sister.  I feel like you should be able to talk to your Mom about this before the day, especially since there's no saying your sister is even going to deliver a month ahead of time."

2693	"&gt;What is wrong with Australian gun policy in your opinion?

Well... I have a lot to say about it, but in general terms I actually think that our gun laws are *roughly* fine, even if they don't serve my *personal* wants and desires. Everything I want is either ""something I would like, but understand is unfeasible"" or a small tweak to the existing laws.

For an example of the first category, I think it should be easier to own semi-automatic rifles. I think they are fun and they have utility for sports, culls, and even for personal interest such as militias, if you're into that. My feelings on this are supported by the gun crime statistics in the US; the vast majority of gun deaths are from handguns, with very few deaths from rifles overall, and even fewer from expensive, military-style weapons, such as AR-15's. However, I accept that there is no political will for this, and if you pardon an expression... this isn't the hill I want to die on.

An example of a small tweak would be reversing our position on suppressors (aka, ""silencers""). Noise pollution and hearing damage are real issues that are often overlooked. Despite what Hollywood will tell you, suppressing a weapon doesn't make it silent; it turns it from ""causes permanent hearing damage on firing"" to ""causes slightly less permanent hearing damage on firing"", especially for rifles. There are some pistols where suppressing them makes them safe to fire without ear-pro, but for most rifles, it just reduces the damage.

There is no way that adding a suppressor to a weapon will turn it into a silent killing machine where someone could walk from room to room killing people without people in adjacent rooms hearing it, like Hollywood might say. [The difference between a suppressed and non-suppressed AR-15 is very little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuS9XnY-IRA), and if you watched this video in a different tab, only listening to it, it would be difficult to tell which shots are suppressed and which are not. There's a difference, but it's not much. You'll notice, for example, that even with the suppressor attached, the shooter in this video is still wearing ear-pro.

I have other thoughts but that's basically two things."

2701	The burden is that the answer is unknown and theists say that they know the answer, thus for this to be accepted as true there needs to be proof.

"Take a universe that has 3 objects. Then it necessary has also 2 objects. In that case the descriptor (IF there is N objects there is also N-1 objects) describes something that is unavoidable. What is the case (existence of 3 objects) necessarily causes the thing described (also 2 objects).

The laws we have discussed are like this. They describe something that necessarily follows from what is or is missing.

If there is a symmetry, then there is unavoidably a conservation law. The symmetry makes the conservation law unavoidable.

So there isn't some additional cause that is missing.

The Feds via FCC basically said its not the federal governments place to manage ISPs. But any area they relinquish authority over can be taken up by the states. And since ISPs by their nature are local, even if the company is national, the local government will have a lot of say in this.

Which, honestly, is where the solution should be anyway as its where the problem came from anyway.

Con artists, quacks, crazy people and religious zealots *(i know, i could have just said religious zealots :) )* are well known for attempting to borrow the very tangible and real results of the scientific method to justify their baseless assertions.

It's an attempt to borrow credit without doing deserving it.  Like when you work hard at your business and your boss gets the bonus by claiming credit for it.  He is relying on his audience (his boss) not knowing any better, as is your mother.  Luckily, you can see through her BS.

&gt;  Literally every decision made has to be somehow in accordance to the scripture.

Well good news: you can justify any position on any topic by quoting a bible verse.  It doesn't even have to have anything to do with the topic or position at hand; you just need to employ rampant speculation with a straight face.  If you need any ideas, look at biblical prophecy.

Then the price comes tumbling down, and the headlines go away, and some of the people who paid attention go back to ignoring it. 

But not all of them. Some of them become believers, and go on to contribute to Bitcoin Core, and start Bitcoin businesses, and successfully lobby their companies to get involved.

2764	"&gt;How is blaming ""both sides"" for a terrorist attack and calling the attackers ""very fine people"" justifying it?

A mentally unstable person running someone over with a car is not a terrorist attack.

Just like someone braining another person with a maglite is not a terrorist attack.

Slow your roll. Breathe.

&gt;Is killing people worse than hurting them?
&gt;Uh, yes. Literally everywhere says that murder is worse than assault.

If the intent was equally malicious, then the outcome is just aesthetics. 

To my mind, someone who is pretty clearly not right in the head freaking out and driving into a crowd is at *worst* as bad as hitting someone in the head with a maglite.

To put this in perspective - it'd be like getting smashed with a small crowbar. In the head. Is that terrorism? I don't think so. It's also pretty fucking awful.

&gt; Terrorism that kills people is worse than terrorism that doesn't, but the baseline is still terrorism.

So we are agreeing.... that ""both sides"" are to blame here, then?

Since there were terrorists who killed people on one side, and terrorists who didn't on the other?

&gt;Hahaha, ""kid"". 20 year old man, called a ""kid"".

I mean, I would refer to myself as a kid when I was 20.

I was incredibly immature and did not have a bit more than a decade of living on my own under my belt enough to have nuance or any kind of perspective.

Yes. I consider a 20 year old a kid.

Oh look, you're a bigot, to boot. Not surprising that you'd project, given all these assumptions you just made about me.

Let me guess. You think I voted for Trump, am a conservative and probably secretly hate black people?

Maybe you're a kid, too. But I won't presume, because I'm not a stereotyping asshole.

&gt;No, they don't. Nothing justifies his terrorism.

Uh.... did I say they did?

Two things can happen and be independent of one another.

How, you ask?

THING ONE - local politicians shit the bed and let a counter-protesting mob loose on the streets, surrounding the area where the original protest was occurring despite not being permitted. Cops could have stopped it but were instructed not to. 

THING TWO - After the protest is over, someone who was a counter protester is struck and killed by a vehicle driven by a mentally unstable person who was a part of the protest. 

It's OK to be mad that someone is dead because they got hit by a car in the road while also wondering at the screw-ups that led to them being in the road to begin with. 

That's called nuance.

Why is the story not about mental health in this country, once you absorb the fact of an innocent death? Oh, right - the kid was on the ""bad guys team."" Way easier to shit on him and his team than actually do something that matters for a change.

&gt;Nothing justifies this terrorist attack from these people, no matter how much you try to pretend it does.

So let's play a game.

Let's assume the kid actually DOES have mental problems. Like, a severe personality disorder where he really should have been in therapy more, maybe on meds, probably not driving, etc.

HYPOTHETICALLY if that were true, and he was experiencing an episode when this happened, would you still be labeling him a terrorist?

At my advanced age now I feel it's a little easier, but for instance it took me years to kill the habit of overusing adverbs and other modifiers (my favorite writer Gogol did that), but the thing I love about writing is that it's an ongoing process and you always have to keep getting better and learning new things.

2773	"Anti-Vax and Flat Earth are easily disprovable using scientific inquiry.

Your statement ""Temasek Holdings have never made a single cent"" is a strawman argument. I don't know anyone who claims that Temasek Holdings has never made a single cent. There are several claims against Temasek Holdings

1. The financial reports are ownself-check-ownself. Lack of accountability except to the BOD. Generally this is viewed as a conflict of interest. 

2. The opaqueness of the reporting allows the company to present data selectively. It also leads to a possibility of private parties with knowledge of Temasek operations benefiting from decisions made  using public money

3. The big one in my opinion is the contentiousness of whether Temasek is using ""public money"". The reason why most people feel it is public money is that from it's inception it was given the assets previously managed by the Singapore government. The Singapore government got these assets by taxation of the general public.

4. Those that believe that Temasek is using public funds, believe there should be transparency, or at least a disclosure after a couple of years for accountability's sake - especially for example if Temasek invests in a company, but as a introductory fee, a family member gets a couple shares at a discount.

These are totally different examples - how can you conflate what is obviously a scientific fallacy, with something that it is worth having a debate over."	Sorry for the late response.

In my personal case, the enabler in my family didn't have all the usual traits, the biggest one was their ability to be wrong and actually apologize, but they were still so depended on my NPD mother.

Given the tumultuous ups and downs of BPD it would make sense like with any abusive relationship to often seek out another one as it's familiar.

I'm pretty sure my mother was covert NPD, she had the martyr role. She did not at all live in reality.Do you have the paper that specifically talks about inverted narcissists per chance?

If he did not plan/""intend"" for me to raise my right hand, I wouldn't have done it. He did not control me to take that action, but it was still all part of the plan. Everything would be part of the plan, because he planned everything. I am in control of myself, but my actions were still intended to happen and planned for. Do you know why he could do that? Because he's omniscient and omnipotent. It has everything to do with being all-powerful and all-knowing. If my actions weren't intended, then he is not all-powerful/knowing. If he is not all-powerful/knowing, then he could not have intended my or anyone else's actions, and would not be worth talking about.

And so as to not stray off-topic, I'll re-iterate my first and primary question: What reasons do you have to believe that your first comment is true? The comment that I asked you to put into your own words."	As an atheist, I think, if you are to be a Christian, you should be a Christian because of the moral structures and communities which you take part in that you feel benefit you. If you don’t feel like this is a good enough justification, or you feel like the morals and community negatively affect you, or you feel that the religion is false and this is unbearable to you (as did I), I would not be a Christian.

Like, no one wants to divorce if they can help it and, for women especially, there can be such judging if you get divorced, like you're so bad you couldn't even keep the guy willing to marry you and you failed at one of the easiest things to do in life. It's not easy, though. People get married because they think it'll be easy or they get married to ""fix"" an issue, when marriage is hard work and it will not fix anything. If you've got issues, it's best to avoid marriage until you can fix them... IF you can fix them. Marriage is such a commitment. And if kids come into the picture, too. And, while I don't care a lot about marriage, I know it's good for legal/tax reasons and, unfortunately or fortunately, you can never tell when someone will die or something happens and you need to be legally related to do something.

I'm worried about people/guys who also are afraid of marriage and divorce, in general. I feel like it's often commitment issues or because they believe all the stories men tell (who didn't really want to get married, but got married anyway) about how horrible marriage will be. Marriage is only horrible if you marry the wrong person/for the wrong reason, like you got pregnant or the family was pressuring you because you're getting older or you settled because you thought you could never get anyone else. And divorce fear is often because men think the women are going to take everything they've got, so they'll stay in a horrible marriage to avoid that.

Linking it is exactly the opposite of bad economics.  It is directly making the users pay for the true (formerly socialized) cost of using fossil fuels. "	"As there's a soft paywall.

&gt;In expensive cities, rents fall for the rich — but rise for the poor

&gt;U.S. cities struggling with soaring housing costs have found some success in lowering rents this year, but that relief has not reached the renters most at risk of losing their housing.

&gt;Nationally, the pace of rent increases is beginning to slow down, with the average rent in at least six cities falling since last summer, according to Zillow data.

&gt;But the decline is being driven primarily by decreasing prices for high-end rentals. People in low-end housing, the apartments and other units that house working-class residents, are still paying more than ever.

&gt;Since last summer, rents have fallen for the highest earners while increasing for the poorest in San Francisco, Atlanta, Nashville, Chicago, Philadelphia, Denver, Pittsburgh, Washington and Portland, Ore., among other cities. In several other metro areas — including Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston and Miami — rents have risen for the poor and the rich alike.

&gt;The ongoing increase in prices for low-end renters poses a challenge for city officials who have vowed to lower housing costs for working-class residents already struggling with tepid wage growth in the U.S. economy.

&gt;City officials have said a boom in luxury housing construction would cause rents to fall for everyone else, arguing that creating new units for those at the top would ease competition for cheaper properties.

&gt;In part based on that theory, cities have approved thousands of new luxury units over the past several years, hoping to check high rents that have led more than 20 million American renters to be classified as “cost burdened,” defined as spending more than 30 percent of one’s income on housing.

&gt;But although some advocates say the dividends could still pay off for low-income renters, others say more direct government action is needed to prevent poor residents from being forced out of their cities or into homelessness. They have called for the federal government to help construct more affordable units, or offer greater rental assistance for poor families.

&gt;“For-profit developers have predominantly built for the luxury and higher end of the market, leaving a glut of overpriced apartments in some cities,” said Diane Yentel, president and chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group. “Some decision-makers believed this would ‘filter down’ to the lowest income people, but it clearly will not meet their needs.”

&gt;Poorer city residents have experienced significant rent increases over the past several years. In Portland, average rents for the poor have risen from about $1,100 to $1,600 — or by more than 40 percent — since 2011.

&gt;In San Francisco, the average rent at the bottom of the market has soared from $1,700 to $2,600, a nearly 50 percent increase. Seattle’s poor have also had their rents rise by close to 40 percent. Nationwide, rents for those at the bottom have increased by 18 percent.

&gt;Rising rents for the poor threaten to add to the nation’s homeless population, and put an additional severe strain on tens of millions of families, often forcing them to forgo other basic needs to avoid losing their housing.

&gt;Construction in most U.S. cities came to a standstill during the Great Recession, amid a broader collapse in the housing market. As the economic recovery took off, its gains were disproportionately concentrated in a handful of cities, leading renters to move in droves to already densely populated urban areas.

&gt;There was not enough housing there to greet them. By the early 2010s, rents in major cities were beginning to increase by more than 10 percent annually. Several cities declared emergencies over their rising homeless populations.

&gt;In the following years, protracted battles have occurred in city halls nationwide over the size and makeup of urban communities, often pitting longtime homeowners trying to preserve the value of their properties against developers seeking to profit from the high demand.

&gt;Mayors have been caught in the middle, aiming to accommodate an influx of new residents who help boost the local economy without displacing those who have lived in their cities for decades. They have also faced intense pressure from influential developers and business groups that have pressed for the ability to develop new homes, as well as from landlords who enjoy high rents and fear seeing those values diluted.

&gt;The result has been a range of policy measures, including reforming zoning codes to encourage more development, creating new tools to finance affordable housing projects and rules mandating that developers include affordable units in their properties.

&gt;These measures have shown some signs of reducing rents, for both the rich and, to a lesser extent, the middle class.

&gt;For renters in the middle third of the income distribution, average rental prices have remained virtually unchanged since last summer, according to the Zillow data. Rents over the past year have also fallen slightly for the middle class of renters in Portland, Chicago, Philadelphia and Seattle.

&gt;The lack of affordable housing can be particularly pronounced in smaller cities such as Portland, which has struggled to accommodate about 40,000 new residents since 2010.

&gt;From 2010 to 2014, the city built only a few hundred affordable housing units, according to a city report. Since 2014, more than 95 percent of private construction in the city has been in “the luxury end of the market,” said Nick Fish, a city commissioner.

&gt;Private housing construction has exploded in Portland’s downtown area, along its south waterfront and in its historically black northeast community. But even as the city’s population has ballooned, its black population has decreased since 2014 by an average of 800 people every year, probably pushed out by gentrification, according to a study by Portland State University researchers.

&gt;In an email, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) pointed to 948 affordable rental units expected to open in 2018 and an additional 978 units scheduled for 2019. “We are actively creating housing options at every income level in every area of the city,” he said, adding that 10,000 more units are coming soon. “Our efforts are beginning to pay off: This will be the largest number of affordable units ever produced by the City of Portland in a single year in modern history.”

&gt;But for Rakhelya Levitskaya, a 66-year-old home-care aide who works with the elderly and disabled, little help appears to be on the way. A Ukrainian immigrant who has lived in the same Portland housing complex for 18 years, Levitskaya received notice of an approximately 10 percent rent increase this summer that she fears will push her into homelessness.

It is very incorrect. We know that stars (and therefore, light) formed first - not the earth. The Genesis account specifically says there was darkness over the earth and God created light.

Just think about it logically, can you actually prove that the purple invisible elephant doesn’t exist? Like seriously prove to me it doesn’t exist and isn’t floating above you right now...

To entertain your question here is my answer: There was never evidence to say god does exist. Why am I trying to disprove something to you that was never proved in the first place? How *can* you disprove something that was never proved? And no, I don’t think we would end up at the same place. I wouldn’t have anything to prove since I’m not making any claim? The religious person would begin trying to prove god’s existence through normal religious examples (miracles, complexity of life, etc.)

The burden of proof isn’t a cop out, it’s a method that’s used to determine if the claims a party has made can be backed up or proved. If people are going to make claims, then they need to be backed up and the burden of backing it up lies on the person making the claim. 

The issue, is that religion is so tied into our lives, that people are literally born with the belief that religion and gods are already accepted as “proven”.

Consulted and informed, yes, but the decision should rest with professionals who have access to the data on outcomes, contraindications etc. Parents don’t get a rule book on how to be parents, and some are better than others. We need to look at the greater good alongside the potential benefits to the individual child outweighing possible harms to said child. Parents have enough info to absorb and learn, we shouldnt require that they get a medical degree level knowledge about vaccinations too. Although I do think they should be taught about the potential for unvaccinated kids to carry, pass on and endanger children who cannot be vaccinated a lot more thoroughly. I’m sure it’s not something anyone wants to be responsible for, endangering an already compromised child by accident, possibly killing them even.

If the rising income and wealth inequality from the Reagan-Thatcher era drives the rise in unhappiness, one would expect that happiness would change without respect to gender. Instead, men's happiness gradually increased while women's has gone down. It is clear that other factors are involved, possibly social factors outside of the realm of economics."

People get wrongfully banned.  We have seen Anet make false, incomplete statements, or totally just duck what is actually happening.  I used to be a staunch believer in Anets effectiveness.  But these things do happen.  I have experienced it first hand, and its a well documented occurrence.

People also get rightfully banned and create PR drama here on Reddit.  Anet often comes out here to defend itself, really, because if they do not, people assume the worst about them, and their side of the story is never heard.  Leaving them at the mercy of someone that is upset about being banned is they don't.

Everyone has their own assumptions and experiences.  These things should not be handled in a public display, it is not healthy for the community. It just invites people to create drama.  But at the same time, reddit should not be a place where people have to go to get a final appeal for someone to actually take a look at their account.  Customer service seems to be 3rd party, they have guidelines to follow and quotas to meet.  It is defiantly not 100% full proof.

In this case, if the lesson is getting women to realize that men don't them friendship just like women don't owe men relationships, the flip side of that should be men realizing that it's important for them to be straightforward with women regarding their lack of interest in friendship.

I would argue that you are trying to be the “unfair” player here. I use that term loosely in this instance because that is a viable strategy. However so is instant speed removal. It’s what keeps things like a turn one elf from turning into a three drop on turn two, potential for a five drop on turn three if you played another dork. All things in this game keep something else in check.  You created an impressively low-effort post about how “unfair” shock is. You need to re-evaluate your understanding of this game. It sounds like you are a very new player, and that is fine. I encourage you to learn more and enjoy the game for what it is.

Correlation does not equal causation.

At most it should show that marriage with a women is more likely to end in death than two men marrying.

12 What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? 13 God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”

As I understand it, homosexual sexual thoughts/actions are sinful just like heterosexual sexual thoughts/actions outside of marriage (or indeed inside a marriage when they put lust over God). A Christian should be able to discern this from the Bible and try to apply it to their lives, not by their own power but by asking God for strength.

2937	Sakura becomes discount tsunade at 16/17 years old. She is amazing . That stuffs she did requires more practice and hard work than most stuffs. And im sure she wouldve been able to learn mobility techniques to compliment her raw strength and maybe some long range and CC jutsus. She had the most improvement after time skip. Sasuke probably went from 4.5/10 to 8.5/10. Naruto from 4/10 to 6.5/10 .sakura went from 0.5/10 to 7/10. Sakura improved 6.5 points. And yes, sakura is a stronger and more reliable shinobi than naruto right after timeskip. What she lacks was only mobility, range, CC and experience. While she was a sure one hit KO, healer, has massive regens and chakra (the forehead thing), summon, intelligence. Naruto was a loose canon.

My favourite game was one where you were a balloon and you had to avoid being popped. Back then you had two options for games. You could buy them on a cassette tape or cartridge. Alternatively you could buy a book with the code in it and type it all out yourself. There were also computer clubs where you could go and borrow games to record onto your own cassette tapes.

2970	"&gt;Michael Kimmel’s new book, “Healing From Hate: How Young Men Get Into — and Out of — Violent Extremism,” is about young men who find a purpose in the unlikeliest places. If you’ve ever wondered why nearly all the people you read about who are joining the Islamic State or neo-Nazi groups or the white-nationalist alt-right are men, Kimmel contends it’s no coincidence: He believes that gender, specifically masculinity, is both “the psychological inspiration” that sends young men into these groups “and the social glue that keeps them involved.”

Masculinity is the original sin in the Church of the Divine Feminine.

But they don't like that rotten old Bible in which the original sinner was a woman.

And women don't have to engage in violence to carry out their ideology. Feminists now have the government to carry out violence on their behalf because the promised land of feminism is totalitarianism.

&gt;Among other things, Kimmel uses his unusual access to “formers” (people who have left these movements) to reveal the process of radicalization. Ingo Hasselbach, who founded a program called EXIT Deutschland, recounts how he once drew young men into the neo-Nazi movement. “I liked to approach fourteen to sixteen year-olds after school,” he tells Kimmel. “The first thing I did when I met one of these boys was to show him that I wanted to be his friend, to hang out with him, which, coming from someone older, especially someone over twenty, was a real compliment. I’d act a lot like an older brother; we’d go into the woods together and do things like Boy Scout exercises, building forts and making trails. I’d always slip in a bit of ideology against foreigners along the way.”

Sort of like how Ernest Roehm (founder of the Sturmabteilung) liked to slip away with the young boys and teach them all about how to be a Nazi. His 'mentoring' of the handsome, young Aryan men is what got him liquidated during Operation Hummingbird.

Never trust people who romanticize or valorize youth over wisdom.

&gt;Hasselbach said they’d look at maps of Europe from 1937 and talk about the land that was “stolen” from Germany, and over the course of many conversations they would sow the seeds of victimhood and what Kimmel calls “aggrieved entitlement.”

Sort of like how feminists claim that 'muh Patriarchy' stole all female agency since time began? 

It's as if victimhood and identitarianism can only lead to bad outcomes, especially if you are in an out-group from the Sacred Victims...

&gt;Kimmel does a good job laying out the events that lead men to violence, and the trajectory seems standard. They are people who have endured humbling setbacks: lost jobs, difficulty in school, family issues. Kimmel makes the case that rather than look inside themselves for the source of this misfortune, these men find fault with the system, or immigrants, or unseen outside forces conspiring to keep them down.

Re-write this paragraph and see how it reads:

""Kimmel does a good job laying out the events that lead WOMEN to FEMINISM, and the trajectory seems standard. They are people who have endured humbling setbacks: lost jobs, difficulty WITH MEN, family issues. Kimmel makes the case that rather than look inside themselves for the source of this misfortune, these WOMEN find fault with the system, or MEN, or unseen outside forces conspiring to keep them down.""

2974	Why would he reveal any internal issues with the people, that would just be a low blow and create more drama for them. With an attitude like hers I wouldn't be one bit surprised if she brought some of that into the office. 	"So a few months ago anet introduced new rules to PvP to try and balance comps between teams more closely. On paper this sounded like a great idea to most of the community even though I was against it from the start. Why?  

Classes are not relegated to roles as with other PvP games.  

Take my last game.  

Our team comp consisted of a longbow power ranger, a burst power guardian and a holosmith.  
On the opposite and mirrored side they were bunker druid, firebrand support and scrapper support.  

As you can imagine the amount of sustain on their side was impossible to compete with or outdps in most fights. We were forced to rotate around them and all they needed to do was stall for time on 2 caps.  
It was a slow methodical loss despite the team trying their best to get around this impossibly tanky composition.  

The rule that made this possible is the same one that people were asking for for years. It was never a good and idea and unless each class is relegated to only a specific role it will never be a good idea. The randomness was better than we have now.  
Build diversity is in a good place. But the class mirroring is hurting that build diversity because running an offmeta build is even more painful than before even though the builds themselves are competitive.  

I would like to see this change reverted.  "	Guildwars2	Guildwars2	-1
2975	I commute to Evanston from Chicago, for work.  There are a lot of ways to get there and I can usually have some fun optimizing my path as much as possible.  Also practicing unnecessary heel toe (well actually ball / blade) downshifts and hooning a little.  Traffic sucks but you can still drive actively.	My number one criteria was that the car has to look good in blue and either only have or look like it has 2 doors. Hence why I drive a grabber blue mustang. IMO the blue c-hr is gorgeously, I think it is one of the best blue cars. After only the grabber blue mustang and the bright blue wrangler 	cars	cars	-1

2979	"For me it got worse in university because the dissection became even more thorough and damaging to the work, and the amount of compulsory material made reading even more contrived. The reading lists were great, but that makes it worse. Sacrificing books that you wouldn't have cared for anyway isn't so bad.

Thank god I decided to stop early or I would have ruined so many great books for myself, and the scholarly approach to reading literature would have become more difficult to shake. 

Now I love books again."	"Here is my unpopular opinion

Isn't this a story that was created in his imagination ? and hence it is his story to tell. Many authors write books because they want to tell their story  and they do it in their own way. Some may write them very quickly and others slowly. I can understand that the fans want to know what happens next ,  but for that to happen he has to write it how he wants to. Otherwise it will be another book written just for continuing the series and not how  he wanted it to be written. He may want to add many plots that he imagined and may want to do it in a suitable way.

If you wanna get into more serious games you could upgrade the graphics card in the future if the power supply allows for it 	"I hear a lot of people telling you to overclock your CPU, don't. That particular board has a hard enough time handling any of the 8 core FX series at stock, nevermind the extra voltage required for a moderate overclock. 

Temps are HIGH (68c), and very close to thermal limit (~72c) and would explain the 2.05Ghz boost (your CPU is running at half speed). Clean your computer and CPU heatsink and let the chip breathe. That will alleviate the CPU bottleneck you're experiencing. 

If gaming is your number one priority, dump your budget into a new GPU, and start saving for a platform upgrade (CPU, RAM, MOBO), while you can do this now with 600, your itsy bitsy GPU will show no noticeable improvement in games (and if it does, it will be improved frametimes, not more FPS)

Why? There are bigger acquisitions happening all over right now. 

This would be the biggest purchase in the history of gaming (I believe) but outside of that context it's not all that different, especially in the tech industry. Even if we look at it in the context of other entertainment industry takeovers it's not the biggest (might not even be top 10 if you consider inflation). Hell Disney just bought Fox for $52 billion. If Microsoft acquired EA for $34 billion (its market capitalization) it would be a large acquisition but not all that insane for Microsoft really. Remember it attempted to buy Yahoo for $48 billion in the late 2000s. It bought LinkedIn for $28 billion a few years ago.

The timing could be right for Microsoft and EA as well. EA is getting a lot of bad press (nothing company dooming, but it hasn't been good for years now), but EA also has a lot of high profile IP and contracts to IP (Star Wars, FIFA, Madden). Investors might be willing to let go at this point given the continued bad press and potential hit to their games (I believe Battlefront 2 undersold?).

What are you working on? 

[2019 Winter Rust Sign Up](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/9jx2d2/gunnit_rust_summer_rust_2018_results_and_2019/)

GUNNIT Rust Contest Date is March 24. 

**Explanation**

GUNNIT RUST IS A GUN BUILDING CONTEST! YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO BUILD AND SUBMIT YOUR OWN HANDIWORK. WE ALLOW PNEUMATIC GUNS BECAUSE OF OPPRESSIVE REGIONS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIERS FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS. THIS HAPPENS TWICE A YEAR. THIS NEXT CONTEST DATE IS **MARCH 24** IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ASK THEM! OTHERWISE, SEE YOU ON MARCH 24th.

**Current Rules:**  
The rules and tiers are minimal for maximum creativity  

 * No Kabooms  
 * No breaking the law  
 * Pneumatic guns allowed because of laws.  
 * .25acp energy is more or less the bottom goal but not super enforced.  
 * Submit on the contest date titles ""Gunnit Rust: Title Goes Here"" So Coyote can find it easily and link it to the official contest thread in a comment.  

**Participation Tiers**

* Tier I **Built Gun (or Suppressor)** Basically, you build a gun from non-gun components. We have allowed commercial gun springs and barrels(or Barrel Liners) for safety but if you have the skills, doing your own is mad props. The rules are pretty arbitrary and you can convert pellet guns, toys, or flare guns etc. Note that I have included suppressors in this tier assuming you form your own baffles.
* Tier II **complete built receivers, uppers, and 80% receivers** with commercial parts This is where all the 80% receivers, re welds, and parts kits on built or substantially modified receivers would go. Again a winner by Karma and I encourage people to favor the guys doing more work. Note the change for built upper. By built upper I mean you made an upper from sheet metal plates and an MP5 forend or something.

* Tier IV **Trusty Rusty** Tier Best resurrection of a dead, neglected gat. If your region frowns upon gun building maybe you can play too be turning a rusty hung of broken down garbage into something function and ready to again be loved.
* Tier V **Modified Guns** Fat kid just want to play too? Did you glue a rail to your 1911? Bless your heart. We actually had a .460 Rowland Glock conversion do very well in Summer Rust 2015 Personally I'd like to see some handmade wood furniture dress ups.

In all honesty the glock/s&amp;w/Springfield debate is stupid. 

I went to a range and fired a g17/19 an xdm 3.8 compact and an M&amp;P 9. The glocks ergonomics have never been for me even though I’ve always really *wanted* them too because it’s a fucking glock. I didn’t shoot as well with either at the time. Moved on to the M&amp;P and it felt great in the hand but that trigger felt like it had dirty toilet paper in it. 

Got to the xdm and everything was right. 

That’s what I bought. I’ve put about 3k rounds through with all types of ammo and haven’t had a problem. My grip safety hasn’t ever been an issue and with a stealthgear holster it disappears with the 13 round mag.

3023	"&gt; Not quite. The plant does not weigh options and then select the one that is ranked higher in it's preferences.

I don't see what difference this makes if our weighing of options is merely determined by prior sufficient conditions. Then our ""rational weighing of options"" is merely a series of events each one in the series determining the next and something outside of our control determining the first event which determines the rest. This is acting according to reason by happenstance not acting for any reason at all.

Acting for a reason means having a rational power which responds to reasons (non-random, controlled) and spontaneous (undetermined). That seems to me to be what distinguishes agents from mere mechanism like a plant or conscious non-rational agents like squirrels.

The difference between doing something *because* of a reason and *for* a reason is that in the former you're merely a mechanism where as when you act *for* a reason the reasons do not function as causes but the agent acts *in light of* the reasons."

I like the [Xtar VC4](https://www.illumn.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=vc4) charger for good charging performance, informative LCD display, together with green/red LEDs charging/done indicators, and 1Ax1-2slot charging. It also does .5Ax1-4slots whenever you use a center slot. It needs 2.1A of USB power for max charge current.

3026	"Exactly. I didn't think I'd ever have it in me to hurt someone's pet until I lived next to asshole neighbors who were never home and left their dogs outside for 8-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. One of them in particular would bark for hours on end at nothing. A few weeks after moving in, I went next door to talk to them and got a polite version of ""fuck off, we don't care"" and nothing changed. I tried speaking with them a second time, and even left a letter on their door explaining that their dogs barked constantly when they were gone and that I just wanted them to show some basic neighborly courtesy. Still nothing. So I called my local police. They don't respond to dog noise complaints, even though there's a local noise ordinance specifically about barking dogs. I tried animal control as well, and they don't deal with it either. Ultimately, I tried one of those anti-barking sonic devices and it mitigated the noise significantly enough that I got my sanity back, but if that hadn't worked? I'm not sure what I'd have done.

So imagine yourself in my situation. Your neighbors are uncooperative. The authorities are useless. The dogs are still barking for hours every day, denying you a moment's peace and even ruining the quiet moments because they leave you on edge waiting for the next time they start up again. How long would you last before you started contemplating doing something drastic just so you could have something as simple as a quiet moment in your own home?

The rest go to overhead like building matinence, equipment, paying managers, r&amp;d, rent, insurance and of course profit. So in the restaurant the food cost and labor cost is known as controllables. You can control how much you pay people and you can control not wasting food. So if we would pay the wait staff double, which is minimum wage, since they become non tipped employees we will end up at around 30 percent labor. So how do we control this change in labor While keeping this business afloat? Charge more money for the food because we can only take half of the sales to put towards these two things.  By charging more for the food we can make up for the change in labor cost. 	"Where you go to college does not necessarily define how smart you are.

3050	"Consider the convenience price. We considered switching in the past and this is the reason we did not. The expendable water filters, minerals, and CO2 all cost; so does the bottled water, but the difference is I can buy the latter at the grocery store. There is also an up-front cost to purchase the equipment -- which is not available at the grocery store. The bottled water is instantly available with no work from me, while I need to wait and plan ahead for a drink made at home. I can throw a 9L pack of water in my car and never purchase a drink away from home. It is far less likely that I will diligently take my single reusable bottle of homemade water with me everywhere I go, nor is it likely that it will hold enough. This is even less practical for my husband due to the realities of his job. 

Furthermore, we don't own our home, we can't install a permanent fancy system. The kind of filters you can use in a pitcher all come in loads of plastic anyway, and I sincerely doubt they're more environmentally efficient on a per-liter basis than the mass filtration the bottling plant would use. To buy these filters, we need to drive 45min away from home! It sounded attractive to us too, but when you consider the practicalities it gets more and more ridiculous. We're not going to switch for now. It may make more sense after our next move, especially if we get stuck somewhere without recycling again.

Why do you think Google is the same type of company as companies in the pharmaceutical industry? Are the perfect? No. They are a business and they are concerned with making money. But they don't have nearly the same history as ""Big Pharma"" and they offer entirely different services. They have big competitors others can choose to go to. They have a more front facing company where their public image and brand are more important to keep positive. 

The pharmaceutical industry and healthcare has been broken for so long that it's allowed ""Big Pharma"" to fester into what it is. The tech industry is far younger, and while it does have it's problems, they aren't anywhere close to the pharmaceutical industry.

That's a lot of time to harden the product and provide more features. The rule of thumb I've heard, for AWS services at least, is to wait a year for the major kinks to be ironed out before using it for production. If they're dead-set on using a managed Kubernetes service for a production environment GKE currently is the best choice from a practical point of view. This of course may change in the next couple of years, as Microsoft is pushing Kubernetes hard and wants to give GKE a run for its money, especially as they're also pushing into the app/container orchestration space with Service Fabric.

While I don't have experience with GKE, I've been using AKS for a couple of weeks now in dev setups and there's definitely quite a few issues here and there that will eventually be fixed but show hallmarks of a service still maturing -- e.g., no ability to change the SPN on the cluster, weird issues with helm deployment failures due to mounted disks not attaching in time, [this stupid ""feature""](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/issues/3).

Every paycheck withholds a certain amount to automatically go to taxes.  But that withholding rate assumes you get that paycheck every pay cycle.

But then at the end of the year you file your taxes and report your actual income.  You figure out your real total taxes owed, compare it to what was withheld, and then either pay the difference or receive a refund if the government withheld too much.

3070	"I'm not sure I can say a whole bunch that would help, but I've got a couple things I think!

When things look bleak for me and I lose that kind of trusting feeling, I usually do a couple things that have helped me. The number one thing is prayer. Casting all anxieties and fears on the Lord in prayer really helps. Be honest in what you're struggling with and just talk to Him about what's going on and what you want. Quiet time alone in prayer does wonders.

Read Scripture! Genesis 39 and on (Joseph's story) is something I've read and thought about that was nice when I was struggling trusting in His plan. Book of Job is always a good one too, one of my favorite books in the Bible (maybe not quite what you're looking for, but still). The Old Testament stories are great for seeing how God works in people's lives, I've found. And of course, don't just read them but really think about them as well. The Psalms tend to be very comforting as well.

This one may sound a bit cheesy, but I like to surrond myself with Christian media. Listening to worship music and other Christian music is nice, maybe watch some movies (not all of them are bad, actually!), listening to sermons and things like that are great for me in filling my mind with positivity and trust and praise. 

Hope some of that helped! "	"Good question and I believe I have an answer for it, I’ll do my best but this isn’t a point I’ve heard anyone else bring up before. Before I’d like to say that the law the part of the Bible I talked about in my last comment didn’t refer to the law as in Ten Commandments and such, it rendered more to morality given by God.

Firstly he didn’t do it this way because that’s not what me created us for, he created us for him, to know him and be known by him. We are his children.

Second, more people will be saved this way I believe. The path to heaven without knowing about Jesus is more strict than the path through Jesus. That way you are still judged for your sins and must have payed for them all. Through Jesus though you are not judged for you sins, they are forgiven completely. Anyone can go to heaven through Jesus regardless of their past where as without him your soul must not be tarnished by evil. By accepting Jesus you also accept the Holy Spirit and it is the Holy Spirit that over time makes your soul perfect. The point of this so when heaven is created here on earth there will be no evil or pain or suffering like there is here now.

Also fun fact about the law (referring to Ten Commandments type law), that wasn’t given to us so we (people in general) could follow them and make it to heaven that way. That law was given to us to humble us and show us that we are sinners and we need to seek forgiveness from God, it was given to us to show us our need of a savior."	Christianity	Christianity	-1

Correct, taking this into account makes it much more likely that all of these Houses remained in power for so long.

Here's one example in actual history where things happened differently. King Philip III of France (House Capet)'s second surviving son, Charles, became Count of Valois and formed the House of Valois. His own son, the future Philip VI, would become King of France in 1328 due to the succession crisis that caused the Hundred Years Wars.

When Philip VI took the throne, the House of Valois became the royal house, but Philip VI was simply Philip III's grandson through his son Charles. Had that happened in ASOIAF, the royal House would have remained House Capet.

Fuck Tim Tebow was better at slinging the rock than KB and won a playoff game for the broncos and isn't in the league. Tajh was a much better QB than Bryant and he's out of a job, he isn't even a backup. Who knows why those guys like McGloin are still in the league is a mystery, but its just a long shot to think that he'd learn a new playbook and start for a team desperate enough for a one year QB play well enough to get NFL looks as a QB and ontop of it all stay in the league. He'd have the good looking combine numbers and measurements teams would want out of a TE or WR, teams carry multiple TEs and WRs which at least gives him a higher probability to make a roster spot competing for 3-4 spots rather than 1-2. He knows the playbook here and he has the tools as an athlete to possibly make it at that position, but I don't know of any NFL GM who is looking at KB as a prospect at QB.

It was equipped with GPS locator which led them straight to its location which was an apartment complex.

The shooting took place on the 22nd.  After the shooting, the key fob to the BMW was found in Reinking's apartment during the search linking him to the car theft.  So, no, Reinking didn't use the BMW to evade the police for 34 hours.  It probably would have been better if he actually had the BMW at the time because it was equipped with a GPS locator.

Your name isn't the only thing that can be used to connect the data with your person. That's why everything has to be deleted.

&gt; Any cases that resulted in a guilty verdict should be exempt from right to deletion. Citizens have a right to know what crimes have been committed and the news should have a right to spread that information.

Only if the person effected or the crime is of public interest. If the crimes of every citizen are public, there's no privacy and no rehabilitation. In countries, where the people take privacy more seriously, like Germany, the crime record of a person is a thing between the person and the state and no one else. The publication of mug shots in the US is seen as barbaric, here.

&gt; And the biggest and most complex one of all. Who has the right to collect what data for how long

What? Complex? No, this is very simple. Anyone that has explicit consent by the person, whose data is collected, as long as they state the reason for collecting the data and for the duration that this reason is valid/the data is necessary. This has been the law here in Germany for a long time.

&gt; Really this whole law should be thoroughly crafted in cooperation with industries in order to understand what information is useful and for how long it is useful.

That can only be decided on a case by case basis, which is why the requirement for stating the reason of the aggregation exists.

&gt; There is data I want a company to hold in perpetuity. All my games should hold all of my login information for as long as my account exists for example.

&gt; I can't tell if the law was rushed or if they wanted to right crappy vague laws on purpose or if it's just a failure to write out in laymans terms what changes need to be made to be in compliance.

The higher earner is often the man, but I’ve definitely seen cases where the woman paid alimony to the man. 

Thus statistically a bad decision for men since they are disproportionately the higher earner. 

 &gt; Statistically the primary caregiver will retain more physical custody (despite 50/50 legal custody.) The primary caregiver receives child support. The primary caregiver is usually the woman, because she’s often the one who ends up leaving work or cutting back work hours to tend to the child(ren.) But if the father is the primary custodian, then the mother pays child support to him. 

Thus statistically a bad deal for men. In addition, men trade several things in exchange to cover for the lost income(time with their family,more hours, take a job they wouldn't want etc) for the income so it would still remain unfair to not get equal custody. 

&gt; If you’re afraid of statistics, then marry someone who makes equal or more money than you, don’t have kids or be the stay at home parent. 

That's not how it works is it? You'd want to be with someone you love rather than their income. Don't have kids is a sound advice for that of course, being the stay at home parent won't be an option for most men. 

&gt; If you’re just not into marriage, then don’t get married

I was going to say that similar devices from Apple could just be less hardened, or maybe have an induction charging circuit that caused an issue, but it sounds like there's a range of devices involved.

The next thing would be software. If Apple has a safety shutoff based on surge detection or something like that it would potentially cause a problem before other devices notice. This would make sense to me because realistically I've worked around magnets bigger than MRI's and it's never been a thing we've worried about. Devices aren't as susceptible to that as people tend to think. It would also fit with Apple's brand, which is high security and high reliability by locking down anything suspicious.

If someone else doesn't know what the deal is, this seems like a good opportunity for an experiment. Get some rad techs on it.

Correct, taking this into account makes it much more likely that all of these Houses remained in power for so long.

Here's one example in actual history where things happened differently. King Philip III of France (House Capet)'s second surviving son, Charles, became Count of Valois and formed the House of Valois. His own son, the future Philip VI, would become King of France in 1328 due to the succession crisis that caused the Hundred Years Wars.

When Philip VI took the throne, the House of Valois became the royal house, but Philip VI was simply Philip III's grandson through his son Charles. Had that happened in ASOIAF, the royal House would have remained House Capet.

They gave me a steroid shot and said it was likely she wouldnt make it to full term, so they wanted to boost her lung growth. They admitted me over night to keep an eye on us because i was freaking out. I told them there was something wrong and the nurse said i was just a first time mom and didnt know what i was talking about. They did a stress test and she didnt respond. The nurse still said nothing was wrong. Her heart rate went under 120 a few times, still nothing wrong. My doctor was told over the phone that everything was fine. Well, around midnight he went to the hospital for another birth and came in to check on me while they were doing another ultrasound. He immediately started freaking the fuck out. He demanded they prep me for an emergency c-section because the baby needed to get out right away. She died moments before they got her out. Turns out she was showing all the signs of being a stillborn and had the nurses really paid attention her chances of survival would have been far greater if they did the surgery when i was admitted 10 hours earlier.

Sony will also be less inclined to share their properties with Marvel since that can cause brand confusion with the same character being portrayed in two different continuities on screen.

"They're not all equal just because they're nonstandard usage. As far as your language acquisition centers care, hearing any word used in context very often at all, provided it has utility, is effective communication.

 We survived being preverbal, and we lived through nonstandard language, and even today people are born in communities where ""correct"" means utilizing a smattering of constructions from various languages. It is unfortunate that the relatively recent notion of prescriptive language has facilitated this sort of idol worship. The prescription was derived from the averages of a populace that was not uniformly educated.

"One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.

Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess.

It modifies core game code; therefore, it is a mod. Simple as that.

Other client-side mods are absolutely not ""stuck back there""; PvP mods like 5zig and Better PvP are released with support for both older and newer Mojang versions. LabyMod is released only for older Mojang versions (1.7 and 1.8), and isn't being released for newer Mojang versions -- not because they are ""stuck back there,"" but because nobody's PvPing on the newer versions because they find the newer ones to be a lot better. On top of that, many players make custom client-side mods for specific PvP gamemodes that they maintain themselves.

There are few patches to old Mojang versions of Spigot and Paper because those releases have seen years' worth of patches. It's entirely believable that there simply aren't many bugs left to fix, and certainly no big ones.

Hypixel and Mineplex are not moving away from 1.8, and Badlion isn't moving away from 1.7. Those devs have embraced those platforms and are continuing to support them.

Development moves forward, yes, but what does ""forward"" mean exactly? Developers are continuing to build new experiences on top of a stable platform with features that players have come to expect, rather than garbage like parrots and llamas. In my view, the development on PvP servers has moved the Minecraft community forward. Just because said development isn't happening on the newest Mojang version doesn't make it backwards development.

""Development moves forward"" means that development should add features that make the game more interesting and enjoyable to individual players. If parrots are interesting and enjoyable to you, great; Mojang is moving development forward for you. But for players like me and for players like PvPers, Mojang is idle, and third parties are what really keep development moving forward.

For reference here is a [recovering Heroin addicts AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/5mub0f/spontaneoush_7_years_later_update_for_anyone_who/), he posted about randomly deciding to do Heroin one day then became addicted. Currently cannabis is the only one I would be for making legal since it is the least harmful.

We shouldn't punish someone for getting help to not become addicted anymore. They should be encouraged to seek help without fear of prosecution or questions about where they got the drugs."	unitedkingdom	unitedkingdom	-1

For the first twelve years of his life (born 170 AC) he was just Daemon Waters, son of Princess Daena and while Aegon was rumoured to be the father he would have shared the same rank as Jon and Jeyne Waters, Elaena’s bastards with Alyn Velaryon.

Aemon died 178-183 so would have known Daemon for a short while as Blackfyre or as nothing more as a skilful bastard page under the guidance of Quentyn Ball. 

Daemon, on the other hand, may very well have idolised the memory of his uncle, but I suspect Aemon Blackfyre’s name had more than sentiment to it: like the name Aegon conjured up the image of the Conqueror, the name Aemon would remind the lords of Westeros of the greatest knight in living memory."

"You literally just made an argument that steam isn't a DRM system because .02% of their games don't employ DRM, which doesn't even include valve's own products.

Yet you're accusing me of omitting and skewing information - I'd like to know exactly what I've omitted or skewed in this discussion.  It's fine that they give that option to developers, but that really doesn't have anything to do with the point that I'm making. I said that steam is the biggest DRM system on the market, and it is. 

Systems like steam exist and have existed under different companies for many years. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, GOG, Ubisoft, EA, etc. You don't have to imagine what steam would have looked like under EA or Ubisoft, because they already exist and most other systems that I've used were just as good, if not better than steam, which takes up like 2 gigs of hard drive space and requires 50 mb updates seemingly every time i open it.

I actually can't see why that comes into play in this situation, can you explain yourself better?

Third of all, I think birthdays are to celebrate the fact that the child came into this world safely.

"Ordination and priesthood are handled differently in the East than in the West. Suffice to say I've studied/lived at numerous monasteries and Zen centers in the midwest and have never seen ordained children.

Or, really any children at all. Kids don't tend to handle sitting very still and upright, staring at a wall for hours on end. One time I went to a Zen group in downtown Dubuque, Iowa and a lady brought her kids. They did somersaults on their cushions the whole time. Folks are not encouraged to bring their children to meditation sessions or retreats.

Is there a pedophilia problem going on with Buddhist priests? I haven't heard of that. I do know that some prominent Zen teachers have been accused of sleeping with (adult) students, in particular Dainin Katagiri, who was my teacher's teacher. I don't think that behavior is appropriate and should be dealt with as needed. Those relationships were consensual but Katagiri was married and so that would be a violation of the precepts.

What is the appeal of GraphQL over the OData standard? Is it simply anti-MS sentiment (and a lack of implementation frameworks in non .NET languages)?

I was communicating with the developers of one of our customers explaining our usage OData in an API we were considering exposing to them, and they suggested we consider GraphQL.

I had never heard of it, so started researching it. Not only did it deviate from REST spec (have to POST when getting data) the way you built queries and filters just seemed awkward and unintuitive compared to OData's SQL like query language using query string variables.

AC Unity ran like crap at launch but it runs OK now. With a 4 core i5 and GTX 970, it runs at 1080p 60FPS high settings without a problem, and I'm pretty sure that at ultra settings it uses 3-4GB VRAM. I personally played through the game on a i5-6500 and GTX 1070 at ultra settings.

I played through AC Syndicate when I had a HD 7970 3GB and I ran out of VRAM with some of the more demanding settings - it needed like 3300MB or something, which would also explain why you ran it fine on a 970.

You ran Rise of the Tomb Raider on a 970 with 3.5GB VRAM which has barely enough VRAM for very high texture quality. Take a look at the timestamp in this video - [GTX 1060 3GB runs out of VRAM in the in-game benchmark and has a lot of stuttering](https://youtu.be/y1RWItff0eQ?t=5m32s). I played RotTR on my 7970 3GB and had to run the game at high texture quality instead of very high.

I myself had no problems with running Ghost Recon Wildlands with a 1070, but the game VRAM usage meter was at around 3.3-3.5 GB so I took it for its word. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I can't find any reliable VRAM usage numbers for Deus Ex Mankind Divided; the only one I found was [this one](https://www.guru3d.com/articles-pages/deus-ex-mankind-divided-pc-graphics-performance-benchmark-review,11.html) but it's using a Titan X so the game would've used as much VRAM as possible. I'll retract this game.

DOOM does run wonderfully but there's a nightmare setting that requires 5GB VRAM to enable, which is what I was referring to.

Also I'm not really moving goalposts at all; I originally said that

&gt; All of these games are obviously playable with GPUs that have 3GB VRAM, but they'll have stuttering if you max out settings like texture quality while playing at 1080p.

My entire point is that there's a lot of graphical features in modern games that'll drive VRAM usage through the roof, and I gave a couple of examples."	Games	Games	-1

How *can* you disprove something that was never proved? And no, I don’t think we would end up at the same place. I wouldn’t have anything to prove since I’m not making any claim? The religious person would begin trying to prove god’s existence through normal religious examples (miracles, complexity of life, etc.)

The burden of proof isn’t a cop out, it’s a method that’s used to determine if the claims a party has made can be backed up or proved. If people are going to make claims, then they need to be backed up and the burden of backing it up lies on the person making the claim. 

The issue, is that religion is so tied into our lives, that people are literally born with the belief that religion and gods are already accepted as “proven”.

"	"**Electroconvulsive therapy**

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), formerly known as electroshock therapy, and often referred to as shock treatment, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from mental disorders. The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 and is the only currently used form of shock therapy in psychiatry. ECT is often used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, and catatonia. ECT machines have been placed in the Class II category (special controls) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1976.

During a random check the policeman will not see the error so you technically just cheated a police officer which is obviously a crime.	I commute that way on I-80 frequently and that barn always astounds me. The Trump administration are the last group of people that are gonna support a small time farm operation like that.

3287	... so then there's no point to the switch at all. Make it then you're done! $80 for cardboard, built it then no more touchy	"I think it had some incredibly good base systems. The physics based tools worked well, and they really nailed the sense of adventure by reading their players really well and rewarding ""I wonder if I can..."" kind of mentalities. Cooking was fun, trading was fun, weapons were visually cool, world interactions with your tools was fun, and it just overall had a really solid base.

Unfortunately they were missing any interesting dungeons, the weapon degradation mechanic was not well implemented, the overworld was visually bland in my opinion, and the enemy variety was sorely lacking. The plot was pretty much non-existent and what was there was kinda nonsensical. Combat was serviceable but ultimately didn't maintain interest through the length of the game. The way they designed the last boss fight was weird and unfun, almost punishing you with a weaker boss for doing well. Also the ""boss fights"" were underdesigned slugfests that didn't feel like Zelda bosses at all. With no dungeons, no interesting bosses, a very very small roster of enemies, and no mechanical tool discovery throughout the game..... it really missed the mark as a Zelda game. 

If I had my way, I'd have them cut the map-size down in half, layer it more like LttP was where everything is more tightly wound together and visually distinct, rework the weapon durability systems, cut the orb of power and korok seed puzzles down by at least half and funnel that manpower into making real Zelda style dungeons complete with tool unlocks. The story could be improved as well, though honestly that's not super high on the priority list. I'd be more comfortable with them going the Dark Souls route of doing most of the storybuilding through environments, NPC lore drops, and other forms of passive storytelling with the ""save the princess"" remaining the main thrust.

&gt; As a final question, what word/words on subs are leading to ""a certain""? I suspect it will bug me less if I hear it, and know it's coming.

Arui-wa, to aru (Notice Index 3's title), maybe occasionally Hitosu no (which is more of a ""a single [something]"") if it flows better in english.

This all depends on how the translator wants to translate it, of course. Arui-wa would work more as ""once there was a"" but it can be rearranged if the situation calls for it.

1) some kind of tax/insurance/immigration fraud to benefit one party
2) both sides want some companionship. They’ve decided they’re never going to find someone they love but are really good friends and want some legal certainty of each other’s futures and commitment to each other.
