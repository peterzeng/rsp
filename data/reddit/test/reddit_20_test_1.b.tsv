1	"By saying we're not talking about a material presence I meant we're not talking about just that. The point of the incarnation was to show solidarity with humanity, show us how to live, and to found a church so that his teachings could be retained and developed, and to atone.

An avatar just seems to be like a material presence. In the old testament God does that. But the christian incarnation is categorically distinct from those types of appearances.

Jesus is God as human to show solidarity with humanity (by suffering), to show us how to live a human life, to make sure the information is passed down, and to atone. That's the bizarre premise that is totally alien to any other religions. God suffering as the hero? God literally feeling pain? God literally feeling the urges of temptation that we feel? These are extremely unusual now and for the time.

Hindu polytheism is less probable than Christianity solely on the basis of ockham's razor. But for some mystical Hindu monotheism I would contend they are either incoherent or basically empty of any content in what they say about God. 

Hindu monotheism has the same problem that some Christian thinkers have that call themselves ""theistic impersonalists"" or ""traditional classical theists."" They make God either incoherent or devoid of content because everything about God is turned into an analogy and God is said to be 1 but 3 which is uncontroversially agreed to be at least prima facie absurd but then of course like Hindus they appeal to analogy to hide the fact they are speaking nonsense.

Anyway, I could go off on the problems with Hindu theology all night. I could also go into why I think Hagel's God suffers from similar problems.

The main point is that these avatar manifestations are nothing at all like the bizarre event of Jesus Christ."	I'm not making an ontological claim about the existence of objective moral reasons. I'm merely reporting obvious conceptual entailments. If it turns out there is no objective moral facts then moral reasons entail normative demands that aren't really there and error theory is true. The ontological reality makes no difference to the facts about what the concept of a moral reason is about or entails.	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Jorah is provided the best plan of action to get Dany on the Iron Throne as soon as possible.  Bad stuff has happened, is happening and will happen and Jorah is trying to keep that to a minimum. then Dany tries to stop one of the rapes and the other dothraki tell her no, but jorah makes the rhaegar comparison (further confirming rhaegar isnt what robert described because jorah is always right) and obeys her. jorah even goes as far as to tell dany she cant save them all.  she doesnt agree but 5 books later.... jorah was still right.

6	I always taste them straight up, no bread, off a spoon. The butter should be about 60 degrees --not too cold or warm.

7	IMO, interop should only ever go in one direction: towards the host language. Writing all new code in Kotlin and wrapping Java is fine, but a call graph that goes Kotlin -&gt; Java -&gt; Kotlin -&gt; Java, etc., is too many context switches.	Clojure is a counter-example to this. It emphasizes pure functional programming, but because of it's tight integration with the host language (Java), it has tons of easy escape hatches if you need mutability. Indeed, if you *reallllly* need mutability / performance, it's trivial just to write some Java and call it from Clojure. I think this presents a really good alternative to adding functional features to imperative languages.	programming	programming	1

The most common ingredients in chemical sunscreens include oxybenzone, avobenzone, meradimate, and ecamsule (which block UVA) and padimate O, PABA, octinoxate, octisalate, octocrylene, and cinnamates (which block UVB).    

Additionally, many sunscreen brands will put on the bottle whether or not it's a physical sunscreen or a chemical sunscreen. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends at least SPF 30."	"I hear your point. We have the same problem here in the United States, where [nearly 40% of adults are Vitamin D deficient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21310306).    

&amp;nbsp;

However, it's important to remember that geographical variations alter the amount of UV that one is exposed to when outdoors. For example, [in this pretty cool study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20363523), they compared endogenous Vitamin D synthesis in sunny Miami, FL versus chilly Boston, MA. They found that year-round in Miami, all that someone with type III skin (meaning they sometimes burn in the sun, but usually uniformly tan) needed to synthesize 400 IU of Vitamin D was 3-6 minutes in the sun at noon. Three minutes! We spend less time than that exposed to sun while driving in cars, walking around, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

It's clear that despite this exposure, people are still deficient in Vitamin D. The simple and safest solution to the above is to protect yourself from the sun and supplement Vitamin D in the diet. That way, our skin is protected from UV radiation and Vitamin D is safely provided."	askscience	askscience	1

32	"I get what you’re saying, I think an answer you would have liked to hear from me was this:

“My evidence for why I think religion exists and why humans created and are hardwired to be religious, is based on books I’ve read, scientific research and my own personal experiences.”

I’m an atheist because I don’t see any evidence to support that there is a god. And if there is ever proof, I’ll either believe it or carry the burden myself.

As for it being irresponsible, I’m not saying I know 100% that there is no god. I’m saying that based on current knowledge and provided evidence, I see no proof of a god existing. This then starts getting into the philosophy 101 class discussions of “you can’t say all crows are black because you can’t 100% prove that a crow 50 years from now won’t be born white”. 

We also might be slightly differing on our views of what an agnostic is. To me agnostic just means “on the fence” or won’t make a decision because they don’t have enough evidence”. 

I think the issue is that atheists are born religious (I was), and we end up spending our whole life having to defend ourselves for why we are atheist. It’s a weird process, and I certainly felt the same way about atheism as you at first. I was agnostic for a few years in highschool, and i started to read a lot less Richard Dawkins, and a lot more biology/neuroscience related books. This is where I started to feel myself leaning towards atheism. It was hard, and I don’t like telling my friends and family that I’m atheist. My mother is very religious, and my father is a chemist, so I was exposed to both sides. My dad is agnostic, and we’ve discussed this before. I want to be agnostic, I really do. But at a certain point I felt that I was lying to myself while I sat on the fence. I feel that science and our evolutionary path can explain why people want to believe in a god.

They still haven't seen any episodes from Season 3, but I said to him:

""Hey, you know what you should do? You should watch all the episodes with them until the one where Armin supposedly ""dies"", and then have them wait until the rest of the season is out before they see the rest  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ...""

""... niiiice  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ""

So yeah, hopefully he does that. I mean, it will be a much better way to enjoy the cliffhanger, I think."	"&gt; Your first point doesn't disprove Eren being the father


Of course it doesn't disprove anything with 100% certainty, but I think my point still stands. What I was trying to get across was that Eren being the father doesn't make sense (again, to me) because:


- he was against the idea of ""breeding like cattle"" right from the get go;


- even IF things have changed and even IF Eren was the one who actually went back on his word and came to Historia telling her to get pregnant, he still doesn't need to be the father in that scenario, nor would it make any sense for him to be, for the many reasons I pointed out, but the main ones being that any man would be suitable for the job and that by Eren actually providing the ""seed"", he could be dooming his future generations to come to said cattle life, something he wouldn't do *especially* while knowing that they have literally nothing else to think of.


&gt; your smiles and general tone of writing as I interpret it come across as condescending and overall dismissive of opposing views.


Two of his 3 points started out like this:


- Your first point is entirely pointless


- Did you even read the chapter properly?


You can argue that there was nothing wrong with the first one, but the second one is simply a childish, useless comment that serves no purpose whatsoever. To me, it's as if the user was clearly baiting and/or being a dick for no reason.


My smiles were not to be seen as you described, instead it was just me going ""well, you're seemingly upset, being obnoxious and insulting for no reason, but I won't stoop to your level, I'm fine with what you have to say but won't engage with similar behavior :)"" and that's it, trying to keep a positive vibe, is all, but I see your point that it could be perceived differently, it's just that said user decided to start things off in a rather asshole-ish manner while literally everywhere and everyone else in the thread is acting like a normal human being.


So yeah, I wasn't dismissing anything. As for his 3rd point, he just summarized a portion of the chapter *as if* I hadn't grasped it somehow, which I fail to see where/how I gave that impression.


He said:


&gt;Some MP fodder mentioned suspicious timing of Historia’s pregnancy.


Yes, he did. How does any of that imply that Eren is the father?

&gt; They can’t feed Siege to her if she’s still pregnant because it would kill the baby.

Yes, he did. How does any of that imply that Eren is the father? x2



&gt; The pregnancy was someone’s plan (Eren’s) to prevent her from inheriting Beast titan for quite a while and give Eren some time to create or execute the plan that would save her, as I said earlier.


And for the 3rd time, it being Eren's plan and Eren being the one to have come to Historia has 0 correlation to this meaning that he has to be the father, which is why I probably appeared to be dismissive of this point of his when he pretty much treated me as if I hadn't actually read the chapter."

48	"I feel like you are underestimating the meaning of all-knowing and all-powerful. If God intends for something to happen, *it happens.* If he does not intend for it to happen, *it doesn't happen.* God had absolute knowledge of everything that would happen after he created the universe, and absolute control over the creation and events that followed. Absolutely nothing is outside of his control, or exempt from his intent. Anything and everything that has or will happen only happens because he intended it to and made it so, and vice versa.

I do not know where your beliefs came from, but I know you probably did not come out of the womb with them, and thus they are not innate. In fact, it does not matter where you learned them or who taught them to you. What I am specifically asking for, is why you still hold those beliefs. Why you find it more likely that your beliefs are true rather than false. What line of reasoning or evidence convinced you?"	"Nothing happens without the Christian god's intent (assuming he exists). He is (supposedly) all-knowing, all-powerful, and ultimately good.

If something happened without his intent, he either did not know it would happen (and thus is not all-knowing), or he could not prevent it (and thus is not all-powerful). Or he is both all-knowing and all-powerful, but actually allowed/intended for a negative event to happen, in which case he is not ultimately good. If any of those cases is true, then he is not a god worth seeking as far as I'm concerned.

Your beliefs are not innate. You were not born with beliefs on the nature of souls, mysticism, and Christianity. They were learned, and there is one or more reasons why you have not discarded those beliefs. I am asking what those reasons are."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Their parents took a chance on a kid straight out of school, paid him a living wage, mentored him, and put him on a management track.  In return, they created unpaid internships and balked when we expected to be paid a living wage. 

Even at minimum wage, two weeks wages were enough for them to afford their monthly rent and have money left over for food and gas. In return, they've raised the rent to an astronomical figure in any decent area. At minimum wage, to afford a one-bedroom in a questionable area would cost more than four weeks wages at full-time.  

They had parents who broke their backs to ensure that their children would have a better life.

As the good pirate said, the exclusion principle prevents it. “Why” is hard to answer because the concept is so intuitive: I can put two things in the same place. It’s so natural and it’s really, if you think about it, at the very core of how reality works. 

Now, strictly speaking, the principle applies to fermions only, and what they can’t share is quantum state. So things like photons can be arbitrarily crammed together, but not electrons/protons/neutrons (read: anything you think of as “stuff”).

89	"&gt;  Hard problems 

Hah, those are a myth, the vast majority programs are user face line of business or similar apps, not ""hard"" problems, and in that scope it is a knowledge of business rules and consideration of vague difficulties and exceptions that matters.

Almost nobody works on hard problems, unless you are among the best of the best writing linux or a web server or some other very advanced very ""low level"" system.  Hard problems are great fun, but the vast majority of hard problems have already been solved for you, and the majority of problems out there are plumbing."	"&gt;these problems are trivial and don't need to be solved by humans. 

Welcome to the world of fourth generation and fifth generation programming languages.  ""All this stuff is easy, we can automate it away in a flash, here's a language that does as you describe instead of doing what you tell it to do"".

Every last one of them crashed and burned.

CRUD is damned easy.  Show a table, add a few buttons, no trouble.

CRUD in a business is not CRUD, it's business rules.  Yeah, you let me update an employee, but before you do that you need to know:

What other tables to change.

What updates are okay to made.

Who can make what updates.

How updates that the user tries to enter translates to data stored in a database.

What other actions might need taken in the background on user update, like recording the change, sending out messages, or otherwise.

and so on and so forth.

The trouble is that knowing *all* of these business rules, and making an app that not only does CRUD, but is open to also dealing with these business rules becomes very hard very fast to automate away with a wave of a magic wand.

CRUD is easy, but CRUD applications are often very very difficult.

The best solution, wouldn't you guess, that we have today, is to have a low-end programmer with the tools they need to do the updates quickly and easily, and to ensure this low-end programmer knows the business rules.  The person is cheap, they aren't a high end programmer, and they can get work done easy.

Which is exactly what businesses have settled on.

&gt;Unfortunately, you are the same kind of idiot, who can only hand-code REST API, and you know zilch about hard problems.

Who I am doesn't matter for this conversation, and you are making leaps and guesses here you should not be making of other people.  It is hostile, rude, and unacceptable to speak to others like this.

&gt;One of the biggest problems of today's software is unnecessary complexity.

I suppose it should be as easy, at the end of the day, to have code that looks like this: 

LOAD OPERATING SYSTEM

LOAD DRIVERS

LOAD USER INTERFACE

SHOW USER CLICKED PROGRAM

Very simple.  The rest can be automated.

Sounds easy, but if it is so easy, there is a billion dollar industry ripe for disruption, and you can change the world.  The trouble is that problems that have sat unsolved for years, despite many large scale attempts (look into fourth and fifth generation languages), are generally unsolved for very good reason.  

The only reasonable solution to writing ""simple"" code that has no complexities I can see is to have an AI sitting in the background that figures it all out for you.  Trouble is, AI aren't quite that smart yet."	programming	programming	1

We now know that Erik Prince was sent to the Seychelles by his business development consultant at Academi. Do you know what ""business development"" is? It's sales. Do you think he was introduced to this guy because he tells great jokes? Or because he had a business proposition? We don't know for sure, but as detailed as Prince was throughout that discussion, he sure was vague about ""just having a drink"" with a guy from a hostile foreign power. He could have said a lot of things, like ""He had some ridiculous proposal that I would have never agreed to and I walked away from it.""

101	"I can't speak to the specifics of your example.

I will note that a common criticism of rent control is that it provides less incentive for a landlord to maintain a property. I found an anecdotal example of this when I went to Mountain View to report on its recent experience with rent control: http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-local-rent-control-battle-20180926-story.html

Martin Cortez, 50, a San Mateo County psychiatric social worker, credits rent control with helping him stay where he has lived for more than a decade: a small, two-bedroom apartment he shares with his girlfriend and 22-year-old daughter who has severe autism. He pays $2,086 a month. Before the measure passed, he had been threatened with eviction and large rent hikes.

“It felt like the floor was being taken out from under you,” Cortez said. “You couldn’t live where you live. You did all the right things. You go to college, you work in the community, and then you couldn’t afford the crummiest of places anymore.”

Still, Cortez said he has noticed some changes since rent control has gone into effect. His previous landlord sold the complex, and Cortez said the new owners don’t maintain it. A plugged sink took weeks to fix, trash piles up and the complex’s washing machine jumps when used, he said. He’s also seen lots of new faces around neighboring apartments, which he believes are Airbnb renters, given the advertisements he’s seen on the site."	"Let's start by making clear what Prop. 10 would do. Currently, California has a state law called the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act that prohibits cities and counties from doing three major things with respect to rent control. Local governments are not allowed to:

* Implement rent control on single-family homes.
* Take away the right of landlords to charge what they want for apartments after a rent-controlled tenant moves out.
* Control rents on buildings constructed after 1995. The law also locked into place rules in cities with rent control when Costa-Hawkins passed like 1978 in Los Angeles. 

Prop. 10 simply repeals that law, allowing cities and counties to do what they want on rent control.

So to your point, yes it's possible that cities and counties — and organizations trying to add rent control via initiative — would try to extend rent control to single-family homes and/or to new apartment construction. However, proponents of the measure say there's no modern rent control regime that includes new construction and little interest in extending rent control to single-family homes owned by individuals rather than institutional investors.

In short, yes if Prop. 10 passes, cities and counties could do what you're saying. But supporters say it's unlikely to happen. -Liam"	IAmA	IAmA	1

These people need to be socially condemned to the highest degree. Humans are fallible, and react with emotion more than reason. I try to encourage anyone who is trying to impress the gravity of the impact that sexual assault has on someone's life to also champion the condemnation of false accusers. 

Rapists wouldn't get away with anything if we could stop dividing ourselves between people who care about victims and people who condemn false accusations. We are on the same side.

My heart breaks for every person that is assaulted, and I want justice for them.

Unfortunately, bringing up fake accusations usually places me in the 'other' group (in this case the group of deniers) even though that categorization couldn't be further from the truth. It is easier to dismiss someone's opinion if you feel they are not on your side.

I just wanted you to know I am vehemently on your side. I recognize the scope and severity of the issue, since I've been talking about this with my friends long before this burst into the news.

I think there is a false line that needs to be broken down. Almost everyone (aside from sadists and the perpetrators themselves) is on the side of condemning perpetrators and supporting victims. 

The false line is caused by fear. Men know that their own lives can be ruined at the drop of a hat from a single accusation, whether misconstrued, or outright false. 

As quoted in your post, ""And the deniers aren't willing to hear that. They're more afraid that what they do MIGHT be perceived as rape. Or attempted rape. And they fear for their own freedoms, rather than care about the loss of freedoms in the victims.""

This is my exact point. Their very real fears are dismissed out of hand. To imply that someone's fear for their freedoms (freedom meaning not being in jail, not being completely ostracised by everyone around you, to not be able to feed and shelter yourself and your family because your whole career and livelihood is destroyed) is trivial, honestly shows a lack of empathy. This is not a trivial fear. This fear is a fear of survival. Our survival instinct is one of our oldest instincts, dating back to the Cambrian era, several hundred million years ago.

They don't fear for their own freedoms *rather than* care about the loss of freedoms of the victims. These are *not* mutually exclusive, and to treat them as such separates you from a vast group of people ready and willing to help you.

My guess is that this denial would dissipate if you really recognized this deep-seated fear in them, rather than dismissing it without consideration."	AskWomen	AskWomen	1

126	I am just an observer, but investing in an unregulated market with no inherent value just seems like shooting blind, even without the great analogy you just posted 	Because those start ups usually have an executive summary and a plan to market. They have also gone through many other investors and not just the first one that comes out. If all the information that is expected to be presented to investors is presented its called an evaluation/assessment A start up asking for funding in a diluted market or a volatile one its a gamble. Investing in a cannabis company is a gamble. Investing in a specific niche in the cannabis industry is less of a gamble but still a gamble even though returns COULD be massive.   	business	business	1
127	"So, the investors I speak with are looking to do one of two things -- buy to flip, or buy to rent. According to the California Association of REALTORS (who did a survey on investment activity in 2017), investment activity is up. But, it still lags far behind normal residential activities.

Honestly though, the real problem investors are facing right now is that it's *hard* to buy a house. There are multiple offers on most really nice houses (that would be suitable to rent out), and multiple offers on the really low end/beat up houses that could be fixed and flipped. Add to that FHA appraisals being tight lately, and investors most investors aren't doing a huge amount of business.

BTW, you can see the CAR report here: https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Industry-360/PDF/Market-Data/Surveys/2017-Investor-Survey.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=C3006F74E3BFAC37662A901B38EF0656C6171C93

From my own experience, most people who call themselves ""investors"" are a waste of time. The really good investors will add value and look at long term gains. Then there are the ones who'll see a house that has huge potential, and want me to write an offer $80,000 below market value in an area that has a rising market. Then, get surprised when I refuse to write it.

If you're thinking of doing real estate investment, I'd be happy to put you on the right path, but, there's a lot to consider.. There's a fair amount of cash involved upfront, FHA 90-day flip rules will slow your flip down and cost you extra money, appraisers are hesitant to appraise your newly fixed up flip for $100k more just 90 days later, etc.. And, if it doesn't sell right away, you may have issues getting your price.

On the rental side, it's easier to make money -- but, you do have to worry about tenants not paying or damaging the property. No matter how good your background checks are, someone will slip through and cause you huge headaches. But, IMHO, if you can afford multiple rental properties, you can do very well."	"In California, there are two different types of licenses.

* Salesperson
* Broker

Salespersons need to work for a broker who ""holds their license"". Salespersons can not trade in real estate without a broker holding their license, and agreeing to oversee their activities. To become a broker, you need to pass three college classes, and pass a state exam.

To be a broker requires 2 years of experience and/or a 4-year degree, 8 college classes, and passing  state exam that fails about 70% of all test takers. It's a hard license to get as with it you can handle your own escrows, hold trust accounts, and employ other salespersons.

An ""agent"" is just a colloquial term for real estate agents that include both salespersons and brokers.

All REALTORS are Real Estate Agents (Salespersons/Brokers), but not all Real Estate Agents are REALTORS. To become a REALTOR, you must be licensed by your state, then you need to voluntarily join your local, state and federal board of REALTORS, and agree to follow the code of ethics. To be a REALTOR requires you to agree to run your business with rules that are far and wide more restrictive than what the state law would require.

Basically, you want to deal with a REALTOR. And, in California, you probably want to deal with a broker. AND, if you can find one, someone with the CRS designation would be a slam dunk :)

e-PRO is a certification offered by the National Association of REALTORS. It's a technology cert -- so, you take a class and have to pass an exam about using technology in real estate."	IAmA	IAmA	1
128	"How do you explain to a child that; in the formation of the state where they live, White settlers walked in, claimed the land for their own uses, killed the population that lived there if there were any objections, decided that the land we took wasn't enough, forced the remaining population to be relocated to another place hundreds of miles away, having no concern for how many die while walking there. Only for these people to again be moved to the absolutely worse part of that territory once precious materials or decent land was found there to be claimed. And then we exposed them to horrible diseases, forced them at gunpoint to integrate, introduced them to drugs and alcohol, and greatly limited their ability to earn a life for themselves outside of the reservation. And we are still pretty much doing this. But yep, we sure do love freedom, equality. 

From what I remember of school, most of what was taught about Native Americans was done in the past tense, like a thing which no longer exists or is worth learning about. "	"It probably varies by district and generation. All I know is that pretty much the only history I learned which wasn't quite as sugar coated was probably from film (Dances with Wolves, and various westerns (not saying that this wasn't dramatized or had facts skewed, only that it mentioned parts of history which were not known to me previously)) long before the school system even mentioned these parts of American History. Maybe the earliest part where there was even mention of some of the genocide being conducted as part of Manifest Destiny was in my later years of highschool, where it was still fairly minimal. I still have a social studies text book from the 5th grade sitting around somewhere, so can even go back and see if memory holds up to evidence (if I can find the darn thing). Unfortunately McGraw-Hill doesn't seem to have an online archive of old textbooks available.

The main problem, really, is that the curriculum is just so tight, with most of American History being focused on the Colonial times and Civil War just because the school is trying to prime children as much as possible for a mandatory citizenship test in 7th grade. Before highschool, the Korean and Vietnam war got essentially no discussion or even mention, and can only imagine that primary school students are getting almost nothing about any of the Gulf wars either. So it's not just that they are intentionally glossing over what is not a good part of the American Narrative, but rather time is too short for proper discussion. "	IAmA	IAmA	1

"&gt; everyone says that... and then they write ""2 years of React experience is necessary, submit CV with projects"" in the advert

Yeah... I can't help the other teams and companies that do this, but in every single job posting I've been a part of I explicitly throw these things out in favor of ""Experience with React, Angular, Ember or similar frameworks is recommended"" or similar.

In all reality, every framework has its own little quirks and differences and paradigms, but it all boils down to building a web app. If you can do that, the rest is just browsing docs for new things.

The only time I would consider a hard ""x years with y"" requirement is if I'm building a team that works **on** `y`. Like if I was at Facebook hiring for the React team. But I'm not, so I won't.

148	"&gt;However, it is important to remember that the test for capacity to consent is whether the other person is able to appreciate the nature and quality of the act.

How is a person supposed to assess that? How can you say, with confidence, that the person you're taking to bed - who you know is intoxicated - is clear headed enough to 

&gt; appreciate the nature and quality of the act.

You mention other symptoms, but take a look at any of the ""was I raped"" threads, and at least one asshole is in there explaining how he and his girlfriend were both blackout drunk but totally into it and does that mean they raped each other? 

Sexual conduct with someone who is severely intoxicated is a risk, period. If you take that risk, you may be accused of rape. I'm not saying everyone who has sex with some stranger who is drunk is a rapist, I'm just saying there are ways to stay out of that situation. I mean really - if someone needs to be drunk in order to sleep with you, is that what you really want?

Also, if someone is ""blackout drunk"" - not producing memories of the encounter - then all they have is the word of the person they are with that they consented. They don't know if they did or not. Within the last couple of days was a story from a girl who was on her period, never has sex on her period, and woke up naked after having had sex. She doesn't remember it happening - and so can't remember if she consented or not - but does remember not having an interest in having sex with any of the people she was with. She is within her rights to accuse someone of raping her - that's the risk they took by taking a drunk stranger to bed. 
"	"I also want to point out that bartenders in a lot of places are legally required to refuse service to patrons who are drunk - not just those who aren't aware they're ordering a drink. 

I'm making the point that if someone is choosing to have sex with someone they know is intoxicated, without being sure of their interest, boundaries etc. they run the risk of being accused of rape. If they follow your advice, they can still be accused of rape. If they think they're safe based on your post, they are wrong. They have a much higher chance of being accused of rape (and also actually raping someone) by following your advice than they do if they make sure their partners aren't drunk and are genuinely, enthusiastically into it. 

Having sex with intoxicated people is risky behaviour. "	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	1

158	"&gt;Whether or not this case meets (or should meet) the legal bar for defamation, it's wholly appropriate and inoffensive to libertarian sensibilities to celebrate the idea of the SPLC compensating someone they erroneously named and shamed (causing harm to him)

The SPLC isn't compensating this guy out of the goodness of their heart, and the harm they caused to him was protected speech. This guy has abused the legal system by making feckless threats. The SPLC should never have been placed in a position where it had to potentially go to trial in order to protect its basic rights.

This is a libertarian nightmare: protected speech that offended someone resulted in threatened legal action that, ultimately, cost the speaker tremendous money and time. The actions of this activist are chilling to any group, whether as far left and sensitive as the SPLC or as far right as Brietbart, that wishes to label a person or group in a negative light based upon a given set of facts. "	"&gt;Like would a list of communists during the McCarthy era have been ""just an opinion"" too?

If that list was based upon fact, then yes. And the fact doesn't need to be ""That guy is a communist."" It can be, ""That guy shops at a business known for communism"" or ""That guy read a communist book"". If the opinion is based on fact, the conclusion can be entirely unfair and erroneous. 

&gt;If there isn't a civil recourse to defamation I think people might start taking less civil routes. Gawker found this out the hard way.

Gawker wasn't sued for defamation, and they got several pre-trial motions by Hogan dismissed on First Amendment grounds. They ultimately lost on invasion of privacy and their actions - specifically, the display of Hogan's genitals and his engagement in sex - were deemed to have no journalistic value (as admitted by Gawker itself, in fact).

On the other hand, the SPLC said ""This activist has done X, Y, and Z. Based on those things, we think this."" Their conclusion was dumb and unfair, but they have an unfettered right to express their opinions on any set of facts. "	Libertarian	Libertarian	1

So it's strongly recommended that you begin to take proper steps in properly securing your BTC and claiming your fork coins in a safe and secure manner.  IE your private keys are never on a device that talks to the internet.

You can look through my history I have some posts going over how to claim some various forks.   

Jimmy Song is running a bitcoin forking business helping people gain access to their funds so if you have a good amount of bitcoin and want to pay someone to do it that's an option.  

I'd help you for a small fee but again you should really be more careful with your BTC than trusting randoms on the internet.

Sure you can go to coinmarketcap and pull up over 1000 of them, but the majority of them are really more like stock than an actual currency. 

Look at SALT for example.  It looks like a great project, but i'm not really sure why SALT has a blockchain ... it seems kind of like a way of doing crowd funding and you have to buy salt to have a membership... which is cool.  I'm not sure if smart contracts are stored in salt or not that would be kind of cool.  

Then take something like Ripple for example.  Again .. not a crypto currency. Digital sure... but it's centralized and controlled by a business.  

When you look at the principles underlying Bitcoin and what makes it so attractive to use as a currency/store of value.  It's the decentralization.  Without decentralization it's not viable for long term use.

You wouldn't follow the Terran's split army to make sure all your banelings connect well... It would be a lot more effective to pre-split your army and set up a concave instead. You run your lings past T's army, then a-click to get a surround, preventing T from splitting any further so that you can land those baneling hits. As for tanks, just set up a flank with lings from behind, which, again, takes just one a-click. If you don't have a good flank &amp; no vipers, it's probably a fight you shouldn't take.

That's what I mean - Z may have to pre-split, set up a flank, and force engagements at its most favorable moments. But he doesn't control his army like a T.

You seem to be acting like ""Islam"" means ""The Truth"" and me calling Salafism Islam means I'm sayying Salafism is truth.

Islam is a name for a religion, within which there are multiple variants of belief, just as there are more than one denomination in christianity, more than one school of thought in Judaism and Buddhism.

Every religion has these different schools, and in every religion, at most one of these many variants of belief can be right.

Do you think that both Sunnis and Shias are Islam? Because if Islam is right, well one of these variants must be believing in something wrong.

Why is it so hard to wrap your head around the idea that Salafis could be Muslims, but very very wrong Muslims who aren't doing what Allah wants?

Do you think Catholics think Protestants do everything right?
No. Once upon a time they killed each other over their heresy...
But they are still both regarded as being Christians.

*Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.*

 - **Romans 13:1-7**

*But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.*

1. A personal story that actually guided you through the maps, seamlessly leading you to ever-higher areas. The butchery to the current system gutted the relevance of rewards (By the time you finish a chapter, the rewards are 5 levels out of date), and, instead of providing guidance through the world, enforced backtracking. I just had two friends express interest in the game but quit because of the complete lack of guidance 1-20, because the level 10 story is just a starting zone runaround. So, fuck you, whichever asshole decided dumping chapters on players at once and gutting the game's guidance was better than players having to level up a bit more if they're blazing through the instances too fast (Or try a chapter underleveled)
2. World bosses were not on a timer, and instead provided an engaging challenge to players who sought out their initiating events on the map at the time. Now they're just AFK loot pinatas. (my friends were unlucky enough to stumble across the Frozen Maw world boss. They were NOT impressed)
3. it was actually possible to catch the kegs in Wayfarer Foothills. Difficult, but possible.
4. Bundles in starting zones! They made the starting zones SO much more memorable, and created a great first impression due to the diversity in gameplay they encouraged. Especially in the Plains of Ashford. Loading cannons/mortars, and the arena interaction."	Guildwars2	Guildwars2	1

&gt;“I’ve been cutting my wrists since fourth grade because of you and (my name).”

Even if it was true, and everything says it isn't, the reality is that of course it wouldn't be you or the friend that were the source of it. It would be the very clear mental illness she has always suffered from. 

&gt;I acted nice to her but I didn’t really like her. Is that backstabbing? 

Of course not. That's being excessively polite and feeling an onus to support her, something you are still prone to and that she has taken advantage of the entire time she has known you. Backstabbing is what she does, actively undermining your standing with peers and strangers for her own gain. 

&gt;I think they’re mad at me for leaving school, because they were constantly begging me to come back to the school I used to go to. I cannot handle that school- too many people, too many bad memories. Anxiety goes through the roof. I don’t know what to do about any of this.

Use this as a fresh start. A group that would resent you for that is a group that you are better off leaving behind. Start a new life with new friends, learn what you can from this. It's not even that outrageous: I've lost track with all my highschool and uni friends, all my friends as an adult I got as an adult. These are people that make you anxious and as someone with anxiety you have to be realistic: both about avoiding contexts and about when you are blaming yourself unreasonably.

If she is going to deal with it you need to be pretty sure she is taking real and actual steps towards that. If she isn't seeing a therapist and hasn't got a pretty darn good reason for it then can you really be confident she wants to change? Etc. 

Just be careful. Snooping is a terrible thing to do but you might convince yourself it isn't a big deal after a while. But the anxiety that the snooping is a symptom of is the real problem and will keep on being the source of issues in your relationship. Next time it will be her insisting you don't meet female friends alone, or asking you to stay home more, things that individually she might not even acknowledge are a problem like the snooping is but they are all part of the same complex.

&gt;his servers being located in Russia

WikiLeaks is hosted in numerous countries and under numerous jurisdictions, in case of events which adversely impact the organisation, its website and server(s). Your singling out of a Russian-based host is misleading and betrays fact.

&gt;the Russian agenda he's pushed

In what way? He has always been critical of the US

[If you're speaking of the election, this was WikiLeaks' broader opinion:](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/)

&gt;We believe it would be much better for GOP to win. Dems+Media+liberals would then form a block to reign in their worst qualities. With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities, dems+media+neoliberals will be mute. She’s a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath.”  
&gt;  
&gt;GOP will generate a lot of opposition, including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition. Hence Hillary has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP, and has the will to do so.

Sure, it may have aligned with Russia's opinion insofar as Russia also preferred the GOP, but that's basically as deep as it goes. WikiLeaks wanted the GOP to win because they perceived a GOP presidency as weaker than a Democratic presidency, and preferred there to be a liberal block which held power to account.

If you're speaking of things like the Panama Papers, they opposed them insofar as the entire trove was not released. [WikiLeaks actually wanted the Panama Papers to be released in full.](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/panama-papers/panama-papers-wikileaks-kristinn-hrafnsson-calls-for-data-leak-to-be-released-in-full-34601909.html)

[People point to this tweet as evidence that WikiLeaks was critical of the Panama Papers because they were attacking Putin:](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/717670056650530816)

&gt;US govt funded #PanamaPapers attack story on Putin via USAID. Some good journalists but no model for integrity.

[But not many point to this follow-up tweet which provides further context of WikiLeaks' position:](https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/717810984673484800)

&gt;Claims that #PanamaPapers themselves are a 'plot' against Russia are nonsense. However hoarding, DC organization &amp; USAID money tilt coverage.

It is clear that WikiLeaks wanted the entire trove to be published, and was concerned that the funding, team and limited scope of publication could negatively impact the reporting and coverage of the leaks.

Any correlation with Russia is likely to be incidental.

&gt;the fact he acted as an intermediary during the DNC hacks that benefited Trump and Russia.

Again, citing US government reports ([1](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download), [2](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf)), it is clear that WikiLeaks acted not dissimilar to other journalists and flagship publications like the New York Times in its information-gathering and publishing, respectively. The only way WikiLeaks was acting as an 'intermediary' was as a publisher which received information from a third party (allegedly Russia via the Guccifer 2.0 pseudonym) and released that to the public.

Still not quite ""encouraging supporters to shoot hilary"" 

Though to be fair, I thought that was a hint for armed rebellion rather than assassination (Since that's what the second amendment is for).

That said this is more a semantics discussion at this point. I usually consider it rehab up to return to sports/ADL including a plan to prevent re-injury."	"You don't have to cite an article to know kipping pullups increase the risk of shoulder impingement. That doesn't mean kipping pullups shouldn't be an exercise. Doing strict handstands and playing volleyball also increase the chance of shoulder impingements. That doesn't mean they shouldn't exist.

If your goal is getting big/strong you can replace kipping pullups with exercises that are both more effective and reduce the risk of secondairy shoulder impingement.

If your goal is performing an act that features a similar movement, training dynamic whole body flexion and extension or winning a crossfit competition it's good to practice kipping pullups.

I think the kipping pullup has a very valid place in the arsenal of human movement and there is nothing inherently bad about the movement. That said it's important to realise the high mobility, coordination and strength demands to perform the movement properly. Therefor teaching it to relatively untrained people and letting them perform for time is a bad idea.

223	I said I wasn’t mad about him not driving drunk I was upset that he didn’t tell me he was drinking and wouldn’t return my calls or texts especially when we often have lunch together.   	"So today I had to leave extra early for work because I had a big presentation and forgot my lunch.  I’m only allowed 25 minutes for lunch and my workplace is a good 10 minutes from the closest restaurant so trying to go out and grab something is difficult. I wasn’t able to go to the cafeteria because I’m allergic to what they were serving today.  

My husband had yesterday and today off.  He works 70+ hour weeks so I am the main caretaker for our children and because I am a school teacher I never get a day off without kids.  I also take care of the house.  

Today at 10 am I realized I forgot my lunch and texted asking if he could bring it to me.  He replied that he couldn’t didn’t tell me why and refused to answer any calls or text for the rest of the day.  After school I had another presentation and then I picked up the kids.  When we arrived home at 6pm he was just getting out of bed and told me he had been drinking so he couldn’t bring me lunch because he couldn’t drive.  

I’m not upset he wasn’t drunk driving but usually on his days off I ask him to join me for lunch just so we can spend time together since he works so much.  Am I an asshole for being angry that he got drunk instead of helping me today?"	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	1
224	So, are we going to blame Trump for these high gas prices or are we going to blame Obama since the left wants to give Obama the credit for the economy doing so well at the moment? I just need to know the narrative so I can correctly explain it out in public. Thank you!	Ok. By your logic, Clinton's amazing economy was a result of the policies implemented by Reagan and daddy Bush. Bush's bad economy was actually Clinton's economy. Obama's bad economy was actually Bush's economy. Trump's FANTASTIC economy is Obama's economy. I mean, let's go ahead and ignore all of the regulations that Trump has slashed, which has created incentives for businesses to thrive and prosper across the land. We can ignore this. Even with your logic, Republicans are still much better with handling the economy. Reagan = Good, H.W. Bush = Good, Clinton = Bad, W. Bush = Bad, Obama = Good, Trump = We will see when the next President is elected (I assume bad, though, since we hate Drumpf). That is fine. I will take that. 	news	news	1

That suggests that opinions you have become versed in are the most prevalent among Christians (no source given to verify), or that even if it is the most widely held belief, that suv a belief is consistent with what the Bible actually says. 

For example on that last one, it is true that a very significant number of ""religious people"" think that the only requirement to having a good spiritual life is to be moral and do good deeds. However the Bible does not support that idea at all.

But we are drifting. You are convinced that this is the only possible reality, and I think it may be impossible to convince you otherwise. But you go further to say that Christianity can't believe in an infinite, while I (a Biblical literalist) am saying the infinite must be. I do not know whether or not you are legitimately open to hearing information to the contrary of your position, but it seems that way to me. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

236	I've been seeing this claim that she wanted to go in a certain order, but I haven't see the source for that assertion. Can you link the source?	"&gt;It is unknown what effect that question might have on the results.

[The American Statistical Association](http://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-CitzenshipQuestion.pdf) wrote to Secretary Ross (who has also expressed similar concerns) that the addition of the question would negatively impact the accuracy of the census. Now, I have a degree in social science methodology, but AMSA is a completely different level of mathematical expertise. Additionally, they rely on the accuracy of public demographic information for everything. There is no doubt in my mind, or theirs, that including the question would make the census less accurate. So, to justify the addition of the question legally, you need to justify why getting less accurate data is better than not asking the citizenship question.

&gt;the problems remains, we need to know how many illegal aliens are in our country.

The American Communities Survey asks the same questions and regularly collects the same data. The difference is that there is a better time frame to collect the data so field observers can often administer the survey itself and ensure people understand the government can't use the data to hunt them down. It is highly unlikely that many illegal immigrants will answer a census document that asks them to disclose their status without being able to ask legal questions to observers or surveyors.

If your goal is to assess how many illegal immigrants there are, the ACS does that. Thus, the legal justification to make the census less accurate is absolved.

&gt;And is it fair that areas that are heavily populated by illegal aliens get more of a voice in Washington or more government funding?

It doesn't matter if its fair, it matters what the law says. The Constitution requires an ""actual Enumeration"" of ""people,"" not citizens. If you don't like that, you should propose a Constitutional Amendment. The *American* children of illegal immigrants still go to schools and need healthcare. Moreover, illegal immigrants pay federal, state, sales, and local taxes without getting access to most state or federal entitlement benefits. Most of them are paying into a system they will never benefit from. If anything, it is unfair to exclude them from the census.

&gt;IMHO illegal alien populations should not effect things like the number of delegates a state gets, for example.

I don't know what to tell you. Your social contract says they should. They may not be able to vote, but they still live in these places and pay their taxes. What you are suggesting is taxation without representation. That seems pretty un-American.

There are ways to change how the census works, doing it maliciously and illegally seems like a hard sell to me. I'm sure the fact that some Central American people want to live in the United States infuriates you, but that isn't a reason to fuck up the census. The only reason to change the census would be to make it more accurate or fill in gaps in the ACS. This does neither."	politics	politics	1
237	27 is a completely fine time to quit partying and get your shit together. Your girlfriend sounds really mean, though.

Both Half-Life games were hailed as pinnacles of achievement when they were released and earned near unrivaled amounts of 'Game of the Year' and whatever else awards. With other games emulating then for years to follow.

Sure the gaming landscape has evolved to be more multiplayer focused. But that's more down to developers realizing that they can jank together one map, some cosmetics, a deathmatch mode and call it a day, which is a hell of a lot cheaper than making a deep narrative driven game. But that doesn't mean there isn't a market for such games anymore - something like Skyrim is proof of that.

Despite Valve's various failings then definitely still have a reputation for making stellar games which would again help anything with their name on it sell, even if HL3 failed to be as revolutionary as 1 and 2 were in their day. And lastly there's the fact that they don't even need to make money off their games due to Steam revenue. In fact their business model for a while now has been to give their games away to draw more users to steam which will ultimately make them more money. So if we do ever see a HL3 then I wouldn't be surprised if it's sold for cheap."

262	"You’re kind of an asshole.

So the whole rest of your work life you’re going to have difficult coworkers and may, at some point, have to manage difficult employees.  If you let them wind you up like this, you’re going to be miserable.

All of these things, except her talking shit, have no impact on you.  So what if she stole the trainers password? That’s for her and the trainer to work out, not you.  So what if she’s on her phone during classes?  You’re not functioning in a supervisory capacity, are you?  Again, that’s between her and the trainer (and your boss).

You should focus on you and how you do your job, not on her and how she does hers, because one of those you can control and one you can’t."	"So I don’t think you’re the asshole, but I don’t think he is either.

There was a woman I loved quite a bit who shot and killed herself.  I took her for granted when she was alive.  She loved Kinoki Foot Pads, told everyone to try them, and one day I told her that they turned black any time they got wet and not because they were removing toxins.  Why would I do that... her believing in them didn’t hurt me and brought her joy, so why would I want to take that from her?

When she died, I resolved to be the man I should have been for her.  But my current wife would say I still do some of the things you’re talking about... even though I’m conscious of the fact that I took a previous girlfriend for granted and am very motivated to change.

One of the things I would ask you to think about is that we love the person that is, not the person we want them to be.  I suspect these things that are bothering you are not new things he just started doing... if that’s the case, and you’ve been happy for 12 years, what has changed?  If that’s the case, is it right to be upset or angry if you haven’t talked to him and told him in clear, plain language that you want something different from him?

I think it’s also important to recognize that two people can love each other in completely different ways but that doesn’t mean one loves the other more.  I suspect that him wanting to watch your movies with you is more important to you than him actually watching the movies, because you want to do things for him and you think he loves you less if he doesn’t want to do things for you.

Maybe you should talk about this more, during the day time.  "	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	1
263	"Hey guys, so I'm going to have about 5.5 weeks to travel around South America this year, and I'm thinking of going to Argentina and Chile. I'm not really a city person, I'm much more into hiking. Looking for some advice on a possible itinerary I was thinking about. I'm thinking, start in the Puerto Montt area, fly to southern Patagonia, then head up to Buenos Aires (maybe stopping at peninsula Valdés on the way?). I don't really know if I want to spend a ton of time in Buenos Aires, or just use it as a place from which to go to Iguazú Falls or Salta/quebrada de Humahuaca.
Some questions -


- Should I/can I base myself in Puerto Montt to see Huilo Huilo or Villarrica or Chiloe? Which of these do you recommend? At the very least it seems the best place to fly out of to get to punta arenas and see torres del paine


- Going from Patagonia up to northern Argentina, how should I travel and where should I stop? I'd really like to go whale watching in the Valdés peninsula but I'm not sure it's worth how much time and money that will cost (expensive, roundabout flights or crazy long bus rides?)


- recommendations about the area around Salta/san Pedro?


- for some of these parks is it necessary to rent a car to actually get from airports/bus stations to the parks and hiking trails?


- am I really missing out on anything awesome by not spending time in cities?

Thanks so much!

edit: please note lots of **or**'s . I am not trying to see every single national park in the country, though I would dearly like to. I am looking for what you guys recommend out of these things and which are feasible to transport myself between."	Thanks for the detailed response! I wonder, if I'm already going to be renting a car just over the other side of the border, since I'd like to see Chiloe or one of the chiliean parks near there. Would it be feasible to rent a car in Puerto Montt, say, and return it in Bariloche to catch a bus or flight from there?	travel	travel	1

265	"I haven’t been on Facebook in a few years. Even back then it appeared very unhealthy. How can you live a life when you are constantly comparing your life to others? Wisdom and maturity can help people see through the BS and recognize that behind the best vacation photos, the best family photos is fighting, angst, stress, and worry. Those are a fundamental part of being human. No one can avoid them. I doubt Fakebook’s positive influence on society. 

My niece is an intelligent and beautiful young girl. However, she has a fascination with being rich. She now has verneers when her teeth were fine to begin with and she dates men in their 40s. She is in her early twenties. She openly admits to looking for a rich Jewish guy. Meanwhile she jumps from guy to guy and they are just using her. I worry that the younger social media generations are going to have prevalent issues with their self worth and self esteem. That they will completely judge themselves by what they have or what they own. Because all they see is the best of their peers lives. 

That is a tough world to live in. Some strange world where you so easily judge and are easily judged. Where your life seems so terrible compared to the perfect life of others.

Life is not a competition, it is a journey. It is unique to each of us and happiness is not in the things we accumulate along the journey but in the experiences and relationships that we found along the way. 

Frugality in my opinion is a way to make that journey a little less stressful, a little more generous, experiences more memorable, relationships a little deeper, and most importantly more meaningful. 

What is the alternative? To be a slave to stuff and competing in a pointless competition that you simply cannot win?

266	"Drinking does not lead to rape. OT is risky behaviour - it could cause alcohol poisoning - but rape will only happen because of someone else's choices, not the person choosing to drink.  Choosing to ignore lack of consent or coerce  someone causes rape. If you don't want to be accused of rape, don't have sex with excessively drunk people. 

Also, I never mentioned men, that's your assumption, not mine. "	"A 16 year old wanting to have sex with a 22 year old isn't all that alarming or surprising - especially if that 16 year old has a history of unwise decisions.

He says he enjoys that position and I try different movements (up/down vs. forward/back), I try to keep him engaged by kissing him, touching him, and making noises, but it doesn't seem to help. He keeps insisting on this position because he thinks it'll make me cum but it's really just not working anymore.  I'm scared to bring it up because I don't want to make him feel bad about it, he already feels guilty when I don't cum. What can I do?

**Edit/update:** with the help of some liquid courage I managed to bring it up to him and he said he didn't realize that that was happening, but he says he's trying really hard *not* to cum before me and tries to focus on other things and supposedly that's the problem. Who knows."	sex	sex	1

274	I got up to 280lbs in college when I found cycling to be the best way for me to lose weight. I started at a low-moderate resistance @ 16MPH in half hour to 45min intervals. By the end I was down to 200lbs at a moderate resistance @20-22MPH for an hour at a time, 2-3 hours per day. This took 2 years due to summers off and lack of access.	"Thanks! You are right about dieting too. Keep very hydrated because when I was done with sessions my clothes would add a whopping 2-3 lbs because of all the sweat (gym was always warm which made it worse).

The biggest thing in my opinion was cutting out the garbage from my diet (pizza, Chinese food, fried buffalo wings, beer/soda, potato chips, etc.). I took my diet to the extreme at first by limiting myself to &lt;1500 calories made up of as much protein as possible and no carbs + biking. You WILL feel like absolute shit if you do that, but I was dumb and thought “less calories is more weight loss, right?” It was a big mistake I’ve learned from. 

so I’d advise cutting out as much sugar as possible, limiting carbs, incorporating a lot of greens, and having lots of smart snacks. I realized it was more expensive to eat healthy but it’s for your health. One of my favorites was venison jerky which is extremely lean, delicious, and a very easy snack.

EDIT: also, longer sessions have a compounded effect of after burn. Keeping my heart rate that high for that long while drinking loads of water (1-2 gallons a day depending on how much I worked out.

This is such a great question and such a hard place to be in - loving someone who has a difficult history. I would: 1. encourage them to get professional help to make sense of their past and figure out how to keep it from holding them back or repeating patterns; 2. love them when they repeat past patterns and make troublesome choices in relationships; 3. avoid shaming or pushing them too hard when their current behavior doesn't make sense to you; 4. be healthy with your boundaries and how much you allow yourself to get sucked in to the cycle they might be stuck in. Sometimes love requires distance to be the most helpful and healthy for both of you."	"LOL. For your friend....you are right that online counseling is not as well advertised.

[About](https://np.reddit.com//9g1g5f): 

&gt; This sub and all the research posted here really has opened my eyes regarding child trafficking. Thank you to everyone here for all the research you’ve shared. There is clear evidence that child trafficking is a worldwide industry. The most frightening part of it is that it is not a poorly-financed group of petty criminals – it a well-financed, well-organised operation. And it is used by large capital interests, primarily to entrap and blackmail people in power, including politicians, businessmen, the media, and even the police. If you’re wondering why our governments seem to continually serve large corporate interests instead of their voters, this is one of the reasons.

&gt; The material is out there and it is reliable. So much work has gone into investigating the issue and producing the material – all I’ve done is put it together into one package to tell a comprehensive narrative, so you can see it all in one place. This is what I’ve done – the film is called Imperium and I’ll release it tomorrow. The film is split into ten parts, told over two films (Volume I is 1hr57, Volume II is 2hr40). Once I release it it will be yours. It belongs to all of you and always has. I hope it sheds some light on the issue.

Why do you believe this? Sure, we have not discovered everything, but there is no evidence to support a belief that there is an unknown force. We don't know what it is that we don't know, and so it is an act of faith to believe that one of the things that we don't know is a force.

And why call it a higher power (a term generally only used when trying to hide the fact that the person is referring to a god)? The four fundamental forces of the universe are never described as a higher power. So why believe that an unknown potential force is a higher power.

310	"So, I've been seeing some guides that recommend building to 5 as consistently as you can before you spend HP (while being careful not to over cap). That's pretty antithetical to the way I played ret before (I only started during ABT) where the divine purpose ring plus T21 4 piece meant that you could burn pretty much the second you got to 3 and be just fine with regards to getting a good flow going.

When you play, do you tend to try to get all the way to 5 before you start spending, or just get up to 3? What are the benefits of one approach or the other?

Separate question. If you are sitting at 2 HP and you have 1-3 GCDs before your next builder comes up, what do you tend to do? I generally get anxious to do something, so I tend to refresh inquisition during this downtime. But I wonder if maybe I should just be patient / eat the downtime to get to my actual DPS spenders quicker.
"	"So I've discovered a weird feature of ret pally HP management. It comes from the fact that 1) wake of ashes doesnt have to hit anything to cap HP anymore, 2.) HP decays at a rate of about 1 HP per 10 sec, and 3) the cooldown of wake is 30 seconds.

What this means, is that you can essentially ensure that while you aren't in combat, you can reliably always have 3-5 HP on hand. 

This seems pretty useful for prepping before a boss fight. If you are 30 seconds out from pull, pop wake to give you 5 HP. Then on like the 5 before pull, you can have 3 HP to burn inquisition *as part of your pre-potting.* Then on pull, you are just 2 GCDs away from starting your burn phase (judge + blade + avenging). And, as an added bonus, your wake of ashes will definitely be available again within the burn phase, so you aren't really losing anything to do this.

If you time things well, I think you could do something like this:

(Pre-pot)

* **Wake** + SoV + pre-pot + inq

(Fight begins)

* judge + blade + wings + TV/DS + **Wake** + etc.

317	"I learned about PSA from my parents, who still believe it. I believed it until I became Catholic in 2009. At that point, I started looking for clear Biblical evidence of it, and I was surprised at how lacking that evidence is.


We're getting closer, though. I can agree with almost everything you said. God is just, and merely passing over sin would be contrary to his nature. That's what the OT sacrificial system was about, and that's what Christ's sacrifice is about.


Where we still differ is where you equate ""offering"" with ""guilt-bearer"" (or, more specifically, punishment-bearer). Jesus bore our sins in order to carry them away from us (just like the scapegoat), not in order to be punished in our place.


God is just, but it looks to me like PSA interprets ""just"" to mean ""unwilling to forgive"". If a sin (or a debt) is truly forgiven, there is no punishment (or payment) required from anyone. If God requires that someone be punished, he hasn't forgiven the sin. If you owe me $100 and your brother pays me the $100, it would be ridiculous for me to then tell you ""I forgive your debt. You don't have to pay."" I already got paid! There's no mercy or benevolence there.


The issue that must be resolved then, is 1) God cannot simply ignore sin, as that would be contrary to his nature, yet 2) God does forgive sin, as we learn from the Bible. The resolution is to understand Christ's sacrifice (and OT sacrifices) as a gift, not a punishment. Because humanity has offered a pleasing gift to God in reparation for sins, the sins have not been ignored; but because the sins have not been punished, there is still room for God to forgive: ""He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities.""


Someone already posted this quote from St. Thomas Aquinas, but I think it's helpful:

&gt;""I answer that, He properly atones for an offense who offers something which the offended one loves equally, or even more than he detested the offense. But by suffering out of love and obedience, Christ gave more to God than was required to compensate for the offense of the whole human race. First of all, because of the exceeding charity from which He suffered; secondly, on account of the dignity of His life which He laid down in atonement, for it was the life of one who was God and man; thirdly, on account of the extent of the Passion, and the greatness of the grief endured, as stated above (III:46:6). And therefore Christ's Passion was not only a sufficient but a superabundant atonement for the sins of the human race; according to 1 John 2:2: ""He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.""

http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4048.htm#article2"	"&gt;Where, exactly does the connection break down for you?

I guess I'd point back to the scapegoat in Lev 16. The scapegoat bore the sins of the people, but it (along with the sins) was removed, not punished. To say that Jesus removed our sins doesn't necessarily mean that Jesus suffered the punishment for our sins.

And my point about Isaiah 53 wasn't that punishment was only mentioned once, it's that it is never mentioned in a context that suggests a literal interpretation. Psalm 18:31 says that God is a rock. Must I conclude that God is made out of granite? Of course not. Show me a literal context where God is described as rock, and I'll have to accept that he's a rock. But if all you can show me is the word being used once as a poetic metaphor, then I'm not going to take it literally."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Then, it is rather difficult to predict how much the price of a card like Mana Crypt or Imperial Recruiter will drop once reprinted.

325	"&gt; You should just do those things without being a part of the Catholic Church. 

I agree, but you can also do them while part of the Church.

&gt; If the main goal of the Catholic Church was good then the Inquisition wouldn't have happened and the leader of the Church wouldn't protect and support child rapists. 

What makes it impossible for evil things to happen within an organization when its main goal is good? Take those secular charity organizations like Amnesty. They have members sexually abusing vulnerable people, adults and children, in poor countries. Still, the main goal of the organization is good.

&gt; If there are people who do good in the Church they are a minority. It's simply not possible for the Church to have gone so long harboring rapists if the majority were good people. They would have been handed over to authorities and stripped of their position.

The good people in the Church are not a minority.  We are talking about a billion people here. You can't possibly claim that the majority of those are evil people. The large majority of Catholics are regular people, trying to live a normal, good life like all of humanity. The sad fact is that the evil people within the Church are the ones trying to take the positions of power, from where they can harbor the rapists.

&gt;Yet nothing is changing. I am not sure how you are fighting this but it's obviously not working. 

The Church is 2000 years old, it's the oldest institution in the world. Its hierarchical structures are extremely hard to change, and it's those structures, and the evil people greedy to climb them, that are allowing all of the abuse to happen and to be covered up. It's not easy for simple, good Catholics at the bottom of the hierarchy to change the Church for the better, but trust me, many millions are trying their best. Some by simply doing good, others by actively protesting against the Church's structures.

&gt; The Church hasn't stood for anything good at least since 1100 AD.

There are some flaws in your post. Christians, Jews, and Muslims believe in the same god, not the same type of god. Practice is where they differ, as well as interpretation. But the Jews believe the covenant with God is Jew-specific. The Qur'an says that prophets were sent to all peoples; Muhammad was simply the last prophet in that view, and it accounts for the different religions springing from this (""to you your religion and to me my religion..."")

But this is beside the point. I have my own spiritual path and nothing in it claims to be the only way, nor does it profess to have a monopoly on some sort of truth."	"This should not have been downvoted.

The point is also reinforced by Christ's words, when he asked that this cup pass from him, but ""thy will, not mine, be done"".

331	"I know this doesn't answer your question (and I hope this doesn't detract from your post), but I think people of all stripes need to ask themselves three questions whenever they see an ""anonymous source"" cited:

1.) Did the source provide any sort of documentary evidence or proof for their claim?

2.) Are any other verifiable sources cited as making a similar claim?

3.) Is there a clear timeline of when we can expect to find out if said source's claims are true?

If the answer to all three is ""no,"" I think people need to take any claims made by said anonymous source with a grain of salt. I think all ""sides"" are guilty of this; many MSM reports about ""Russiagate"" have relied on anonymous sources whose assertions either remain unproven or have been outright disproven; yet many liberals still accept them as sacrosanct fact.

That being said, Q Anon is far less credible than even the most sloppily cited Russiagate claims. He's a guy on 4chan who writes vague riddles, occasionally makes predictions (the more specific of which never come true), and offers wild claims without any documentary evidence. I believe the wide acceptance of his claims comes from 

1.) A hunger for them to be true (confirmation bias, basically)

2.) The fact that he's *not* MSM (therefore, he *must* be credible). 

Every article and claim (be it from *The New York Times* or some yahoo on 4chan) should be critically assessed, and vigorously interrogated for corroborating evidence/sources/facts. Sometimes, a newspaper (or TV show) can provide unsourced propaganda in one article (or segment), and credible (sometimes downright revelatory) journalism in another.

At their best, conspiracy theorists are vigorous skeptics who demand a high standard of proof, and don't believe *any* story (official or otherwise) unless the evidence for it meets that high standard. At their worst, conspiracy theorists believe what they *want* to believe, in spite of evidence or contradictions in their own reasoning. The QAnon fanboys (and FBIAnon fanboys before him) fall into the latter category."	"&gt; What truth are you seeking with this “proof” you need? 

If someone makes an allegation, they need to have documentary evidence before I believe it to be true. Otherwise, I can say ""hey, that's interesting, I'll remember that and keep investigating,"" but I absolutely will *not* consider it the truth (or even factual), because it isn't.

&gt; We live in an era of fake news and shady intel supporting entire investigations.

Yes, which is why it's important not to accept unsubstantiated, anonymous claims as fact. We can investigate anonymous claims, and keep them in our minds as worth considering; but we cannot consider them *fact* until we have been provided proof.

&gt; there’s a lot of solid rabbit holes to go down.

I'm fine with this. The problem isn't people who say ""Q is probably a LARP, but he's entertaining and provides us with fun rabbitholes to investigate."" The problem is with people who accept his claims as absolute fact, when we don't even know if he is who he claims to be."	conspiracy	conspiracy	1

Don't be scared about the next guys you date. Some guys - like your current (hopefully soon to be ex) boyfriend may have issues with it - but then they aren't the ones for you. Plenty of guys wouldn't care...like the ones who aren't racist misogynists.	"OK, so I think your boyfriend probably just wants you to be happy and stable. As someone who's dated a guy who was going through similar issues (hated current job, was demoralized looking for a new one, didn't know what he wanted to do), it was really tough being supportive. I tried listening and being comforting, being supportive, helping look for a new job, suggesting exactly what your boyfriend has (that I train him in some skills I have)...but there's only so long you can watch or try helping someone who isn't helping themselves.

Look, I think your boyfriend is trying his best to be supportive and probably is just frustrated with not knowing how to best help you. And I know it's really hard to hate what you do and feel demoralized. But you need to spend some time - ignoring your boyfriend's opinions - and figure out what you want to pursue. Or you'll be sitting in a miserable cycle of self loathing forever. This is YOUR life. It's not too late to try something new. If you want to write, figure out a way to make enough money to support yourself while pursuing that. If that means doing some mindless job you don't care about (but don't hate), do that and pursue writing. "	relationships	relationships	1

"I'm quite the layperson, but isn't there a difference between schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder? To me (as a layperson), what you're describing sounds a bit like the latter.  

Anyway, the article says that if the brain hears a voice that it doesn't recognise as its own, the ""logical"" step for the brain is to conclude that it's someone else's voice, and the next ""logical"" step is to come up with a theory for how it's possible to hear what it's hearing. Since the brain ""knows"" that there's a stranger's voice, all the following conclusions will be subordinate to that ""fact"". 

Completely sane people come up with completely false theories based on just a fistful of data all the time. It's what the brain is built for, making a plausible model of the world based on the things it knows. It doesn't sound surprising to me that something like that could happen with such weird effects if a brain is wired wrong to begin with. Other posters here have talked about combating this phenomenon in themselves with information and reasoning, so, at least for this aspect of schizophrenia, it seems to me that a good understanding of how the brain works *and acceptance of the fact that everyone is at their brain's mercy*, i.e. the ego is not in control, might be a path to reasoning against the legitimacy of such voices."	todayilearned	todayilearned	1

These centrists would fix what Republicans and Third Way Democrats (their corporate shill peers in Congress) have increasingly broken since Nixon was first elected.  Policy-wise, we’re looking at fair trade restoration/free trade repeal, breaking up the monopolies/oligopolies that have formed since 1980, breaking up and regulating the financial industry, enforcing sensible immigration laws, ending the golden era of white collar crime in the U.S., bringing healthcare costs down to earth, etc. etc.  It took neoliberals decades to put the national economy, middle class and national budget in a ditch and it will take time to reverse that damage.  Europe faces the same challenges since leaders in Europe and the U.S. joined forces in championing a neoliberal reform agenda.

He ended up getting $500k up front and a $15k per-fight deal.  He got destroyed in the title fight, spent the $500k, then was stuck with a mutli-fight deal for $15k.  Which left him and many fans very salty.


In a lot of ways, this fight marked the death of the Nate Diaz that we used to love. He was never the same after that. "	MMA	MMA	1

414	"You've got the basic understanding right. In order to receive $10k worth of payments, a merchant must have sufficient balance across all of the channels in his wallet.

For this to be the case, between he and his channel partners, _at least_ $10k worth of BTC must be committed on-chain to these channels, **and** that 10k must currently be owed to his channel partner. That is to say, if the channel were to be closed at the beginning of the week, the partner would get $10k and Pizza Guy whatever remains.

As he collects payments over the course of the week, the balance will shift toward him. By the end of the week he is now owed the $10k in the event the channel were to be closed. But he doesn't close the channel since that's expensive. Instead he pays his supplier $5k for next week's sauce and dough. That shifts the balance of the channel to a $5k/$5k split.

Pizza Guy's receive capacity is only $5k, that's not enough for next week's income!"	"&gt;The new channel method is very similar, except you send a lightning payment to a service that makes a deal with you where, when you send them coins via lightning, they'll use those coins (minus a fee) to open a new channel to you -- thus almost doubling your original incoming capacity

This would result in the service essentially paying you with your own money. That doesn't make any sense. You need a liquidity provider willing to commit _their own funds_ to new channel.

&gt;The negative fees method is where you yourself begin using your channels to route payments for other people; and if one of your channels has no more incoming capacity, well, that means it has high outgoing capacity, so what you can do is offer to pay people a few satoshis to route their payments through your node in the outgoing direction. That way, as payments go outward through you, you'll send coins to the other side of your channel, which gives you incoming capacity.

Negative fees might work to rebalance channels, but it does not increase net capacity (or does so insubstantially). It can improve the ability to receive over different routes, but a merchant's total inbound capacity is still limited."	Bitcoin	Bitcoin	1

Other than that, [this new version of Fear not this Night, one of my favourite songs ever, got me curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilN1fylw3zY). as I said I played through all of the new Episodes but never heard this, or was in a situation where it was appropriate, so what's the context of this?

So you would zerg it and want guardians for their ""block next incoming attack"" utility and just repeat that 20+ times for 1 piece of gear. Repeat that for all slots and that's how you gear. 

That's about 5 years out of date.

Path of Fire does very little to change the end game, it has always been about farming and grinding for the stuff you want, rather than the stuff you need. Grinding for gear right now can be as much as getting enough gold to buy a full set from the trading post.

"Comparing the whole US to any single country is misleading. The US is a union of individual States with different demographics. Comparing say, Norway, (pop 5M) to, say,  Missouri (pop 6M) isn’t even accurate: Norway is a monoculture and effectively one ethnic group. Missourians are very different and are not a monoculture nor consider themselves a single ethnicity. This affects the outcome of how governments act. Further, the costs of living in many of these “successful” single payer systems are much higher, with lower quality of care compared to care available in the United States. The US has more than twice the number of MRI machines per 100,000 than Canada. And if single payer doesn’t preclude private care and insurance, then it ultimately admits that the care offered by the system is inferior to that offered privately.

Further, Sweden as an example shows that single payer fails markets when it misallocates resources because central planning cannot anticipate where resources are needed. Canada has to send cancer patients to the US for treatment after lengthy bureaucratic processes. In all systems where something is “free” there is overconsumption, evidenced in all of these systems.

And you still haven’t disproven how private plastic surgery has managed to become a lucrative industry available to the middle class. You’ve only stated you can’t see the forest through the trees. But it is, because their services are often not covered by insurance (imagine that) and lucrative markets draw labor. Nobody disputes that healthcare in the United States is absurdly expensive, but the problem isn’t lack of government or regulation: quite the opposite. Medicare and Medicaid price fix, leaving a lot of costs just to break even for hospitals and doctors to be paid by private parties. Insurers have become bargaining groups, cutting deals with providers for better rates. Because the government drove costs up, insurers instituted co-pay. And much of the cost is in paying people to file paperwork. Healthcare providers have inflated costs so the whittled down “deal” is closer to the actual expense. The market didn’t fail in health care, government is the problem. Single payer won’t fix it, because it’ll just cause exploding costs (so will “free” college a la Federal student loans).

446	"&gt;""I'm not a mind reader"" is a strawman defense.

Actually studies have repeatedly shown that women (on average) are indeed better at reading body language and facial expressions than men.   This is often described as ""having more empathy""; on the other hand, psychopaths (on average) are also better at reading body language and facial expressions, so I'm not sure B follows from A.   And 99 percent of the people who risk their lives to save others are, in fact, male.   

What is abundantly clear is that feminists have a distinct *lack* of empathy (using the word as its traditionally used) for men and boys.  Indeed the empathy gap is so vast as to resemble the grand canyon.   Whereas men go out of their way to try to make women feel comfortable, radically re-adjusting every institution to suite the demands of the most whiny, entitled women, feminists show zero interest -- let alone ability -- to adjust their behavior to suit the different predilections of men.   

We see this over, and over, and over and over again.   Women enter traditional male sphere ----&gt; men must radically alter their behavior.   It's never women enter traditional male sphere -------&gt; women adjust to new environment.    Do male nurses behave this way?  Nope.   They adjust to the new culture, they don't demand that all women change.      

&gt;I've seen conversations where the man's attention to that stuff is so poor he also has not noticed the woman and I exchanging glances including her literally rolling her eyes at his failure to pick up her repeated indications that she knows the subject well.

Again, this may well be a biological difference in the way men and women perceive things.   Men are much more direct and don't rely nearly as much on subtle body language and ""hints.""  I consider myself a fairly sensitive type (I cried at the end of Old Yeller, and I even cried when Andy Dufrane escaped from Shawshank; I oppose the death penalty; I support universal health care etc.), however when I was a young man I repeatedly missed the ""subtle signals"" of women coming onto me, they later explained.

You and other feminists need to practice empathizing with the opposite sex.   I know it's hard, but everything worthwhile is.  There's a great book called ""self-made man"" by the lesbian feminist Norah Vincent.   Although she gets a bunch of stuff wrong, she learned to put herself in men's shoes and realized, much to her shock, that men are not privileged at all.    

Warren Farrell also performed a number of role-reversal experiments in the 70's and 80's.   Interestingly he found that the men were happy to try putting themselves in women's shoes, but the women mostly left when it was time to put themselves in men's shoes.   The few women that stayed often had their views about gender shattered.   These sorts of experiments would actually be valuable for school children, as opposed to the ""teach boys about their toxic masculinity"" abuse.   

&gt;She can't just come out and say ""I know far more about this than you"" because that gets denied and he does the ""we're all entitled to our opinion"" false equality.

Actually she could do *exactly* that, and men would respect her far more for expressing herself directly rather than playing games or using cowardly, passive-aggressive gender slurs like ""mansplaining.""   "	Yes, she participated in the rapes and helped dispose of the bodies (with a big smile on her face).   I can't remember if she helped kill them.   	MensRights	MensRights	1

451	"Oh, I have no doubt that it's possible that something did happen during that game, I was just sceptical about the details you described (especially the coffin part). I'm sure Eagles fans are no angels, and that there's a reason they (and Philly fans in general) have that reputation.

Though these days, at least in my experience with Flyers fans, I have the feeling a lot of it is confirmation bias, too. People expect Philly sports fans to misbehave, so every incident they hear about that they'd probably not pay much mind to if it related to another team, they take conscious note of it. If a Philly fan in Pittsburgh had behaved like that one Pens fan in my section during last Monday's game, it would have been a textbook case of ""of course, the asshole is a Philly fan, what do you expect?"" Because it was the other way around, he was just an asshole, not a representation of how bad his city's sports fans are.

So it's probably a vicious circle. Some people act out because they're assholes, and the reputation is ruined, anyway, and with every incident everyone else just sees their prejudices about Philly fans confirmed."

"	"Brett Kollmann had a great breakdown on the Eagles roster a few months ago, and this was one of his big points in that video. Since LT changed the game teams have focused on the importance of the left tackle. In more recent years we have seen the vast majority of top pass rushers coming from the left (defenses perspective so lining up vs the right tackle) to go against the easier matchup and away from the elite pass protectors on the left side. Having an elite right tackle like Lane Johnson is the obvious response to that and we will start to see more and more elite right tackles in the future as GMs put more value on the position.

When a fire burns, it spreads. When it consumes all available fuel it dies out. 

When an economy is growing, that growth stimulates additional growth. When that growth reaches a critical threshold, other market forces come into play to cause a recession. That's why the economy has [natural fluctuations](http://visualeconsite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/RealGDPperCapita-650x450.png) with a general trend of growth.

Let's say I've started a company and I hire Bob as my first employee. If the economy were a zero sum game then that's it. Economy is over, no more growth, everyone go home. But since it's not, hiring Bob allows me to hire more people. After a month of having Bob help my around I've noticed that my profits are through the roof compared to when I was working alone. With this extra money I could afford to hire Alice and by next month's end my profits will be even higher and I can hire more people repeat ad infinitum until the effects of [diminishing marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) are felt.

But growth creating growth doesn't end there. Alice used to be a full time mom but now she's part of the workforce.

497	"&gt;He's not claiming that Islam is the first religion. He's claiming that those older religions were founded by a prophet of Allah 

That's called Islam. Muslims *do* believe that Islam is the first religion, they just think it started with Adam and not Muhammad."	"It's not ""all from paradise lost"", it's drawn from Isaiah 14:12-15, where the ""shining one, son of Dawn"" (*helel ben shahar*) is cast down from Yahweh's throne:

&gt;How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! You said in your heart, “I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of Zaphon; I will ascend to the tops of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High.” But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit.

This isn't originally about Satan, it's about Nebuchadnezzar II (using the imagery of Athtar's attempt to usurp Baal), but it is later interpreted as Satan. You should also refer to the fallen angels in literature like 1 Enoch:

&gt;And again the Lord said to Raphael: '*Bind Azazel hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness*: and make an opening in the desert, which is in Dudael, and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face that he may not see light. And on the day of the great judgement he shall be cast into the fire. 

This work was familiar to the writer of GMatthew, see Matthew 22:13

&gt;Then the king said to the attendants, ‘*Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness*, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

1 Enoch is in turn based on Genesis 6, which is originally about gods descending to earth and forming demigod children with mortal women, but these gods (sons of El) are later interpreted as angels. 

Also see Luke 10:18, where **Jesus says**:

&gt;**I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven**

and Revelation 12:7-9

&gt;And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. **The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.**

We might also look at the Quran, where Iblis (also known as Shaitan, and identified with Azazel) is cast down from paradise after refusing to bow to Adam. Surah 7:11-13

&gt;Indeed We created you, then We fashioned you, then We asked the angels: ""Prostrate yourselves before Adam."" They all prostrated accordingly except Iblis who did not join those who prostrated. Allah said: ""What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?"" He replied: ""I am better than he; you created me from fire and him from clay."" Allah said: ""Get down from here.

505	"&gt; I can't track down what right to deletion means in the GDPR but it should merely be very specific in that only your name must be deleted.

Your name isn't the only thing that can be used to connect the data with your person. That's why everything has to be deleted.

&gt; Any cases that resulted in a guilty verdict should be exempt from right to deletion. Citizens have a right to know what crimes have been committed and the news should have a right to spread that information.

Only if the person effected or the crime is of public interest. If the crimes of every citizen are public, there's no privacy and no rehabilitation. In countries, where the people take privacy more seriously, like Germany, the crime record of a person is a thing between the person and the state and no one else. The publication of mug shots in the US is seen as barbaric, here.

&gt; And the biggest and most complex one of all. Who has the right to collect what data for how long

What? Complex? No, this is very simple. Anyone that has explicit consent by the person, whose data is collected, as long as they state the reason for collecting the data and for the duration that this reason is valid/the data is necessary. This has been the law here in Germany for a long time.

&gt; Really this whole law should be thoroughly crafted in cooperation with industries in order to understand what information is useful and for how long it is useful.

That can only be decided on a case by case basis, which is why the requirement for stating the reason of the aggregation exists.

&gt; There is data I want a company to hold in perpetuity. All my games should hold all of my login information for as long as my account exists for example.

&gt; I can't tell if the law was rushed or if they wanted to right crappy vague laws on purpose or if it's just a failure to write out in laymans terms what changes need to be made to be in compliance.

506	"I'm on ADWD in a re read right now, and just finished a Dany chapter. I now, without a doubt, believe that the Red Door was in Dorne and is not a red herring. 


&gt;She found herself remembering her nightmare. Sometimes there is truth in dreams. Could Hizdahr zo Loraq be working for the warlocks, was that what the dream had meant? Could the dream have been a sending? Were the gods telling her to put Hizdahr aside and wed this Dornish prince instead? **Something tickled at her memory.** ""Ser Barristan, what are the arms of House Martell?"" 

&gt;""A sun in splendor, transfixed by a spear.""

This is after Quentyn presents her with the marriage pact. Obviously the memory being tickled at here is meant to be the memory of Quaithe warning her of the Sun's son - but right before this we get:

&gt; Dany unrolled the parchment and examined it again. Braavos. **This was done in Braavos, while we were living in the house with the red door. Why did that make her feel so strange?** 

There are several mentions of the Red Door in ADWD, and its connection to Braavos in her memory, prior to the above passage. 

&gt;She had been **dreaming of a house with a red door** when Missandei woke her. There had been no time to dress. 

Dany I

&gt;Something is wrong, she knew at once. ""Is it Daario? What's happened?"" In her dream they had been man and wife, simple folk who lived a simple life **in a tall stone house with a red door**. 

Dany II

&gt;Dany had never known a home. **In Braavos, there had been a house with a red door,** but that was all. ""Beware of Qartheen bearing gifts, especially merchants of the Thirteen. There is some trap here. 

Dany III

And after our marriage pact chapter we get

&gt;She would rather have drifted in the fragrant pool all day, eating iced fruit off silver trays and **dreaming of a house with a red door**, but a queen belongs to her people, not to herself. 

Dany IX

and

&gt;Not since those **half-remembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door** had she been as happy. 


Every time the red door is mentioned it is either flanked  by dreams and half remembered memories, or tied to her idea of Braavos. 

&gt;That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever. 

AGOT Dany I

We know the house was large and tall and made of stone. We know that there was a lemon tree outside her window. We know that Dany believes this was a time where they were living with Ser Willem and that when he died they were put out of the house. 

&gt;It was Dragonstone where she had been born. In her mind's eye they **burned with a thousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind's eye, all the doors were red.**

AGOT Dany III

&gt;She did take a dozen flasks of scented oils, the perfumes of her childhood; she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could see the big house with the red door once more. 

AGOT Dany VI

&gt;Ser Jorah's face was drawn and sorrowful. ""Rhaegar was the last dragon,"" he told her. He warmed translucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was there and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. ""The last dragon,"" he whispered, thin as a wisp, and was gone. **She felt the dark behind her, and the red door seemed farther away than ever...The red door was so far ahead of her, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her.** If it caught her she would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness. She began to run...The door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold receding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the green rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. **She could smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and arms to keep her warm, there.** She threw open the door. 

AGOT Dany IX (notice above she suggests that the red door, and presumably warmth, is far ahead of her while ice and darkness is behind her)

Dany often associates the red door with happiness and warmth and light (and oils). Which is not in line with what we know of Braavos to be (through Arya and Sam's chapters). We know that there are lemons in Dorne, that heat and fragrant food and warmth and light and colors of sunset paint the place. 

I'm convinced that Dany's red door was in or near Dorne - but more confusing is, if Dany was in Westeros when Ser Willem died (and the servants caring for them seemed to care little for the children, even as political prizes, once Ser Willem died) then how did they manage to flee across the narrow sea? 

"	"&gt;even if GRRM manages to finish TWOW &amp; ADOS, he won't bother reading them because it took to long. The frustration of the long wait went as far as changing his opinion of the books. He used to love and now less so. 

I hate these people. Hype fans. 

&gt;He made the argument that if J.K Rowling took as long as GRRM to finish the Harry Potter series, it wouldn't feel as frustrating because each Harry Potter book, apart from the penultimate one have closure. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end. They all begin with Harry at his aunt &amp; uncle's,  right before the start of the school year at Hogwarts, a mystery goes down at Hogwarts, Harry &amp; his friends resolve the mystery, and the school year ends. 

Well Harry Potter is a children's/YA book. Of course its structured like that. ASOIAF has a beginning, middle, and end too; even if each book doesn't end with Jon going back to live with Cat each year. 

&gt;If J.K Rowling never finished Harry Potter, sure there would be the disappointment that Harry never faced his end game battle with Voldemort, but at least there would have been satisfaction that he won his last battle. Apart from the penultimate book, Harry Potter &amp; the Half Blood Prince, every book is a battle that Harry goes through and wins. There is always closure to his story arc. 

This might be true up until GOF. Once Voldemort made his official return, people would have wondered about his reign of terror and Harry's destiny.

507	"&gt; The big deal is if there is liquid water.

Except it's not such a big deal considering the circumstances. It's sub-zero, extremely salty water. Salt reduces the freezing point of water, as much as approx. -50C. They think the lake on Mars is around -10C to -20C. Or rather ""in"" Mars, as it's about 20kms under the ice.

Most likely that area of ice was frozen like the rest, but slowly acquired salt from surrounding minerals. Over a very long time, the increasing salt content ""un-froze"" the ice in that area, which slowly grew into a large area of extremely cold but liquid water.

So keep in mind this isn't the same as finding a standing lake of freshwater on another planet. Whether microbes are able to live in those conditions in the Martian ""lake"" - surrounded by ice and extremely salty, and whatever other acids or chemicals might be in there as well - is anyone's guess.

ed: The ""real deal"" would be finding liquid water on a planet which doesn't require these special, extreme circumstances to be liquid. Usually when referring to ""liquid water"" as a prerequisite for life, they mean a planet at the right distance from its sun so that water remains liquid on its own, at a reasonable temperature range, so that life can thrive. We don't really know if life can thrive in extremely salty water at -20C trapped under 20kms of ice. Some extreme forms of bacteria perhaps, but not much more."

514	"Hmm... Maybe in a few years. The challenging part is in this area of tech everything moves so fast, so if you aren't working super hard to stay on the cutting edge, you start getting stale. I read these tales of woe where a tech worker gets a comfy job for 5-10 years, then they lose their job or something, and they are now in their 40s and unemployable. That doesn't happen though if you stay on the cutting edge and learn the latest tech. Whereas in many other fields the rate of change is slower, so experience compounds and you don't need to worry about falling behind.

If you are willing to try and stay on the cutting edge though, the industry rewards you with a ridiculous amount of money. I guess, for better or worse, I'm a workaholic, so it's okay for me.

516	"&gt;""I'm not a mind reader"" is a strawman defense.

Actually studies have repeatedly shown that women (on average) are indeed better at reading body language and facial expressions than men.   This is often described as ""having more empathy""; on the other hand, psychopaths (on average) are also better at reading body language and facial expressions, so I'm not sure B follows from A.   And 99 percent of the people who risk their lives to save others are, in fact, male.   

What is abundantly clear is that feminists have a distinct *lack* of empathy (using the word as its traditionally used) for men and boys.  Indeed the empathy gap is so vast as to resemble the grand canyon.   Whereas men go out of their way to try to make women feel comfortable, radically re-adjusting every institution to suite the demands of the most whiny, entitled women, feminists show zero interest -- let alone ability -- to adjust their behavior to suit the different predilections of men.   

We see this over, and over, and over and over again.   Women enter traditional male sphere ----&gt; men must radically alter their behavior.   It's never women enter traditional male sphere -------&gt; women adjust to new environment.    Do male nurses behave this way?  Nope.   They adjust to the new culture, they don't demand that all women change.      

&gt;I've seen conversations where the man's attention to that stuff is so poor he also has not noticed the woman and I exchanging glances including her literally rolling her eyes at his failure to pick up her repeated indications that she knows the subject well.

Again, this may well be a biological difference in the way men and women perceive things.   Men are much more direct and don't rely nearly as much on subtle body language and ""hints.""  I consider myself a fairly sensitive type (I cried at the end of Old Yeller, and I even cried when Andy Dufrane escaped from Shawshank; I oppose the death penalty; I support universal health care etc.), however when I was a young man I repeatedly missed the ""subtle signals"" of women coming onto me, they later explained.

You and other feminists need to practice empathizing with the opposite sex.   I know it's hard, but everything worthwhile is.  There's a great book called ""self-made man"" by the lesbian feminist Norah Vincent.   Although she gets a bunch of stuff wrong, she learned to put herself in men's shoes and realized, much to her shock, that men are not privileged at all.    

Warren Farrell also performed a number of role-reversal experiments in the 70's and 80's.   Interestingly he found that the men were happy to try putting themselves in women's shoes, but the women mostly left when it was time to put themselves in men's shoes.   The few women that stayed often had their views about gender shattered.   These sorts of experiments would actually be valuable for school children, as opposed to the ""teach boys about their toxic masculinity"" abuse.   

&gt;She can't just come out and say ""I know far more about this than you"" because that gets denied and he does the ""we're all entitled to our opinion"" false equality.

Actually she could do *exactly* that, and men would respect her far more for expressing herself directly rather than playing games or using cowardly, passive-aggressive gender slurs like ""mansplaining.""   "	"Jesus.   I didn't think even a feminist would stoop this low.

518	"I would probably take this. 

Having CMC, Mixon, and Howard gives you three top 15 RBs. You also have two stud WRs and a terrific WR3 in Corey Davis, so I think the value there exceeds the value of having Tate. Cook, Ajayi, and Tate all have downsides too. 

- Cook will get the volume and the opportunity, and he will be catching passes, but he's coming off that ACL which doesn't mean he's just an instant success, like there could be some caution and limited use when he returns. Not to mention, Latavius Murray proved effective last year and could easily steal some valuable touches near the goal line. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, their o-line is really banged up and already shaky as is, so his efficiency could really struggle especially if they turn him into the focal point of the offense. 
- Ajayi has never proven himself as a workhorse back, and with Sproles, Smallwood, and Clement still alive I don't know the extent to which he will step up this year. He's a really boom/bust guy who doesn't score much and is frequently injured. 
- Tate is 30, on a team with a lot of mouths to feed in Tate, Jones Jr., Golladay, Kerryon Johnson, LG Blount, and Riddick. He'll do fine especially in PPR, but he has a limited ceiling because of the lack of TDs and the fact that he's not going to be getting any better or anything. 

CMC and Howard are both great this year. CMC will be the focal point of the offense and will see tons of volume, especially in the passing game. In PPR he's super valuable. Meanwhile, Howard was just announced as a three down back in an offense that likes to throw the ball, suggesting that Cohen won't be the problem we previously thought and he'll remain a workhorse back in an improved offense, even seeing increased targets. Terrific RB1/2 duo to couple with Mixon. "	"Wouldn't take this. 

MG/Lenny is such a stud RB1/2 duo, and MG has tons of upside given his insane usage, terrific pass attack in LA, and improved o-line. There are so many question marks with Ingram and Shady: 

- I think there are conflicting schools of thought on Ingram; I actually kind of like him, but there's risk. Basically, New Orleans fucking hates him, and he's on a contract year. Either a) they run him into the ground or b) they don't use him nearly as much as previously. I really don't know which it'll be, even though I would think they run him into the ground given the high powered offense and two-headed monster in the backfield. But I don't think there's solid evidence to suggest either option is inherently what the Saints will do. No matter what, Kamara is the back of the future, has more talent, and will likely outplay him in almost every way. 
- Shady is 30, has a trash pass attack, an awful o-line, and a bad defense that'll necessitate a lot of airing it out. He'll get insane volume, but he'll also have defenses focusing a ton on him since he's Buffalo's only real effective weapon. 

You have 3 top 13 RBs, some solid WRs in Mike, Jeffery, Edelman, Garcon, and Lockett (a nice mix of depth and upside), a good TE and an interesting bench piece in Dion Lewis (sorry but Marlon Mack is the garbageman lol). No need to make this trade since you don't need RB depth, and you'd be trading one of the safest RB options for some really risky guys who would almost certainly not be really needed on your team.

A lot of people seem to overlook the fact that when his E is on cooldown, the damage he takes isn't converted into grey health so I did the best I could by giving myself incremental shields, which is a lot more efficient than giving yourself one huge shield that will expire before all the damage can be soaked up.

The difference between my clip and Trick2G's is that: 1) I was tanking two consecutive Nexus tower shots at once, 2) I don't have 40% CDR like Trick did, and 3) Udyr's Turtle stance actually gives him so much sustain + Spirit Visage + a Red buff (to a lesser extent) since he was healing off of minions.

527	"Another easily justifiable response would be operating under the presumption that most of her family is very religious.. seeing as her husband is a preacher.. then to say another very common response to chronic illness / illnesses mixed with your house burning down would be that anybody might struggle with their faith.. they might believe god is punishing or hates them. Probably wouldn’t help that the church is gossiping about you. I wouldn’t show up either lol.

"I don’t know.. the OP did not sell me her story. It sounds heavily biased and a lot of it sounds formed out of gossip. I accidentally replied to the bottom of the post so I’ll try and rephrase what I said. 

Basically I can easily give you a scenario that I’ve witness first hand, that can easily justify why an individual chooses not to involve family in their healthcare. The simple answer is judgements or perceived judgement. It’s very common with patients who are very fatigued / depressed to no longer want to participate in activities their significant other values. So scenario here would be an argument, that im willing to bet happened / happens very frequently. The family member / spouse invalidates their physical state by comparing their choice to do “x event” but then can’t go to church with them on Saturday / Sunday (sorry don’t know the denomination) anyways this is the first step in a passive aggressive battle of interpersonal doubt from a family member or loved one. Those two groups of people specifically are most likely to be hurt by your absence from things that are important to them and thus the most likely to orchestrate doubt about your illnesses. You know since most people are not very mindful of the way things affect them, when they feel hurt they have a broad spectrum of responses.

Also I would be interested to know more about this Fire Marshall thing. Part of the duties of a Fire Marshall is to investigate arsonry and it’s hard for me to imagine a Fire Marshall wouldn’t investigate simply because it’s a preachers house.. that means a) she’s admitting the Fire Marshall covered up insurance fraud and that he personally admitted that to someone or b) it’s ill informed gossip."	relationship_advice	relationship_advice	1
528	"&gt; I believe God should be the standard because he is the rightful owner of mankind.

But how does ownership of mankind make something a standard of morality? How does one apply morality in the case that the only way something is somehow 'moral' is by whatever the whim of this owner is? How do you get moral pronouncements from that? I mean, are you aware of the Euthyphro Dilemma at all and why the idea of Divine Command Theory makes morality completely arbitrary just by saying: ""What God says is good because it's what God says."" It's a dictatorship.

I mean, think about it: if we use your moral reasoning, unless your god tells you-- as in actually somehow manages to communicate to you some specific command at any point-- nothing you do is moral _or_ immoral. Whether it's giving to charity, praying, killing-- these things are good only if your god tells you to do them in the moment that you should. You can't have 'love thy neighbour' and 'kill the men but take the women and children as your plunder' both as acting edicts because there will be a contradiction, and yet you say that both are good because your god commands it, so either there's a contradiction there, or only anything done the moment that your god specifically and directly commands it of the individual or group is when it becomes good. 

&gt; If you own anyone, yes you should be able to do anything with them - that’s the definition of owning anything.

So you have no moral objections to this at all? You think this is _good?_ According to the bible, if I own you, I also own your children. I can beat you, and your children, and if one of them is a girl, I can use her how I please. And in the same light, if you own somebody, you can do the same. Beat them, sell them, have sex with them. I mean, you own them, right? Why have compassion for what you own if you can do anything you want to them? _That's_ the morality you advocate for? Because if so, I hope you don't ever teach that to your own children. "	"Metaphorically, you mean. Not literally. Otherwise, going by your definition, money is a moral standard too. But how does money tell you what to do? Money doesn't talk, give commands, or have a son to sacrifice to a cross. Or am I going to assume that you go by a non-standard definition for the word 'literally' as well?

See, I think that ultimately, this is all just a dodge. Mental gymnastics at its finest, so that one doesn't have to actually answer the hard questions that their stance on morality and god poses for them. It's the problem I've had when I was a Christian and it was the same answer too many people gave. They'd rather abandon their ability to empathize with their fellow person rather than come to grips with the idea that they've essentially placed the god of Christianity into a position of complete dictatorial power where morality becomes arbitrary at the whim of a being that can decide that child rape is 'good' tomorrow. They'll tell me that slavery is okay, that taking men and women for plunder is fine, and that killing one's own child is a moral imperative so long as their god tells them to, without pausing for a second and thinking ""how is this a fair and good system of morality?"" It's part of the reason why I'm no longer a Christian. 

We've gotten this far into the discussion and you've barely answered any of my questions, and I'm convinced that you're going to do everything in your power to deflect and equivocate definitions in order to avoid doing so.

This is the veteran perspective. Pros don't understand how it is to not play the game for hours every day and learn every new thing.

551	well they're both branches of the Germanic language tree. Modern German is nothing like the language that would become Old Norse which became Icelandic, it's a different branch on the Germanic tree. [Here's a language tree,](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/language.gif) it's like a phylogeny but for languages instead of organisms. Icelandic and German have a 'common ancestor' that was spoken... probably in the late bronze or early iron age around 500 BC-ish (I'm a historian not a linguist--but I work with linguistic analysis on occasion--so I can't give you a faithful timeline of this, but the dates linguists give us is an estimate which is based on what we know of linguistic evolution. There are no exact dates here, only estimates. Heck, even as a medievalist with texts galore all I can do is give an estimated range of dates sometimes. I know some people I can ask for a better idea of the time frames we're talking about here, if you really want to know). Proto-germanic is a reconstructed language, we have no writing in it. We barely have anything contemporary in Old Norse, the Iron age Scandinavians through to the vikings were an oral culture--runic inscriptions were few and far between, and even then extremely brief. So we don't consider that culture to be literate, even though they did have an alphabet. The sagas weren't carved in runes but written down after the spread of Christianity brought the Latin alphabet to Northern Europe. Of course runes are still valuable archaeological evidence, especially in that they corroborate the myths and stories passed down until they could be written down (we know certain stories were told in that time period and not made up by medieval writers because we can match inscriptions, a drawing of Thor fishing for example).	English is a Germanic language and FRENCH is Romance. Modern English is mixed with Norman French. ...if you would have read what I said??	askscience	askscience	1
552	"FFS you asked questions and i answered them. Derailed indeed. Yes i have read those authors and i disagree with you.  ""I explained how state ownership is not socialism by any academic definition, you still insist that it is despite being wrong"" in your opinion, it doesn't make a different opinion wrong, try reading some modern historians rather than looking only at the source material, or look in academic subjects other than philosophy. ""Except academic discourse and jargon is separate from the common use. Stick to academic definitions when talking about academia, makes sense?"" still pretty important if you are approaching it from a political, historical or sociological perspective so yes it should be used. It does matter as it is the correct use in those disciplines, like it or not it is the academic language in those disciplines because they are looking at something completely different to the philosophy of those writers alone. Historians need to know what laymen meant to understand sources and use the terminology as they do. Make sense? Why can't you wrap your head around this? I am a historian, historians have different views, different approaches, a different approach or an evolved topic doesn't mean difference is wrong. Just because Engels wrote with Marx does't mean he agreed with everything he did, his concepts were more diffuse Marx is insanely formulaic (Also i specialise in Russian history i am aware Lenin massively messed with Marx for his own convenience and created a stop gap, probably because Marx's theories don't work in practice). You didn't even know what economic determinism was? Which is Marxist historiography 101. Don't believe me? Try looking at Marxist historians or the historiography of Marx's work (historiography does not mean history of it means the history of historical writing on a given subject).  I am not talking philosophy i am talking history which is what this thread was about. It isn't my opinion it is the reality of my profession. The writers of Marx's time agree on those things yes but we are still trying to work out what collective ownership means in practice, why not state ownership, if the formula doesn't work maybe it's broken? that is what historians do they question these theories and formulas constantly and look at how society adapts and reflects ideas. The philosophical writers were in consensus but humanity had to figure out the pragmatics and logistics which puts them up for debate as far as historians are concerned. 

Geographers will treat an issue very differently to a sociologist. So of course a historian is going to have a different take to an economist, philosopher or politician. I am not saying you don't know Marx, you clearly do, but you don't know the discipline of history I am trying to explain that in the discipline of history and sociology the subject is treated very differently. But of course i don't know my job, and have a different viewpoint so must me wrong? really? What i have said is the view of Marx and socialism in the discipline of history. If you dislike it fine, if you think it should only be used in philosophy fine, or only in history when the formula fits fine. But i can't change my professions approach or viewpoint because it is fundamentally different to your approach. I'm not confused in the slightest. For historians socialism can have absolutely nothing to do with Marx or his buddies. Again you might not like or agree with it, i frequently don't but it is the case. Stop explaining Marx to me and arguing philosophical terms, i get it this is history it is fundamentally different. Philosophy's definition of Marxism does not bind Histories, they might all use the same term, historians don't. Like it or leave it, think it's right or wrong but that what it is for historians. There is our approach do what you will with it. *shrug* It simple you don't like other disciplines approach to Marx that is fine but they are legitimate and they exist. There are many historians that i fundamentally disagree with, their views are still as legitimate as mine. Again you don't have to like it but that is the situation for historians nothing i can or want to do about it. Again, minus my opinion the Marx's formulas don't work in practice, this is just a statement/summery of the professions view. You can argue all you like but it has nothing to do with me. It is ok you think it is wrong but i am telling you that is how Marxism is viewed by Historians. It is a free for all everything in history is. "	"..... Seriously i am a historian i know my terms i know what i am referencing, i am referring to economic determinism which is a completely different thing to dialectical history. Your definition of dialectical history is correct but it isn't at all what economic determinism is. Completely different concepts completely different schools of thought. One is not more popular than the other they are completely different things. Two separate branches of Marxist historiography. But Marxist historiography is not the be all and end all. For example look at the construct of genocide, formed in the 1940s by Lemkin. The term did not exist before him, but the term has evolved and adapted as a theory. His parameters for its definition proved unworkable and it has evolved in both meaning and application. Marx does not forever define what socialism is in the same way Lemkin's musings on genocide are not final. Marx is the reason we use the word ""class"" instead of ""rank"" and ""order"" his work does not define everything relating to the word ""class"". Current definitions by sociologists of what makes and individual a different class will be very different from Marx, that does not make them wrong.

Don't be hemmed into defining Marx economically. He was also a philosopher and a historian his work encompassed a hell of a lot more. And i said at least partially socialist economies which even under your definition is true of most governments, no government is purely capitalist, all economies have socialist aspects. Socialism is not purely defined by Marx.

Again there is a lot more to the concept than economics although disappointingly most people seem to get fixated on it completely ignoring the political as social aspects of his work, and the fact that the theories now extend and have evolved beyond his work. Nationalisation of healthcare, rail networks and other services is absolutely a socialist political stance and an economic one. Again economic socialism does not always go hand in hand with political socialism. "	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1
553	This sounds a bit like my ex-husband's story--his 1st wife had a kid during her first marriage, although it wasn't actually her husband's. She divorced him quickly and moved onto another and divorced him before settling down with her 3rd husband (the one I later married) by age 25. He had custody of a child from a previous relationship so they each adopted the other's kids and had one together. Once the last one was born she divorced my ex and went through two more marriages by age 30, leading me to refer to my then-husband as Third of Five.	"Definitely a Trek fan, as was her 6th husband, who thought it was hilariously funny when he learned of my then-husband's 'designation'.

He's very predictable.  You get in close, whack him a couple times, which will make him initiate his close range spinning attack, which you either block or roll through.

Or he'll teleport away, which means he's about to drop that long range ""hammer"" blow on you.  You have to reset the camera rapidfire so you know where he teleported to (usually behind or to your side), and immediately start running perpendicular to him until he's about to come down with the hammer, then just roll so he can't ""track"" you with the attack.

Once that's done, you just go back to close range.  Rinse and repeat, with a bit of orb dodging thrown in for good measure."	"Yeah, Sulyvahn was the closest I got to another Ornstein &amp; Smough (I think I died 20+ times against those guys).

556	"This week has been a pretty crappy week, I decided enough was enough and finally reported the creep who has been making sexual comments and suggestions to me since he started two months ago and I need to vent a little bit, sorry it's a bit long:  


A little background - I work in a small office which runs the logistics, customer service, sales and technical departments for a bespoke engineering company and work closely with my buddy, lets call him Bud, in the loading bay as one of my responsibilities is being in charge of the logistics for all the custom jobs shipping out across the world. I've been there for almost two years and have loved most of it as it is very chilled, good environment, busy but easy work. I came from a previous role in a high stress environment in a mid level manager position for a huge global company. I hated my last job and this role gave me the opportunity to start a new career with a smaller company who as luck would have it was 5mins from my house. 

I was the first woman in this office, entire building actually including the metalwork shop and factory, so they made great efforts to make sure I was comfortable which included making the now uni-sex toilet have a lock on the outside door as well as my own Ladies Stall I didn't need to share with the guys and it had it's own lady sign and everything. I brought in baked goods sometimes which everyone went nuts about since no one had ever done it before. It was very nice but of course in an environment with mostly men there were some comments and jokes which were a bit too crude so if I ever felt like it was too much I just said so and that was that -they'd say something along the lines of ""oh sorry, didn't mean to offend!"" and it didn't happen with the same person again. They respected my boundaries and there was no issue and we all got along great.

&amp;#x200B;

Until this idiot started on the assembly line near where Bud has his station. He's old enough to be my dad, seemed normal and friendly at first but within a week he started making comments about how I'm so pretty, how I look like I have made an effort for the guys by once wearing a dress (bearing in mind this dress was a woolly knitted sack with zero shape I found this an odd comment) or how my coming to speak with Bud a few times a day, for work related matters, was clearly an effort to come speak with the guys on the assembly line.

I started getting annoyed with his obviously sexual comments so the first time I said something to him was simply ""stop, that's making me feel uncomfortable"" which did not even register, he continues his comments and I continue to make remarks back about how creepy he is being thinking he will surely get the message if I continue to shut him down.

Alas, he did not.

Last week he made an absolutely disgusting comment to me on the phone when I rang down for Bud and I told him there and then on the phone that it was a horrible comment and that he better watch his fucking manners and mouth in future.

I told Bud about this incident and he was pissed off and said he would speak with Idiot about it if I wanted him to but Bud's not the boss so I said to leave it for now and that hopefully my quite crude response to this last incident had been successful.

Alas, it was not.

This Wednesday there were two more incidents, one face to face with witnesses and the other when he again picked up Buds phone and made a gross sexual comment and I had enough. I told him that was the last straw and hung up.

&amp;#x200B;

I reported this to my boss who listened in horrified silence of all the encounters I relayed, then asked me what I wanted to do and I said I just wanted this to stop, that I had tried to deal with it myself but clearly Idiot is TOO much of an idiot to listen to me so perhaps being told by a man would register in his troglodyte brain. We do not need to speak for work so we do not need to interact for any reason.

Next day I come in and go about my day, I go speak with Bud in the morning to plan our day of shipping and as I am walking away Idiot approaches me and says ""darling, darling, apparently I owe you an apology""..

&amp;#x200B;

M-f\*cker I am NOT your darling and if you have to make a point of adding ""apparently"" in that sentence you're a fucking dick who clearly does not get the issue at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I just put my hand up and said I am not talking to him and walk back to the office where my boss is waiting to speak with me. He tells me that during their chat Idiot admitted saying all those things but was ""flabbergasted"", ""shocked"" and maintained that he had simply been joking and having a laugh with me and that he would apologize to me profusely when he saw me. 

I could not have rolled my eyes any further back into my skull without them betting stuck. As did my boss. Of COURSE he was joking now that he got busted.

My boss had then said to him not to approach me or speak with me AT ALL until he had a chance to speak with Bud, the other witnesses and me again and of course this had been ignored with the shittiest apology ever, which I advised my boss of. He actually facepalmed that the guy had not only approached me when specifically told not to but also - that apology... he had to visibly restrain himself. I give him kudos.

I re-iterated that I just wanted this to stop and that Idiot just needs to not speak with me full stop.

Boss asked me if I was sure that was ok and that if I wanted to take things further it was my right to do so but I just want to get on with my work and stupidly thought my boss would get through to this moron. I would consider it settled with just a note on his records.

&amp;#x200B;

Alas, he did not.

Yesterday a colleague who works with Idiot came to tell me all the nasty things he has been saying to a couple of guys on the line since he came out of the meeting with my boss. Making a joke and a mockery out of the whole incident. Picking up nuts &amp; bolts &amp; saying things like ""i would say i have some nuts in my hand but that would be sexual harassment"". Saying I clearly have no sense of humor because he WAS joking, he's just having a fucking laugh, it was banter, calm down bitch.

So I reported this to my boss and told him what I had been GENEROUSLY prepared to let go with a warning was now no longer settled because Idiot cannot keep his mouth shut, trying to turn people against me with lies and has clearly not learned anything at all and I am taking this further. I'm fucking fuming!

&amp;#x200B;

then to top this fucking week off I put my phone in the washing machine, currently trying to resuscitate it in rice, and my doctor has referred me to hospital to scan and biopsy this lump that has appeared in my breast. Fuck sake.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks if you read this, I just needed to vent, it's been a bad week.

My friend, John, was with his girlfriend, Joanna, since they were around 15. We were all best friends in high school along with a small group of friends. Over the years some friends dropped off but there were still a few of us left, we would hang out once a week and drink/hang out. John and Joanna got engaged to each other a few years ago, the rest of the group didn't really like Joanna because she always seemed to have one foot out the door, but we were happy for John. 

Last November John called us all and let us know that he and Joanna had broken up because she cheated on him with multiple guys. I can't say I was shocked because she never really seemed trustworthy. What did shock me was when she called me and asked if I wanted to join her for a drink. I turned her down and let John know, turns out she had called our other friends too asking the same question. John was really hurt and we all tried our best to be there for him and help anyway we could. 

Fast forward to last week, John calls us all again and tells us that he's getting back together with Joanna and we should all get together and hang out. Immediately I hate this idea because I really don't respect her as a person after what she did. But after thinking about it for a while, I find myself not respecting John either, why would he get back together with someone who treated him so poorly? 

TLDR: Friend got back together with a cheating ex, expects us all to be friends again. I can't respect him or his decision. Any advice on how to move forward?

Then in the middle ages when the only people who could read or write were members of the church locked away from society up in monasteries making copies of bibles with no form of peer review or body of people there to make sure the story couldn't be changed all went ahead and made changes to the story in accordance to whatever the pope at the time wanted to incorporate into the bible to ensure the Catholic Church's dominance in peoples day to day lives. 

Fast forward another 1000 years and you have people citing their reason for God being real and Jesus being his son as ""well it's written in the bible."" "	"Disclaimer: I'm not religious what so ever....

So if a priest is convicted of child molestation and it's proven, at that point I believe they would no longer be ordained. Meaning up until that point when the church condemns them they can give a blessing of any sort as an actual catholic priest. 

That being said if you're argument is that they lose their credibility the moment the act occurs (the act being molesting a child or some other heinous crime/sin), then I would in a sense also agree this is the case as it would be considered a sin I believe to molest a child, and therefore the priest would no longer be on a moral path to his god, but rather to some version of Hell. However the sin of the priest doesn't invalidate the beliefs of the people performing the Eucharist, and presumably the ritual was conducted the same way otherwise. So why would the Wafer and Wine be any less symbolic or meaningful to the believer who is otherwise unaware of the Priests misdeeds and themselves still presumably on a righteous path to their god? 

Following that logic is like saying a famous atheist scientist who made a startling and impactful discovery would have their work be invalidated if they were to later be found out to have mollested a child or any other crime of the sort. 

Or if you'd like another analogy, it would be like saying Bill Cosby's comedy or Kevin Spacey's acting were to no longer be considered good simply because of the disgusting criminal acts they were later exposed of.

I would argue that in major cities most people aren't looking for ""nice stuff"" but simply an affordable place to live (and decent schools).  

For example, the vast majority of NYC's housing inventory isn't ""luxury"" or even that nice, but they simply haven't been building enough middle-income housing to meet the organic demand.  

The fact is that the ""nice stuff"" has gone mostly to investors - made up of a good deal of illicit/questionable foreigners - who are willing to pay almost ANY price to hide their money.  Builders have responded to this demand and also partly due to the construction/labor/regulation/land costs that almost make luxury market building a logical financial choice.

You make comments that show you don't have the slightest clue about market pricing (""but not proportionally to the benefit of the transfers because people will spend money on stuff that isn't rents."") which makes an incredibly naive suggestion that, in this case, rent pricing and markets can only move as far as the whole market spends on rent; without taking into account that it is a rolling phenomenon that only needs to involve a portion of the whole population to define its price.  Market pricing can move higher without everyone simultaneously actively participating and prices can be driven higher by higher priced offers (via limited supply or sellers that know they can expect higher bids).  Your comments don't even take speculative forces and their impact on supply into account.  It is as if you are oblivious to what is presently taking place in many rent/buy residential markets in the United States, where rents/house prices are becoming higher portions of incomes due to limited supply, partly thanks to increased speculation.

No haste also means the opponent has a full turn cycle to deal with it.

If you are flooding out with no board presence Tilonalli's Summoner isn't going to get you back in the game.

608	"The core algorithm seems pretty simple; can you translate it into pseudocode and an explanation of values/correctness? There's a lot of stuff in there to generate the UI, and there's not many comments.

I'll go off the linked PDF for now. I'm assuming you need to calculate the value of the formula. I'll assign names to parts: SAT = SUM 2^(var_j), where var\_j is SUM v\_(something) 2^i. Let's ignore the calculation of var\_j. It's clear that var\_j has at most 2^(number of variables) bits; since addition is O(number of bits), we have that the formula is exponential.

Anyway, this is very difficult to reason about. There aren't any proofs of correctness or even an explanation of what's going on. Your earlier example where you worked out the problem I gave was very understandable; I hope you see my argument that the naive solution presented is infeasible.

&gt; I'm pretty sure you and others came and started arguing with me.

I was just confused by what you were saying. You offered some not-very-well-explained solution and seem to imply that you've solved SAT.

&gt; Yet, still no widely accepted proof of PvNP.

Care to give it a try? Mathematics is hard. Fermat's last theorem went unproven for 358 years.

&gt; That means there's lots of solutions to choose from.

Patently false. In the case of a single clause, yes. But in general you have **lots** of (sparse) clauses, each of which cuts down the solution space exponentially. (And before you start arguing about that, remember that *the whole problem is trying to find something in the (possibly small or empty) solution space*.)"	"I see. So basically you negate the statement and use DeMorgan's law to turn NOT ((A OR ~B) AND (~A OR B)) for example to ((~A AND B) OR (A AND ~B)) and check if that is valid.

The problem with this is exactly that you don't account for clauses that don't use every variable. I believe that this particular variation of SAT (where each conjunct uses every variable) is then not NP-complete. To handle this, you'd have to either expand the missing variables (exponential) or increase your search space (to one which is exponential)."	programming	programming	1

612	"The [p-adic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number) are something like this, but they're a rather technical construction and definitely not compatible with the ordinary conception of the real numbers. You can get some intuition of the concept from the idea that if you had a normally-invalid infinite string like ""...99999"" and added 1 to it, the number would roll over to 0 like an odometer that ran out of digits, so you have identities like ...99999 = -1, ...99998 = -2, ...33333 = -1/3, and so on. Like with the real numbers, as long as you don't require the sequences of digits to eventually start repeating, the set of all these numbers is uncountable."	"For these ""small"" large numbers, the easiest way to compare them is often just to write them out as power towers. 3\^\^5 is 3\^(3\^(3\^(3\^3))), while a googolplex is 10\^(10\^(100)). Taller towers usually produce bigger numbers, so we might suspect already that 3\^\^5 is the bigger of the two. We can then use a series of equalities and inequalities, moving relatively easily from each to the next, to prove that this is in fact the case. Here's an example of how we might do it:

* 10\^(10\^(100))
* = 10\^(10\^(10\^2)) by replacing 100 with 10\^2
* &lt; 27\^(27\^(27\^3)) since 10 &lt; 27 and 2 &lt; 3, where I'm choosing 27 = 3\^3 since it will be easier to compare with a bunch of other 3s.
* = 27\^(27\^((3\^3)\^3))
* = 27\^(27\^(3\^9))
* = 27\^((3\^3)\^(3\^9))
* = 27\^(3\^(3\*3\^9))
* = 27\^(3\^(3\^10))
* = (3\^3)\^(3\^(3\^10))
* = 3\^(3\*3\^(3\^10))
* = 3\^(3\^(3\^10+1))
* &lt; 3\^(3\^(3\^27)), since 3\^10 + 1 &lt; 3\^27
* = 3\^(3\^(3\^(3\^3)))"	askscience	askscience	1

The agreement signed by the UNSC plus Germany stated two options(among many) in the event of dissolving the agreement. 

First option was for the US to state they are not in compliance and it would allow them to withdraw from the agreement without influencing the other signatories. 

The other option, that trump is using is to declare Iran not in compliance, which forces all countries to reinstate sanctions. This option requires no proof and simply requires the US President to say so. All countries that signed the agreement have to abide by it. 


Trump may be a idiot, but so too are our leaders who signed it with this option in it. "	"No they can't.

656	"&gt;Interesting that you think they're basically going to run the table on the rest of season. I think you did a good job on the write up in general, easy to read well formatted.


&gt;My overall question. What parts of the niners roster would you consider particularly sources of strength? Is there any group thats a top 5 position group in the NFL?

I think QB (small sample size),  ILB (Foster was ranked 4th overall as a rookie by PFF) and FB(lol) can maybe have an argument for Top 5 in the NFL.  However, I don't think you need to have a top 5 anything to go 10-6.

&gt;My personal thought is that they are incredibly likely to be 7-9, 8-8, 9-7 and miss the playoffs. I think that in general, the roster isn't strong enough yet to win it all. I think you probably need one more big off-season before it's time to make the push. Do you agree with that? Disagree?

We lost 5 games in a row last year by 3 points or less with a worse roster.  We know single score games are basically a 50/50 toss up in the NFL and tend to correct to the mean over time. If you flip all of those we go 11-5, even if you flip 2, that's 8-8.  We have a more favorable schedule this year, so I absolutely think 10-6 with a W/C birth is a possibility. 

I absolutely agree with you that if we were to make the playoffs, we wouldn't get very far.  We are still 1-2 years out from making a SB run for sure."	We will be relying on our super fast/athletic safeties (Tartt, Colbert) to help keep Evans contained. No DB can cover him 1 on 1.	nfl	nfl	1

However, Luke was also a physician, so the fact that he mentioned hematohidrosis (even if he didn't know what it was) would make sense. 

You do have a point though, and while it could be a mistranslation, it's hard to tell. What else do you think Luke could have meant?"	"Just like how Jesus sweat blood in the garden of Gethsemane.

Working out gives me a sense of accomplishment, especially when I find I'm able to do something I couldn't do before, like get into a tricky yoga pose or run an extra mile. 

Getting more toned has given me more confidence in my body, both due to how it looks and how much stronger I am now.

673	"From a kinesiologist Redditor: [Are squats bad for your knees?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2msj9z/are_squats_bad_for_your_knees_my_first_blog_as_a/)

&gt; Squatting all the way down is actually very good for your knees, whereas squatting only half way down is bad for your knees. Why is this? The first thing we need to look at is what makes a knee stable; the muscles surrounding it.

&gt; When you perform a half squat, you are working the quadriceps muscles (thigh muscles) to a great extent. This muscle pulls on the knee from the front. But a half squat greatly neglects the hamstrings and glutes (muscles on the back of the leg) which pull on the knee from the back. This causes problems in the knee due to the imbalance and instability created.

&gt; When you perform a full squat, not only are the quads worked to a great extent, but also the glutes and hamstrings, which provide a more balanced pull on the knee, creating more overall stability. 

A review of 164 scientific studies in the journal [Sports Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821469):

&gt; With the same load configuration as in the deep squat, half and quarter squat training with comparatively supra-maximal loads will favour degenerative changes in the knee joints and spinal joints in the long term. Provided that technique is learned accurately under expert supervision and with progressive training loads, the deep squat presents an effective training exercise for protection against injuries and strengthening of the lower extremity. Contrary to commonly voiced concern, deep squats do not contribute increased risk of injury to passive tissues.

Edit: This also addresses your question to u/2K_HOF_AI of ""If shear forces are bad, why is it dangerous to stop at 30°/60° but not at 90°?"" The short answer, as I understand it, is that *unbalanced* shear forces are worse than balanced ones. An analogy might be those steel cables that support [towers](http://lunarwind.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vestas_cabletower-825x510.jpg): each one puts significant but not excessive force on the tower, and together they help hold it up. If you cut the cables on one side, however, the remaining ones might pull the tower down.

If someone only ever half-squats, they'll be primarily building their anterior chain and its ability to produce anterior shear force on the knee. Combined with the higher weight that half-squatting allows, that unbalanced force will eventually start wearing on the joint. I'm not clear on how much of the damage is done during the exercise itself vs. walking around with unbalanced musculature. Posterior chain exercises such as deadlifts might be able to mitigate the second type of damage, although that's speculation on my part."

675	"Okay then here is an argument:



Group identity has always been paramount in society. All societies have operated this way, and it is not unique in any way to Marxism. Here in America—long before the teachings of Marx became prominent within our borders—society was heavily divided among ethnic and class lines. Down to as little as 1/8th of your ethnic ancestry. Similarly in places like India and the Middle East there were complicated ethnic-religious and class based caste systems. This is not at all a new development. Neither is the exploitation of these divisions, which has reared its head under literally every political and economic system.




The idea of Cultural Marxism seems nonsensical to me because of that simple fact. It’s more of a boogeyman than a real phenomenon. It takes something that already exists within society, slaps the word Marxism on it (because that’s a scary word), and is then used to disparage activist movements.



 This isn’t anything new by the way. To give an example, the US government attempted to used this exact tactic to derail the Civil Rights movement in the 1960’s. Stoke fears Communism. Label prominent Civil Rights leaders as agents of USSR. Direct public attention against them. It failed then and I expect it will fail now throughout the West."	"Well I think that a group of people with Regressive Traditionalist and potentially Authoritarian ideologies are burying those ideologies in “Conservative” and “anti-Marxist” agendas. Their tactics are scarily similar to those of Fascist Italy and Germany. These people are society’s enemies. Western society just hasn’t seen it yet.





Do you see how far out that sounds? And if I wanted to I could support and justify it exactly as easily and thoroughly as I’m sure you could justify your own assertion. 





Of course believing that different groups have differing views as to how society should best be run isn’t as *exciting* as believing in sweeping Fascist/Marxist conspiracies. But it is the simplest solution, and therefore the most likely. "	AskMen	AskMen	1

the bible suggests a firmament and water above it and below it. Since we have supposedly never been to space, we don't know that it is, in fact, air and not water

Photos of the other planets are all computer generated, even according to nasa. When independent researchers post photos of these planets using the most high tech gear they always look unclear and wavey, as if they're in water, 

And why is it really that we aren't allowed to the ""center"" of Antarctica? Maybe the edge of the world? Where one would find the firmament?

(Some even believe there is more past Antarctica. That all of our ""space exploration"" is actually just the government searching for more life on this giant sheet of ice. That we are just a hot spot on it and that there must be more)

And the science behind flat earth doesn't seem all that bad. I mean, we don't have many professionals working to figure it out so we can't compare its complexity to a round earth's science. And if God exists then one thing being round and another thing being flat makes perfect sense. 

Also, a lot of ""conspiracy theorists"" think that the media and government are trying to belittle us and make us feel dumb and small. They think this is done through fluoride, brainwashing/programming, etc... Would it be a stretch to think that they do this through basically telling us there is no God? (they tell us there is no God by making everything seem like it's rooted in science. The earth and evolution for example). This could be their plan since it is shown that less and less people believe in him. 

If we don't believe in God then we feel there is nothing miraculous about life and we all just submit to science and ""whatever the expert says""

I'm not assuming, all of these things are just as backed up as the moon landing or other theories.

If it was 20 minutes between blips of content for you, you were playing the game wrong. A majority of shrines are *much* longer than you're giving credit, as well (most take 10 minutes). Given that I've had several friends complete the game in 10 hours or less, your description of the game loop is inaccurate.

&gt; Spot on criticism if you ask me.

I agree with the title (that more might have been done with the Yiga), but little else in the article. As Skyward Sword was the low point in the series for me, and Zant being forgettable, trying to say ""copy/paste a mechanic from previous games"" just felt hallow. The reviewer also misses that the disparity between the Yiga as initially presented and how they are once you've seen their hideout is intentional. 

Most of this article could be summed up as ""I wasn't given a linear Zelda game."" At it's heart, this article just shows that BotW wasn't the reviewer's style of game, but on the whole, they miss the mark as to ""what's wrong."" As someone who prefers story and avoids exploration in a game, I think BotW did these aspects well (could have used some more modern Hyrule story, particularly with the Rito).

Now, that is more than enough for most rational human beings. We would advocate justice for his victims, and certainly wouldn't want our own kids around him. Once he is tried in court, we respect the ruling and applaud the legal system for rightfully protecting minority victims from a predator.

But there's one guy in the group (you in this case) who goes ""hold on everybody, we need to discuss how this guy is probably not really guilty, and is himself a victim of a liberal witch hunt by people frustrated with Trump. And while we're on the subject, let's talk about how touching kids wouldn't be so bad if we just didn't make such a big deal about it."" 

At this point, I look to the other people in the group and say, ""This guy either has such bad judgement that he can't recognize a self admitted predator, or he does recognize the situation and just dose not care - in which case, he has poor values. Regardless, he either has poor judgement or poor values, and we don't really need to waste time talking to him.""

You don't like that, say I'm calling you names, and then call the entire group prudes.

701	"Out on the open seas, they don't really need to change speed - they just cruise.  Near port, the tugboats take over and pull it in.  Makes sense to me that you could afford to make it direct-drive without making things too inconvenient.

Diesels put out quite a bit of torque, so stalling isn't as much of an issue at low RPM (With my old '91 Dodge Cummins, you could start it with the clutch engaged in first *or* second gear, and it would lurch forward and start running down the road with the throttle at idle).  Also, props don't engage statically with the water the way tires on a car do, thus further decreasing the need for a clutch or gearbox.

Then there's variable-pitch props (it doesn't sound like the driveline in question had them), which basically accomplishes what a gearbox and clutch would do.

Even if you could afford to build a gearbox that big (it would be expensive, and a major point of failure), shifting it would probably take about as long as shutting the engine down and starting it in reverse."	"Also, I think that sound dampening gives people a false sense of security.  They don't hear the road noise, or the engine, or the other vehicles on the road, and it lulls them (at least subconsciously) into believing they're safer.

I spent some time this weekend driving on the interstate in heavy rain, and I was astounded at the number of people who went screaming past me at 85mph when visibility was only 100ft.

I'm not a slow driver, but I don't fuck around with rain, snow, or poor visibility.  On a dry, sunny day with light traffic, I'm comfortable setting the cruise control at 85mph on the interstate - with a half-mile of visibility and good traction, I'm confident about being able to stop in time even if there's a stationary object on the roadway.  But if there's even a light sprinkling, I'm back down at the speed limit or lower, and doubling my follow distances (which are already generous).  Meanwhile, everyone around me thinks that the ABS and stability control can give them dry-pavement stopping power while hydroplaning.

I honestly believe it's a combination of things - the normalization of distracted driving, the lack of formal training, the lack of understanding of how friction and reaction time work, the false sense of security from improvements in safety - that have contributed to the decline of safe driving over the last 10 years.  When I started driving 16 years ago, the sight of a distracted driver weaving in their lane was fairly rare - I might see somebody doing this a few times a week.  Now, on just one leg of my daily commute, I see a half-dozen people who can't even stay in their lane because they're fucking around with their phone or their infotainment system.  Occasionally, I even see people *watching movies* while driving - one guy was holding his phone in landscape orientation in the middle of his steering wheel with a movie playing on it.  He couldn't maintain speed, and couldn't stay in his lane, but thought he was just fine driving on the highway like this."	WTF	WTF	1

Nobody, but NOBODY would want to live in a world without code reviews.  Imagine the Linux code base without the oversight of Linus and the rest of the community.  Etc.

Else why would organizations spend oodles of money on something that isn't usually even their core competency; i.e. software development.  Even a cursory review by a senior team member helps prevent issues.. issues like team members writing un-maintainable code.

I assert that anyone not in support of code reviews in organizations is either simply ignorant of the benefits and acting short-sightedly, or is perhaps just afraid their own code will not stand up to review.

&gt; proprietary probably gained a few of their former glory points back

That's not really possible.

If someone doesn't know the difference between open-source(broader category than libre(free as in freedom) software), then maybe they could think of it this way.

With open-source there is the possibility of user(or someone else on user's behalf) checking the software and building it(thus potentially ensuring the software isn't malicious). With proprietary there is no way to do that - you have to trust the provider of binaries, without any way of auditing them.

Of course, one might say ""but not everyone is a programmer"", and to add to that - even most  programmers won't check the source of each program they run. That's why the community is there - many other people can check it. Or if there isn't a community and the user needs the particular program - they can hire someone to maintain it.

A very big misconception is that ""free software must be free as in free beer"" ( which is the problem of the word ""free"", and why i use the term ""libre software""). The developer can without any ethical qualms sell the software they make, as long as the user also has full and uninhibited access to the source code. I read many times the reason why companies pay for software instead of using free(often better) alternatives - because they want to have someone who is responsible for the software to work. This is were I'd see the place for commercial(not proprietary, but libre and commercial: free as in speech without free as in beer) software: developer maintaining it and giving a warranty of the software's usability and stability and support. Note that at least vast majority of free software says ""no warranty at all, it might not even work at all"" in their license."

If you're ""pen friends"", then she thinks she's got some kind a relationship with you.  Even if she isn't attracted to you, she might care about you and would be hurt if you just stopped interacting with her and refused to answer when she reached out.  Ghosting her is hurtful if she cares, and rude even if she doesn't.  It should only be done to people who don't respect a decent request to stop contacting you...or who you never had any real contact with to begin with.  

I'm sorry you're afraid to explain yourself, but one way or another, it makes you the asshole.  She doesn't deserve to get hurt because you have feelings you don't want to express.  You're not even giving her the chance to make you happy!

I don't know if she is a racist or not but I do know this joke was inappropriate.  I also know that she accuses Trump of being a racist and of being inappropriate so that in itself should make this newsworthy.  She should at least be called out on it just like anyone else would.

715	"Hey lovelies! 

Imagine a steel chain, suspended with a weight attached on the end. Would the links further up have greater force acting on them as they would be holding up more links or would the 'equal and opposite' thing balance everything out.

And now imagine a chain drawn horizontally with a force applied to both ends - would gravity have a greater effect in the middle of the chain as there would be more leverage there if you see the chain as pivoting from the ends? And what if you had the same situation without gravity?

If there are different forces on different links could you strengthen those links and efficiently increase the overall strength of the chain? 

I look forward to hearing your thoughts. "	"Thank you. I guess the same questions could be applied to different sections of individual links. Could one manufacture chains with a direction, so each link is stronger at the point of greater force (the location of which could (?) depend on which direction the chain is being pulled)?. Anyway, I digress... 

I understand your answer if we imagine the chain is being pulled in one direction as this effectively creates a succession of forces with the 'forward' links bearing more weight (since they are carrying more links 'behind' them than other links further 'down' the chain), with the ultimate link having only the force of its own mass and friction acting upon it. 

E.g. Anchor point + three links (each 1kg in mass) + load (10kg in mass), all being dragged in direction of anchor point. We have four intersections between these five objects, experiencing ('forwards' to 'backwards') 13kg, 12kg,11kg, 10kg forces. (Right?). 

But now let's imagine a chain with equal forces applied in opposing directions (rather than dragging a load in one direction) - there are no leading or trailing links(?). 

E.g. 5kg force pulling 'left' + three links (1kg each) + 5kg force pulling right. We again have four intersections between the five objects. So do we have a force of 13kg acting on each intersection as each bears the cumulative mass and force of every other object in the system?

And what effect would gravity have - would gravity cause certain links to have more stress exerted upon them than others?

You'd obviously want the strongest people in a chain of people at the top holding on to the edge of the cliff above the shark infested waters, but where would you want the strongest if they were hand in hand spanning a ravine? My instincts say divided between the ones holding the ravine edges and the one in the middle, but maybe it wouldn't make a difference... "	askscience	askscience	1

&gt; He's just really intriguing, and he's the other reason I liked these episodes so much.

721	"Hmm. You had me stumped there for a minute. I like your analogy and you raise an interesting point. 

I guess if I were to carry on with your analogy, regardless of whether or not the guy who inspected the car was qualified, its not the consumers intent to buy a faulty car, nor is it their fault. And to take that a step further I suppose the manufacturer would owe it to the consumer to issue a recall and replace the faulty vehicle with one that is proper. 

Though I hand it to you my example of Spacey and Cosby aren't the best, but take the scientist one for instance. If an atheists scientist had done something to majorly discredit religion and went around giving scientific lectures, but it turned out they were molesting children would that discredit what they had said in their lectures (never mind the fact that the scientist uses logic and reason to formulate an argument and a religious person at best uses faith if not an utter rejection of reason)?

I also didn't mean to come across as so morally superior and high horsed so I too apologize. 

"	"Disclaimer: I'm not religious what so ever....

So if a priest is convicted of child molestation and it's proven, at that point I believe they would no longer be ordained. Meaning up until that point when the church condemns them they can give a blessing of any sort as an actual catholic priest. 

That being said if you're argument is that they lose their credibility the moment the act occurs (the act being molesting a child or some other heinous crime/sin), then I would in a sense also agree this is the case as it would be considered a sin I believe to molest a child, and therefore the priest would no longer be on a moral path to his god, but rather to some version of Hell. However the sin of the priest doesn't invalidate the beliefs of the people performing the Eucharist, and presumably the ritual was conducted the same way otherwise. So why would the Wafer and Wine be any less symbolic or meaningful to the believer who is otherwise unaware of the Priests misdeeds and themselves still presumably on a righteous path to their god? 

Following that logic is like saying a famous atheist scientist who made a startling and impactful discovery would have their work be invalidated if they were to later be found out to have mollested a child or any other crime of the sort. 

Or if you'd like another analogy, it would be like saying Bill Cosby's comedy or Kevin Spacey's acting were to no longer be considered good simply because of the disgusting criminal acts they were later exposed of.

P.S. When you insert matters of opinion like the ""brainwashed"" comment you left in parenthesis, you come across as a complete asshole and give non-religious people a bad name. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

There was this one girl in particular that always stuck out to me. We’d have to wear jeans all the time because, well, horses. I was usually in charge of all the miscellaneous stuff since we rarely had boys, and even then they were usually put into groups with the girls during the day. So I was only a counselor about half the time. 

So this particular week, it was ridiculously hot and we were down a counselor for the teen girls, so I was their counselor during lessons and whatnot during the day and then they’d join the younger girls and their counselor the rest of the time. 

Well, on Sunday,  it was hot that we all just wore shorts. We got out to the barn and started getting them on horses just to see how experienced they were. That was when I saw the cut marks on this girls legs and arms, quite a few of which looked no more than a few days old. 

So I talked to my boss and told her about it. She already knew. She also knew my history with the same problem and decided to put her in my group. The rest of the week went fantastic. She was really a great kid, but staff aren’t allowed to keep in contact with campers outside of camp (with some obvious exceptions). So after that week, I had no idea what happened to her.

I ran into her last year, 7 years after that summer. She’s still the same girl I remember, but so different at the same time. She said things got a whole lot worse after that week, but that week meant so much to her, and she later got the help she needed and went on to work at the same camp. I couldn’t be more proud of the lady she grew up to be.

Consider a human and a robot trying to get an apple from a tree. You might say that the robot would have to be programmed to raise its hand and pick the apple off the tree, whereas the human could consider its options and put together a course of action which would get it the apple (that course of action is likely going to be raising its hand and picking the apple off the tree). 

However, I think that is a simplistic view of what a robot can be programmed to do. Imagine instead of programming a robot to pick the apple off the tree, we program the robot to think more like a human would. Systematically (or maybe randomly, if we really want to mimic humans) go through its experiences, and either remembering an experience in which someone picked an apple and thus had an apple, or remembering an experience of grabbing an object and moving it to where you want it. Perhaps perform the calculations to predict the future (if I raise my hand to pick the apple, this will lead to me having an apple) or remembering intermediate steps (I remember that picking the apple requires me to first move my arm). 

It seems to me such programming would do what you say humans do, and not what you say robots do.

748	"BEST: Linkin Park (RIP Chester). My siblings and I saw them on their Carnivores tour with AFI and 30 Seconds to Mars. Linkin Park played last, so everyone as far as the eye could see was there to see LP. We were all screaming, singing along, acting like a bunch of weirdos, it was great. But when Chester did his 18 second scream in ""Given Up"" the entire place went silent and we all watched in awe as he fucking did it. It was powerful to watch.

WORST: The Agonist (metal band). They were my absolute favorite band when I saw them, and they did a great show. They were supposed to be touring with Eluveitie as openers for Epica, but unfortunately, Epica had to drop out for a few shows because the vocalist's dad nearly died of cancer or something. Anyways, The Agonist and Eluveitie ended up doing extended sets and really putting their all out on stage. To me, it was amazing. I got to see them perform some of their better, but lesser known songs, and I got to meet the whole band. I was having a blast with a few other people. But the rest of the crowd was pretty dead, bummed out because the headliner didn't show up I guess. I was headbanging to one of my favorite songs and this guy standing next to me looked annoyed AF. Like, dude, you're at a metal concert. If you don't like people headbanging next to you, go sit at the bar. So yeah, I had a great time by myself, but the atmosphere was the worst."	"Saaaaaaame...

754	I saw somewhere else in the thread associating Susan with discovering her sexuality, and I guess I can see the comparison. I think there probably  always has been some inherent sexism in the enforcement of those particular social mores, of sexuality outside of marriage, against women than men. That said, it's theoretically a sin for anyone, and I think Susan's plight is really more about sinners in general being apparently kept out of heaven -- the witholding of Narnia from a nonbeliever is a particularly apt metaphor here for Hell/Purgatory being no more, and no less, than the absence of Aslan aka Jesus in their life. 	 There's an interesting aspect of that, though: one guy, who worships this creature, is told that, while he formally worships the Devil-parallel, his actions and beliefs are so pure that he in fact worships Aslan without knowing it, and this is enough to get him into heaven in The Last Judgment (I think, going off years-ago memories).

778	There is no research on LISS vs. interval training in teaching running form or running economy. If there is please link it.	"I'm a fan of running faster and shorter intervals.

The most important part is not getting injured. Running slow tends to lead to a more passive running form (longer ground contact and more time to let the contralateral hip drop and the knee to move in). Also by going slower and longer you need to maintain a good posture for longer in a more fatiqued state.

I generally advice starting with around 5/10 x 30/60 seconds run at a fast and ""supple"" pace so that when you finish you could do an extra interval with good technique. First progress by adding more intervals, then do some longer intervals up to 2-5mins and then start building up one long run a week that increases in distance. At the start you can alternate the running with walking to get more time on your feet and help prepare for longer runs.

I recently ran a 50km and still do mostly  intervals with one or two long runs a week and a tempo run maybe once every two months. The benefits are less total stress because you do fewer miles, more technique training from the repetitions and still a great stimulus if you also do race specific training once a week."

So you're saying there would be no difference in tension across links in a horizontally loaded chain in gravity? I imagine that some links would experience greater stress than others - as in how a chain/rope/etc. under slack will dip in the middle and the fact that there is a difference in position across that object then one could infer that there would be different amounts of force experienced accross that object also.

Even if the opposing forces keep the chain from dipping, there would still be the gravitational force acting upon the chain and I posit that this force is experienced differently in a continuum between the ends and the centre of the chain?

And follow up question: would a rope act like a chain - could you have a vertical load bearing rope thicker at the top to offset the greater load there to efficiently increase load baring capacity (discounting more demanding production processes)? "	I understand that the equal and opposite reactions occur between each individual points of contact - i.e. between pairs of connecting links. Links 1 2 and 3 - there would be an equilibrium between links 1 and 2 and an equilibrium between links 2 and 3.

781	"It probably would have been better than ghosting honestly. Men always tell women to be more upfront, so I think it's fair to point out his lack of grace in backing out of their friendship. I don't think he was wrong not to communicate with her, but I think the lesson in empathy can go both ways. 

In this case, if the lesson is getting women to realize that men don't them friendship just like women don't owe men relationships, the flip side of that should be men realizing that it's important for them to be straightforward with women regarding their lack of interest in friendship. On an individual basis, I don't think it's necessarily wrong not to, but if men are going to criticize women for dancing around rejection, then I don't think they should be given a pass in situations where the roles are reversed. 

Other than that though, I agree with everything you said. 

Edit: Why the downvotes? I didn't even say the guy was wrong, just pointing out a potential double standard. I'm making a good faith effort to explain my perspective. I'm open to discussion, where do people disagree?"	"He bailed on the hike, but ""ghosted"" on the friendship. I'm using quotes because even though I know what phenomena I'm talking about, I'm suddenly very unsure if I've been using the right word to describe it this entire time. That said, in my experience, people generally don't appreciate it when people bail out or taper off friendships with no warning either. I've always been told that was inconsiderate and that the ideal response to not wanting to be around another person was being upfront and honest. 

It's unreasonable to actually expect ideal behavior from everyone all the time in practice, but we all have some idea what it's supposed to look like, so what's the harm in discussing whether or not that standard was met. That's what the gift of hindsight is for and for the most part, nobody hesitates to critique situations where women reject and/or disappoint men. It's happened in this thread a few times. 

People are willing to make excuses for the things this guy failed to do (ask about her relationship status, been upfront about his expectations instead of going silent, etc.) but not willing to do the same for OP who, at worst, didn't immediately see what was really going on. Once she did though, she acted in good faith, and I don't think she's been given enough credit for that. She could have bailed on him then but didn't. Instead, she chose to talk to him about it, and I think that was very mature. 

Actually, let's say that happened. OP realized that he thought this was a date, decided she didn't want to deal with potential drama, cancelled the hike, and then stopped talking to him without explanation. How does it compare to what actually happened? For instance, if what the guy did was a 3 on a 1-10 scale of general badness, what score would you give to someone who ended a relationship that way? 

If you think the score would be different, then I'd like to hear why since the only thing I can see that changed about the scenarios is who initiated the break in contact. Do you think she has an obligation to tell him that she ""figured it out"", or do you think bailing out or tapering off is really the ideal way to go about it? "	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	1

789	"You should know that couples therapy is very much *not* advised when one member of the couple is abusive.

It will just give her more tools to use against you.

You should consider going to therapy by yourself, so that you can work out why you’ve tolerated this for so long, and to figure out exactly how long you’re going to keep tolerating it."	"Put yourself in his shoes. You nabbed yourself a hot young thing, but you know deep down that he will soon outgrow you as he spreads his own wings.

What would you do to prevent that outcome?

You’d isolate him from his family, so they can’t tell him he could do better. You’d get him to drop his friends, so that he didn’t have anyone to talk to about you, to provide him with perspective. You’d make sure all of his time and attention is focused on you and *only* you.

You’d tear him down and belittle him, so that he wouldn’t have the self-confidence to leave you. You need him to believe that nobody else will love him, that he’ll fail on his own.

Most importantly, you’d have to make him dependent on you, so that he couldn’t start making his own money or meeting successful happy people at school or a workplace. Can’t have him thinking he can navigate life on his own, right?

This is a tried-and-true playbook for insecure, controlling partners. It’s how basically *all* abusive relationships start, and it’s because it *works* - for a while, at least.

Once you’ve experienced it, it’s a lot less likely it’ll work on you. That’s why people like him date so young; they need to find people who haven’t experienced this and are still ripe for manipulation.

Just because a Netflix Diablo animated series might be possible, doesn't invalidate Diablo 4 and many other potential/possible project announcements.
2. There is also the possibility of Diablo II: Remastered as revealed by Brian Sousa during our BlizzCon 2017 [**interview**](http://starcraft.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2017-starcraft-remastered-interview-brian-sousa). Watch the video at 20:50 where he talks about Warcraft II and Diablo II as next Remastered by the Classic Games team."

Nevalists: ""The forges here at Blizzard are burning hot, and we have multiple Diablo projects in the works, some might take longer than others, but we might have something to show you later this year.""

The title ""Future of Diablo"" tells me D2: Remastered is not much of a future. I think there is a new game coming. It might be an expansion, a new Class pack, or Diablo IV.

792	"&gt;But maybe also ask yourself why being married is so important for you if your relationship is happy and healthy.

Because for many people, stability, security, and commitment are necessary to happiness.

Aside from the insurance and inheritance issues you noted, marriage offers many other protections.

Your spouse automatically becomes your next of kin, giving them the right to see you in hospital and make medical decisions on your behalf. As much as I love my family, I know they won't be able to make the hard decisions, in accordance with my wishes, if I'm medically incapacitated.

This might seem like no big deal, but it's not unheard of for families to swoop in and exclude a common law partner in case of medical emergency. Even when they normally get along, the stress, fear, and emotional upset of having a loved one at death's door can make otherwise rational people react very poorly. Have a clear hierarchy of who is allowed to make decisions makes things much easier.

 Also, if one partner is giving up their career to raise kids or to follow the partner's career to be locations every few years, marriage offers certain protections if the relationship ends. 

If a house is in one person's name, but both partners pay for it, what happens in case of a separation? What if the person whose name is on the mortgage dies and their parents/kids/other family feel entitled to it?

These are only a very, very, few examples. But there are so many more, particularly when it comes to children, death, disability, and division of assets. 

Truth is, marriage is not particularly romantic in a butterflies-and-kisses kind of way.  Rather, it's pragmatic decision based in practically. But it also means that you can't just up and leave your partner with nothing if you get tired of them - which is, I suspect, who so many people are hesitant."	Then I guess you'd better just learn to love shitty sex for the rest of your life, because he's sure as hell not changing.	relationships	relationships	1

794	Justice is very different from revenge. Justice is (usually) morally acceptable because it prevents future immoral behavior through deterrence and containment, reformation or termination of bad actors who are likely to do bad things again. Revenge on the other hand is done as a retaliation. It's not done to prevent bad things from happening, it's done to make people feel emotionally sarisfied. And a lot of the time it can make things worse (especially if the bad actor learned their lesson).	"That makes no sense. 

If I have a mouse problem in my house, almost everyone would be fine with me setting lethal mouse traps. If they try to eat my food, they die. It's my house, and my food, and I need to eat, and mice are dumb and don't really matter. BUT, it would be *more* moral for me to set a no kill trap and release the mice in the field 5 blocks over. It'd take more time and effort, but overall I'm a *slightly* better person than somebody who just decided to kill the mice. 

Now pretend I'm omnipotent. I can just instantly whisk the mice away into a field someplace else instead of letting them get killed in my trap. If I don't, it doesn't matter *much*, since mice still are dumb and barely matter, but I'd be a better person if I did. 

If I want to be omnibenevolent, I always have to opt for the more moral choice. If God wants to get rid of the imperfections in his creation, he's omniscient, so he'd know not to create them in the first place, and he's omnipotent so he can easily fix them in a moral way. Instead, he just crudely kills people he's mad at. The whole ""firstborn son"" thing is morally deplorable considering he could easily gotten the Jews free another way. Instead he kills innocent children.

797	"I hardly think employers like the fact they are partially on the hook to provide healthcare. Employer plans started in the 70s when health insurance was cheap and was used as a perk to lure better talent. 40 years later, employers hate providing health insurance so much, in many cases they’d rather pay 2 part time workers than one full time which is much more expensive because turnover rate is higher, more HR etc. 

I agree with the rest though. "	"I agree with everything you said. I just don’t blame the employers. They can’t afford to eat much more of the costs. Big employers have tons of employees so eating more cost/employees erases profits and smaller employers just don’t have the funds to do that. I honestly believe they are doing the best they can to negotiate with insurance companies but insurance companies are coming back and saying this is what it costs. 

As for the cost shifting, we will always have that regardless the system unless we offer no protection and if you get sick you’re screwed which I think most people agree is generally not the best course. We do need a cultural shift health wise because you’re right, paying for a massive amount of preventable chronic illnesses would kill any healthcare system. 

Health insurance is a joke. It’s not a good system and probably never was. Covering Preexisting conditions goes against the ethos that is insurance and therefore has no place in healthcare. Single payer would be better but I’m with you when I don’t know the extent to how much better it would be.

800	"I dated a girl who moved to Williamsburg, and so I visited her there a few times before we broke things off. I learned there that normcore depends on context more than most styles.

At a bar or a coffee shop in Williamsburg, nearly everyone was dressed like a level 30 MFA'ers. These kids were pole\-axing whirlwind on Hell with two stones of Jordan.  All the OCBDs fit well. Everybody had slimmed cuffed selvage. Everybody had boots or white sneakers. All the t\-shirts looked good and interesting but not familiar. Undercuts were structured and lustrous but not shiny. And then some piece of drapy nebulous outerwear or a denim or leather jacket, and it was off to another $8 beer.

In that context, normcore is a noticed departure and rhetorical statement. It *is* a little bit interesting and thoughtful simply because in that context it's impossible to pretend ""Oh I just dress like this to be comfortable;"" wearing cargo shorts and a gap hoodie to Pete's Candy Store on a Thursday night is conspicuous and therefore inherently not comfortable. It's disingenuous to claim otherwise.

And I think that normcore is pretty rhetorically fascinating in that way. You couldn't dress normcore in Boston, for example, because that's just dressing like a Bostonian. But in the right environment, it seems like a fun way to explore expectation and fit and history, and I say more power to it. "	I maintain that ponyless PRL is some of the best value stuff out there.

Compared to a lot of travelling I've done, I thought I got good value and am now a lot less cynical about tours - I've been to some incredible places and learnt very little, but in Egypt there was always someone to answer questions and provide insight.

Nobody said anything about developers not having the ability to sell additional content. 

Game expansions has been in games for decades. They are not generally seen as exploitative unless they're obvious low effort material.

You can play any of the Souls games games online without the feeling that the developer is taking advantage of addicts to ""maintain"" a game's online service. All of the DLC in the Souls games has been well done original work that actually added to the experience without taking anything away for the base game. 

Overwatch 35+ million copies. Do you really think that it literally needs exploitative monetization practices to stay afloat? 

Rocket League was making tons of money before they let their greed take over. 

I don't understand why people keep framing it as ""poor developers can't make games without loot boxes"" when it clearly has never been the case. 

I mainly don't want my hobby to become a mess where every game is made around addict exploitation instead of quality and original gameplay.

815	"Thanks, but I'm really asking why do we lose the hearing to begin with, such as when standing up quickly or waking up.  Are you saying you think muscle spasms cause the hearing loss in these circumstances too?

I would think it would be the blood and oxygen level related, and if so, why does that have such a profound effect as to lose hearing? I don't really know of any other parts of our body that can be so effected by brief changes in blood oxygenation."	"I believe billbucket is wrong in his claim and his sources do not match up to his claims of what they say. See below.

Also, to not just show why the answer is wrong, I want to provide a better answer.

When you hear high-pitched ringing in your ears it is because your inner ear usually is not receiving the high level of oxygen it needs from your blood supply. The brain is not receiving a signal, and so it interprets this as ringing instead. When the oxygen returns to normal levels, your ear works again, the brain receives the signal, and the ringing goes away.

Why does this happen spontaneously? We've probably all experienced this upon standing up too quickly. The blood pressure drops and we hear ringing in our ears, as the ear doesn't receive enough oxygen briefly.

This same situation can happen spontaneously within the ear itself.  If there is an extremely minor interruption in the blood flow to even a tiny area of the ear, this will occur. This can happen just from a variance in your blood oxygen saturation (it constantly varies in our blood from 90-100% normally) or from a brief narrowing of a blood vessel from movement or vasoconstriction (which is also constantly occuring).

Combining these effects you can get a very brief and very tiny transient ischemia (low oxygenated tissue) that your brain will interpret as ringing but very quickly clears itself since it is so small and eventually equalizes.

&gt; The paper billbucket linked to clearly indicates the sounds perceived from the tensor tympani is not high pitched (and you can experience it yourself by closing your eyes very tightly, hear that roar in your ears?) and would not be related to what the OP is talking about. This is unsubstantiated conjecture that doesn't make basic sense or have any evidence.
&gt; 
&gt; billbucket's top comment in this thread is not the answer, and has no evidence backing it up. The other link billbucket used to support his theory doesn't even mention the tensor tympani and simply talks about the relationship between brief tinnitus and chronic tinnitus.

*Just do the current affairs question*. 

Current affairs is alive today. It's never a better time to read about it with Trump and the fake news and the awakening of the public. So what are the broad topics in current affairs?

- Arts &amp; Culture (film, music, tv, netflix)
- The Economy (income inequality, globalisation, consumerism)
- Nationalism (immigration, conscription, laws)
- Healthcare (Insurance, Subsidies)
- Housing (affordability)
- Media (biases), New Media (narcissism, censorship)
- The Environment (Paris accords, coal, renewable energy, waste in oceans, recycling)
- Business (Profits, ethics)
- Science &amp; Technology (cancer research, string theory, colonisation)
- Foreign affairs (wars, olympics, UN, diplomatic relationships)

If you're adventurous
- Law (criminal justice, law enforcement)
If you look at the past 3 years papers, there are at least a few current affairs questions:

*2017*

- Can the use of animals for scientific research ever be justified?
- To what extent are people judged more by their physical appearances than by their abilities?
- Assess the view that attempts to control climate change can never be truly effective.

*2016*

- Considering the money involved, should developing countries be allowed to host major sporting events?
- ‘Human need, rather than profit, should always be the main concern of scientific research.’ Discuss.
- Evaluate the claim that equality of opportunity for females is a desirable, but unrealistic, goal.

822	"Right now, [mortgage rates are still being held artificially low by the Federal Reserve](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/26/fed-leaves-interest-rate-unchanged-readies-markets-for-balance-sheet-changes/?utm_term=.87170a4c0b6a) as part of the recovery from the housing bubble. For about five years now, they keep talking about scaling back on this ""recovery"" effort, but they haven't done much. Wouldn't doing so help prevent many of these problems? 

I understand nobody wants to pay higher interest rates (I don't either), but when they are so low, doesn't it create a market for the wealthy (including foreign investors) to gobble up as much property as they can, thus over-inflating prices?"	"Agreed. The housing market crashed when we were just starting out. It was hard starting during the recession because no one was hiring. My husband had to do temp work with gaps between placements. I had a steady job at Starbucks, but I was a college graduate and couldn't find anything outside of customer service jobs that didn't require a degree. 

However, there was a lot of help with homes when we started out, too. They had a $10,000 home buyer's credit that you got if you bought a home and stayed in that home for at least 4 years. Prices were low, and interest rates were low. Actually, interest rates still are pretty low! Back when my parents were starting out, home interest rates were at 11%. Before the crash, rates were about 7%. The fact that you can get interest rates below 5% is still insane to me. 

Honestly, though, the way people are talking about homes reminds me of how people talked about homes before the bubble. Back then, in the early 2000s, everyone wanted to buy homes for investment properties. You can buy them and flip... that was the attitude at the time. The problem is, people bought homes, adjustable interest would go up, and they couldn't afford their homes. People stopped buying, and everyone went underwater in the homes they'd bought. I know a few people who literally had to declare bankruptcy over it, or were stuck in a starter home (like a condo) with an expanding family. 

So, I feel fortunate that we waited to buy until after the bubble burst. We bought a town home on short sale for a great deal, got a great rate, and got the $10k home buyer's credit. Now, home prices are going back up... which is great for current home owners, but not people who want to buy their first home."	news	news	1

831	Clearly people use the term that way, [but from what I've read that doesn't appear to be correct](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_bolt). A deadbolt is just a lock that uses a rotating mechanism without relying on a spring to hold the bolt in place. A deadbolt can accept a key on both sides (double cylinder), or only on one side with a simple twist knob on the other side (single cylinder). Do you have a picture of what you're calling a deadbolt? Is it just a twist knob inside and nothing outside? I guess that could still be considered a deadbolt since the mechanism of locking is still rotational... I dunno, I'm still confused.	Yeah, anything that isn't a deadbolt here is only for bedrooms and bathrooms, or screen doors. Why even bother putting a little crappy spring lock on an exterior door if it's got a proper deadbolt lock? I would literally never use it.	AdviceAnimals	AdviceAnimals	1

Conversely, sasuke had the ems and also a whole new dojutsu, the rinnegan which he JUST GOT, and therefore he couldn't use it with proficiency like say, nagato, so sasuke was still learning how to use the rinnegan, heck even kurama said that sasuke rinnegan was still new.
Now look, if he was able to trap all 9 tailed beasts into the chibaku tensei and recieve admiration even from kurama when he used sasanoo as a vessel, and went from simply shifting spaces between objects and the like to opening damn portals, imagine how proficient and much he has mastered everything and all the jutsu."	well naruto gathered a fuk ton natural energy and depleted any natural energy supply in the area there is.

"Just as an example, gold could be used instead of copper for a lot (more) of electronics and electric cables, since it's properties for e.g. conduction of electricity are much better.

The same is true for a lot of elements. Platinum (catalysator for tons of chemical reactions), rare earth elements (photovoltaics and electric motors/generators) and so on. Additionally, in the near future we will run out of a lot of stuff that is already unreplaceable in industry like helium, indium and rhenium. Keep in mind all the platinum we ever mined in history could fit into one big living room. Thats how scarce it is. All the gold ever mined would only fill 2 olympic swimming pools.

Rumble is very easy to punish, even when fed is utterly useless if the enemy team has a decent ADC/tank and has a hard time with waveclear early (versus tanks of all classes) due to the fact you don;t build much AP at all on him until super-late.

When Rumble was 'meta' nobody really complained about him, unless you were a severely underleveled, immobile ADC without flash and died to a well placed ult against terrain - Because there was nothing you could do. Yet champions that are easy to play, are untouchable when they're fed and have incredible earlygame winrates stay broken for fucking ages.

&gt; constant talking

Then has she mentioned OP to her boyfriend? Because I'm pretty sure not telling your SO that you're frequently talking to someone else of the opposite sex is not a sign of a healthy relationship. 

This girl has had two weeks to mention the guy; you'd think he would appear in conversation at some point in the first, say, three days. 

So lets say your plan pans out; OP stays friends with the girl, she breaks up with her boyfriend, and starts dating him. How long is it going to be before she meets some new guy that she feels a connection with, and talks to constantly without mentioning OP?

870	"One of the biggest thing that stuck out to me was the fact that the students in the lab of a supposed PhD program are buying their own equipment?  I have only completed my undergrad and am pursuing my masters, but in my experience, as well as everyone in this field I have ever encountered, all expenses relating to the lab and research are funded either by the school itself or through grants and private funding (such as Imagine buying the equipment). 
Another thing that seemed small but kind of made me chuckle was when they mentioned that an organic chemist would love to see what’s in the hot tub water.  It seemed more likely to me that a microbiologist would care, due to the numerous different bacteria likely present, or perhaps an oceanographer would care to look at metal concentrations or other pollutants. I honestly can’t think of a reason an organic chemist would know what to do with water from a hot tub. 
Another minor thing, which I understand was integral to the plot so I don’t mind too much, was when after looking at the sonar readings, Tory mentioned people were concerned and confused when a pod of sperm whales were heard in distress after diving and then never seen again. That seems fairly common, at least to my knowledge, since one of the main predators of sperm whales are giant squid, which they encounter when they are diving deep, so to have a group in distress and then disappear, would likely be written off as them having been killed by squid.

875	Friendly reminder that the existence of a single atom transistor made in a lab on it's own doesn't mean much for CPU manufacturing. The hard part is the ability to pattern it and reliably make billions of them right next to each other. Until one of the big semiconductor manufacturers (TSMC and Intel at this point) can do that, this won't really affect the tech world. 	"The issue is that it doesn't matter if you can make *one*. Nobody buys a single transistor. Of course it's possible to make increasingly small switches--that just proves that physics is continuing to work in the manner that we expect it to.

For instance, we've been making sub 10nm transistors for at least 15 years, but only recently have chips using 10nm transistors been possible to manufacture. 

Reliability is the most difficult and important part of manufacturing, because in order to get a part that does anything but sit there looking pretty, you need *billions* of transistors, and the overwhelming majority of them need to work. You need to be *certain* that when you pattern a wafer that contains what will hopefully turn into 500 processors, each of them containing a billion transistors, that you're not going to mess up any more than *maybe* a few dozen transistors across the whole wafer--otherwise the price of all of those other processors increases to the point where it's cheaper to buy several last-gen processors and get roughly the same performance."	science	science	1

This is a very interesting idea. You are suggesting that conservatives actually don't want to conserve anything: they want to progress.

I'm not sure I understand what makes this idea sensible. It's a little mysterious to me why we would pick the label ""conservatism"" for people who want progress. I would have chosen to label those people ""progressives."" I would save the label ""conservative"" for those who oppose progress, and then distinguish among progressives who think conflict is a precursor to progress and progressives who do not think conflict is a precursor to progress.

This to me seems like a more helpful division, because if we use words the way you suggest we use them, we either cannot describe people who oppose change and support tradition, or we have to call them ""conservatives,"" and that will be confusing, because then we'll have *some* conservatives who support change and some who oppose change and then it's not even clear what conservatism is.

Do you have any reason for thinking that a person whose view is something like ""I support progress, but I don't support progress without conflict, and I don't support regressive or totalitarian values"" should be labeled ""conservative"" rather than ""progressive?"" Certainly historically we have used the term ""progressive"" to describe people like this, like John Stuart Mill or Martin Luther King Jr., both of whom were extremely clear about supporting conflict and extremely clear about opposing regressive and totalitarian values. But you think we should label them ""conservatives?""

What about people who often oppose progress and instead support tradition and what we have been doing so far? Would you also call them ""conservatives,"" even though they don't believe that conflict is a precursor to progress (or more specifically, even though they offer their views not in order to cause conflict and then progress but in order to arrest progress)? Or would you call them something else? We have traditionally used the label ""conservative"" to describe people like this, like Edmund Burke and Roger Scruton. Would you call them conservatives, even though they advance their views not because they believe ""conflict is the precursor to progress"" but because they oppose progress?"	"Notice that my comment nowhere contained the words ""Republican"" or ""Democrat."" I'm talking about conservatives versus progressives, which are political ideologies, not Republicans vs. Democrats, which are political parties.

BOC raising rates to combat Vancouver and Toronto is like cutting open the whole body when only the hand needs surgery. The rest of Canada would be adversely affected because interest rates are federal not provincial. "	"With the recent announcement of more than $100-million in new tax reassessments it’s clear the federal government remains intensely interested in catching real estate flippers in Toronto and Vancouver. And some tax professionals and real estate insiders believe this is merely the beginning as the Canada Revenue Agency targets players in the property market who may have been cheating on their taxes for years.

“I know lots of guys – some of the things they’ve done I can’t believe,” says Jamie Johnston, broker of record for Re/Max Condos Plus Corp. in Toronto. “They measure risk and reward, and that’s why they cheat.”

It is extremely rare for Canadians to be convicted or sent to jail in tax evasion: for example there are about 29 million tax filings annually in Canada and there were 37 convictions between April, 2016 and March, 2017; that’s about 0.0001 per cent. It’s a little less rare in the United States, where the Internal Revenue Service that sees about 151 million filings a year and had 2,672 convictions in 2016 (0.001 per cent). “In Canada you never go to jail, so the rewards are high and the risks are small. I think there’s a systemic problem, a whole bunch of people are not paying,” Mr. Johnston says.

But in the past two years the CRA has been sending a different signal: We are paying attention and the monetary risks are real.

Last week, CRA issued a release that summarized its recent enforcement efforts. Since 2015, $592-million in additional taxes related to real estate have been discovered, in the most recent year alone another $102.6-million was reassessed and $19.2-million in penalties for false claims have been levied (since 2015 it has levied $43.7-million in penalties). The government is now reviewing about 10,000 real estate-related cases a year and it can take its time to find cheaters: it can review a filing for up to four years after it is submitted.

“While the Canada Revenue Agency has always had a presence in the real estate sector, we have increased the focus on the sector to address growing concerns of non-compliance,” says Jeremy Ghio, press secretary for the office of Minister of National Revenue, Diane Lebouthillier. “Over the last few years, the economic factors in the Greater Toronto Area and the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, such as high-valued markets combined with rapid price increases, have further increased the risk of tax non-compliance in the real estate sector. ”

In a previous era of lax enforcement, some condo and detached home flippers have been able to own multiple properties and sell them off without declaring all the eligible taxes. Now, many are discovering the CRA has some very powerful tools in its enforcement box. The CRA can follow land registry and other data sources, locate suspicious looking transactions that went unrecorded or under-reported on tax filings and then file a reassessment. If disputed, the CRA can compel developers, utilities, banks and telecom providers to hand over data about a home that is under suspicion.

“You’re guilty till your proven innocent; that’s how the CRA’s model works,” says Justin Kutyan, a partner and tax litigator with KPMG Law LLP, an arm of accountancy giant KPMG in Canada. “ Even in tax court, the onus is on taxpayers to disprove the Minister’s assumption of fact. Our tax system is based on a self-reporting system – it’s based upon honesty and integrity – and they have a lot of tools to double-check that you’re honest. It becomes difficult, especially when they have the objective evidence: you barely showed up to the condo ever, you never swiped your card, you don’t buy hydro, your mail’s not forwarded there, Rogers has you listed at another house.”

One area the CRA has turned its attention to is filers who improperly claimed a GST rebate for a new or substantially renovated home. Even though the maximum rebate is $24,000 it’s only eligible for a primary residence and falsifying this can be a clue of other activity.

“On GST, they are just crazy at CRA. They are going after it hard,” says Mr. Kutyan, who is a long-time tax litigator and who previously argued cases for the CRA before switching to the defence team with white-shoe law firm Osler, Hoskin and Harcourt LLP, and now KPMG. “I think those are creating leads on the income tax side.”

Take the example of Gideon Margolin, a real estate broker who recently lost an appeal on a GST case involving the 2012 purchase (and 2014 sale) of a new-construction house at 116 Riding Mountain Dr. in Richmond Hill, Ont. Mr. Margolin declined to comment on his case when reached by The Globe and Mail, but the court documents fill in some of the details. Justice Randall Bocock’s ruling at the Tax Court of Canada found Mr. Margolin and his spouse, “did not intend to occupy it as their primary residence … [and] neither of them actually used the … property as their primary place of residence.”

The Crown introduced into evidence readings from the gas and electricity meters that effectively showed little consumption of those utilities in the five months between when the house was completed by the builder and when Mr. Margolin sold it. Mr. Margolin had several properties that he shuttled between, but movers and his cleaning lady testified that he essentially used Mountain Drive as a storage locker.

He also did not disclose that he bought and sold another new-construction house in Vaughan, Ont. referred to as “Lynvest” in the ruling, until asked by the Crown lawyers during the trial. “The Lynvest property was closed only 45 days before the acquisition of [116 Riding Mountain] and Lynvest was sold mere days before [116 Riding Mountain] was acquired, all escaping Mr. Margolin’s initial recall,” Justice Bocock wrote. The ruling notes that those other houses are not part of this case, even though Mr. Margolin told the court he was seeking to avoid “trouble” on them.

During all this time, and to this day, it appears Mr. Margolin primarily lived in a $2-million house on an 11-acre lot in King City, Ont.

These $24,000 GST rebates seem like small potatoes for the government, but once proved, they become the thin edge of the wedge to pry open and reassess the tax status of those flipped properties.

Most homeowners are aware that if they sell a newly purchased primary residence within one year they might be subject to capital gains taxes on 50 per cent of any profit they make on the sale. But if the CRA finds that the owner to be a habitual flipper, who doesn’t live in the homes and that they are bought and sold as an occupation, they will assess those proceeds as business income and apply a tax rate to 100 per cent of the profits on any property. Not to mention, if tax filings are incorrect, the government can assign penalties – with interest compounded monthly – that back-date to the time of the original incorrect filing.

That’s why Mr. Kutyan is seeing a lot more home flippers coming to him for legal advice and representation.

“We’ve been successful for some of these flippers to somehow at least get the penalties dropped and at least get a capital gains treatment,” he says. His advice for flippers is to plan ahead and budget to pay your taxes. “What’s that saying? ‘Pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered?’”"	canada	canada	1

So then it's raid time last night. Down goes Fetid Devourer and damn it, I got the 355 helm. Well, better traits, so that replaced my m+ cache helm. Normal is over and we head into heroic. Fetid Devour dies and, well, wouldn't you know it, I got the fucking 370 version of the helm.

It was highly doubtful you'd even get 1 item per week. You might not get an upgrade for months. You couldn't even trade loot back then. The best gear was in raids and raids only.

What I'm saying, though, is that for me, I **preferred this system**. I like logging in for my raid nights, killing the bosses with my friends, and slowly but surely gearing up. Sure, I might not get all the best upgrades for months, but I preferred this set progression of gearing up. Also, small point, but worth saying: the not trading gear thing is completely irrelevant in a world of master looter with fair and proper loot distribution, which my guilds always were.

By the time you finish up with that tier, most people have all the gear they need and you move on to the next. By the final tier, everyone gets to start chasing their absolute BiS.

&gt; There's so many more chances to get loot it is insane

This where we're differing in our preferences on gear acquisition. I come from a mindset where I shouldn't need 12 hrs a day of game time to chase the gear I want. I like the idea of knowing, ""Hey, I run this raid because my BiS drops here."" So you run it every week, and hopefully eventually get it.

What we have now is a never-ending carrot on an extremely long stick. I don't like that I log in and know there's 20 different places I could be chasing gear at any given moment. Every second I spend fishing, or cooking, or creating flasks, or getting achievements is time I could be spending running +10s over and over and over."	wow	wow	1

937	"&gt; Do you know how many high school students apply to schools because the college has a good football team? 

I do know, and frankly it pisses me off, but thankfully that is very much the minority where I'm from (mostly uncompetitive sports teams + academically ambitious people).

I think we both agree that this discussion gets a lot simpler if you excise the football team or dramatically change its funding. It is possible to fully fund state schools with carve outs to prevent that funding from supporting non-academic things (and prohibiting student fees or donations from going to the football team, for example). The problem here is mostly political will."	"Funding, to some degree, controls quality. If top researchers and instructors are at no-frills schools because they're well funded and those schools cost the students nothing, only fools will go to other schools.

And if that's not enough, it should also be possible to ban certain types of well-defined non-education fluff from institutions of higher education. Even a private institution has to comply with the law and accrediting bodies (which, IMO, are not nearly strict enough about some things)."	Economics	Economics	1
938	"&gt; You give a lot of praise to the Nordic countries. So much so, that I wonder why a libertarian approach is the answer to these questions. A free flowing economy, with a democratic government providing a vast array of social services, paid by strong taxes. The system works. There are no looming dept ceilings or out of control corruption. The economy is strong and the people have high standards of living.

To start, I'm not a pure ""libertarian"" by any stretch of the imagination. I think the Nordic Model is a really good example of how I want libertarianism to look like. They have high taxes, but the tax structure is simpler and less prone to market distortions. Also, their welfare state is generous, but it's also better designed, and also features market-driven mechanisms. (Compared to the U.S. welfare system is a disaster of conflicting incentives.)

The Nordic countries aren't all perfect by any means, but it's pretty close to how I think of libertarianism. Strong economic (and social) freedoms, but a safety net that doesn't trap you there and lets you get back in the game. I wish people at LateStageCapitalism knew all of that.

&gt; The guys over at /r/LateStageCapitalism might be a bit dense, but literally nobody is asking for a communist regime. What they really want is some kind of safety, instead of living a life of dept and despair while the wealthy get richer and the poor get poorer.

I rarely go there, so I'm not too familiar with what gets said. I suspect you're probably right though. I'm guessing that most people there probably fall somewhere between Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn on the political spectrum. In other words, pretty far left, but they don't want to ""collectivize the grains and shoot the Kulaks.""

That being said, the stickied post at the top of every comment section is: *""PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THIS SUBREDDIT IS A SAFE SPACE FOR LEFTIST DISCUSSION. ANY LIBERALISM, CAPITALIST APOLOGIA, OR ATTEMPTS TO DEBATE SOCIALISM WILL BE MET WITH AN IMMEDIATE BAN.* That's followed recommendations for socialist literature (Marx, Engels, Lenin, etc.) and capped off with ""☭☭☭""

To an unapologetic capitalist like me, that's all pretty horrifying. I honestly don't know who all goes to that sub and what they believe, but they have ~25% more subscribers than r/libertarian. That doesn't make me too optimistic."	"**EDIT: I posted this comment [as a new text post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/832rn6/libertarian_thoughts_on_wealth_inequality_in/) just in case anyone wants to continue the discussion or add thoughts.**

To any LateStageCapitalism folks who might have stumbled over here, let me respond sincerely:

In every major civilization, from Ancient Mesopotamia to now, wealth has been concentrated in the hands of an elite few. Before you blame capitalism on all the woes in society, you have to show a time and place where that *hasn't* been the case. What economic system produces a *preferable* distribution of wealth?

It's certainly not any system based on Marx, Engles, Lenin, or any of the other ""intro"" socialist works your sub recommends. Regardless of how they labeled themselves (socialist, communist, ""People's Republics"", etc.), *every single country* that attempted to implement Marxist economic theory has had *horrendous* wealth inequality. High-ranking party members and their well-connected supporters lived **far** better lives than the average citizens. I can prove it: Name a single prominent, important Communist politician who starved to death during the *Holodomor* in Ukraine or the ""Great Leap Forward"" in China. Furthermore, Venezuela and North Korea are both experiencing severe food shortages, but they're both run by fat-fucks like [Nicolas Maduro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nicol%C3%A1s_Maduro_in_meeting_with_Iranian_President_Hassan_Rouhani_in_Saadabad_Palace.jpg) and [Kim Jong-Un](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kim_Jong-un_at_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea_main_building.png). I guess some are just more equal than others?

And before anyone plays the well-worn ""It wasn't real socialism"" card, I'd point out that they certainly thought it was at the time. Plus, if every time they try to implement it, they don't wind up implementing it, that seems like strong evidence that it doesn't work. ""Equality of Outcome"" is an impossible standard and should *not* be the goal of society. Every time it has been attempted, it has ended in catastrophe.

Now, you might point to the Nordic countries or some other places in Western Europe as example of preferable economies. I think there's a strong argument for that, and there are a lot of interesting discussions to be had there. However, you should still recognize that these are *capitalist* economies that all rank *very* highly on various indexes of economic freedom. There might be *less* inequality than the U.S., but it's nowhere near *zero*. There are still rich and poor, although the poor happen to be doing fairly well. That's in part because they have a fairly robust, well-designed safety net. You could argue about the benefits of their system, but make no mistake: these are very wealthy countries because of capitalism. It's because they allow individuals to control their own money/property and engage in voluntary exchanges of goods and services.

This also explains why wealth has *exploded* in formerly-Marxist countries after they liberalize the economy. *Billions* of people have been vaulted out of absolute poverty in the last few decades. If you want to have rising standards of living for the average citizens, you *must* have a market-based economy. The evidence is *overwhelming*.

**TL;DR** I know this is a long, stupid response to a flippant joke, but this shit is important. I understand why a lot of people feel angry and resentful towards the system. There are *real* economic and social problems with todays society. There is corruption, inefficiency, and just plain unfair all over the place. But these are serious, complicated problems and they require real effort to find solutions. But to solve them, you need to understand how we got to where we are now. Fantasizing about ""seizing the means of production"" and redistributing the worlds riches according to your obviously noble, enlightened principles is incredibly destructive and will get us nowhere."

The fact that you really, *really* struggle to live with dogs (as opposed to just being annoyed by them or something) does nothing to reduce the pain of losing their dog. You could have the best reasons on earth and it wouldn't change the fact that they lost their dog. It's nice that they can still see it sometimes, but having a dog at home is not the same as having occasional visitation rights for a dog. Pets also really help people with emotional support, which those girls probably needed during a time of transition like this. And regardless of who made the final decision, it was made as a direct result of you. You showed up in the house and the dog left. Of course they blame you.

Here's the thing: you're focusing on why nothing is your fault...when a mature adult would acknowledge how hard this must be on the girls. Their dad is dating someone the same age as his oldest daughter. A new person moved into their house very suddenly and is trying to parent them in a very authoritarian, infantilizing way. Plus, they had to give up their dog. This is a huge amount of transition for teenagers, who often struggle with self-regulation and who don't have much control over their lives. The fact that you didn't mean to negatively affect them doesn't make it any easier on them, and you need to own that. 

Your presence has created a lot of instability in their lives, but you expect them to magically be ok with that simply because you weren't trying to be an asshole? You're not mature enough to be the adult of the house. The girls can see that and they're not wrong. 
 
"	"You are correct: this is abuse. His behaviour is ramping up from 'red flag-y' to actual abuse...and it corresponds with you preparing to move in with him.

Do not move in with this man or continue to date him. Trust your gut. It is smart AF.

Edit to add: also, your self-care sounds very healthy and balanced. Don't lose that or let him shame you for it. A lot of people your age DO feel like they can't possibly do things like go home sick from work once or twice a year. They are really proud of themselves for being tough. I see the other side of things because I am a massage therapist. I get to help those people learn to take care of themselves when they finally crash and burn at 35. Your boyfriend is a gaslighting tool and it makes me angry, because the things he's trying to shame you for (being freaked out by his behaviour, communicating clearly and taking care of yourself by leaving work early) represent a really strong, healthy sense of self. He's trying to make you more vulnerable so that you're easier to control. For the love of god, do not let him! You are wise and assertive with a good head on your shoulders. He's threatened by that because he sucks. Don't give up even one tiny bit of your awesomeness to please him."	relationships	relationships	1

1. The reason for the scale (as you say 'billions of dollars worth of purchases' ) has little to do with planned obsolescence by MS and simply by the fact that they're the largest enterprise software supplier. In fact MS bends over backwards more than any large software company I know to support platforms as long as possible. Their commitment to backwards compatibility is second to none: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l60HHWWo9z4, you can update from a 32 year old OS straight to a modern one and they do their best to keep minimum requirements low for sales purposes. They have no incentive to make hardware obsolete, in fact they want the opposite. I think expecting a company to support a 20-year old consumer OS is unreasonable.

2. While you're spot on about the environmental impact of electronics it is such a tiny fraction compared to other human industries like transportation, agriculture, construction etc. If we could snap our fingers tomorrow and turn every car, boat and plane to solar powered then we could triple our electronics waste and the planet would be 1000x better off. I'm not saying it's not important, I'm just saying that if you're going to throw the label 'crimes against humanity' around then you should start at the top of the corporate evil chart.

Changing size and facing direction isn't movement. You're just lumping everything together because it involves a cursor.

There is more context than a surface level binary observation you seem to be stuck in."	"So you should use the steering wheel to change the volume on the radio?

1008	"I believe that the apparent contradictions come from overly simplistic readings of what the intent is.

Jesus makes it clear that the old covenant was *never* intended to be permanent. The fact that it is recorded in the Bible doesn't change that. When reading the Bible we need to be aware that it's *not* supposed to be that every sentence is God speaking directly to /u/windsofheaven. Instead it's a record of God's interactions with people throughout the ages. The fact that God says something to someone else does not necessarily mean he would say the same thing to you.

There are two things (that I can think of, anyway) that could account for different commands at different times, without God changing.

First, God is perfect, but people are not. The best way to lead an imperfect people may change as the people change. Jesus calls this out specifically when he says that Moses allowed the people to divorce because of the hardness of their hearts.

Second, the best actions to take can differ from situation to situation. I believe that this is the case with lending with interest, for example. The modern economic system is so different from the ancient one (norms around interest rates, the ability to leverage capital, etc.) that what was once a predatory practice can now be a kind and caring one.

1014	"No I disagree. 

Although it is out of fashion to say so, I think that peoples' relationship to work structures their place in the political universe to a much larger extent than we would like to admit. Therefore, some policies regarding peoples' relationship to work and to their employers (e.g. pay, benefits, holidays, job security, and working conditions), should suit nearly every working class person, regardless of who they are or what they do. If you are a ""23-year-old over-educated under-employed millennial"" and you work for wages, you have a lot in common with a ""45-year-old blue collar mill worker"" that does the same. These cultural issues are (in my mind) a complete smokescreen that are used to hide this fact.

So it is not a surprise to me that when the so-called ""progressive"" parties (including the NDP) have nearly entirely forgotten their roots as protectors of working people and small business owners, the small businesses have it tough and workers have it even tougher. Hopefully they will realize that large corporations, banks, bureaucracies, and other powerful institutions embrace socially liberal policies (e.g. gay rights) because it is easy, costs them nothing, and they can use it to pretend that they are on your side, when in reality it doesn't matter if the CEO buyer of your labour is a young, brown, gay person or an old white guy.

Edit: I also want to make it clear that I am 100% pro gay rights; my comparison above is between a party that imagines people as ""gay"" and ""straight"" as if it was a more fundamental distinction than ""worker"" or ""owner of capital"" (or even ""small business proprietor"" vs ""owner of capital""). This is what ""progressive"" parties need to understand."	"If you think that the political class wants to open constitutional negotiations over this issue, I don't know what to say.

1024	"There are actually legitimate reasons to ask behavioral questions, though there is some debate on the efficacy of either highly behavioral or highly technical interviews.

**EDIT**: My preferred method of interviewing is a bit of a conversation followed by pair programming on a small, but real defect we have, but it is very hard to get companies to let you do that and you really have to make sure you aren’t asking for too much time from the interviewer or the candidate and it only works if your hiring funnel has a very high rate of success filtering out quality candidates who are likely hires.

If you look at the wiki page for gun related self defense, it states “Estimates over the number of defensive gun uses vary wildly, depending on the study's definition of a defensive gun use, survey design, population, criteria, time-period studied, and other factors. Low-end estimates are in the range of 55,000 to 80,000 incidents per year, while high end estimates reach of 4.7 million per year”


Logically it would be somewhere in between, even if we say it’s still on the low end at 150k or 200k, that’s still more than gun related assaults, especially if you exclude suicide which make up an enormous portion of them, which most people agree should not be considered gun violence since someone jumping off a bridge isn’t considered bridge violence.

There is a difference between social policy and economic. What you are referring to is communism not socialism. You are correct in that no government or society in history has every achieved that. But a vast majority of the world is socialist in economic structure and political policy. Read more than Marx basically, his work doesn't exist in a vacuum and has far more applications than economics.

Socialism as a political movement was designed to combat the social issues caused by capitalism, so yes a lot of it is pro worker but in my view it's about blending capitalism in way that causes less damage, public resources needed for life such as healthcare and transport should be nationalised and owned by the public. 

Marx's definitions don't make over 100 years of progress disappear, socialism has as Marx intended has become political, just not in the way he predicted. Look at Freud, pioneer but progress has made a lot of his original work redundant, Marx's predictions did not come true and so they were adapted, economic capitalism did not progress to economic socialism in spite of the proletariat's best efforts or progress to communism. Political socialism sought to remedy that. It is a solution to a problem not oxymoronic it disagrees with Marx's predictions that makes it no less socialist. Again socialism is no longer defined by Marx in the same way Freud's theories are no longer defined by Freud. Socialism was not even defined purely by Marx when Marx was alive, what about Émile Durkheim, Max Weber or Friedrich Engels? Marx's work is not a bible, it is not the only view of economic socialism. If you ascribe ONLY to Marx fine but why assume everything else is wrong as opposed to a different interpretation or viewpoint of the same concept?"	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1
1043	That's very unlikely this summer, but not impossible. We expect to see nearly ice-free Arctic summers within the next couple of decades, but it could happen anytime between now and then. Lots of impacts when it does -- many not well understood. Effects on the marine ecosystem are likely to be huge, as all the ice-dependent species will struggle, lots more light will enter the ocean to provide energy for algae (bottom of the food chain), and species from sub-Arctic oceans will likely migrate in. Changes to ocean mixing and wind patterns are also expected. – Jennifer	"When I was a graduate student back in the early 90s, climate change was not talked about much. There wasn't even a formal class in my program. Not long after that, though, those of us studying the Arctic started to see some very peculiar things going on up there. In the early 2000s I attended a workshop that brought together Arctic researchers from many disciplines, and for the first time, the realization that the whole system was undergoing major, connected change slapped us up the side of the head. My research career took a hair-pin turn after that, and the rapid changes since then have only added to the awe and amazement.

In previous Zelda games your last possible save is always *before* the final boss, and the game has an actual ending that finishes everything. If you want to keep playing you have to go back to that save that's *before* the end of the game. Thus, you aren't really free-roaming post-game.

If BOTW lets you continue to wander around *after* you defeated the boss and you can't face him again because he's *actually dead*, then... yeah I could see that as being annoying.

1047	"I mean this is the list of top 10 paid RBs that are not on their rookie contracts: Devonta Freeman, Lesean McCoy, Jerick McKinnon, Lamar Miller, Duke Johnson, Giovani Bernard.

Only LeSean McCoy, Devonta Freeman, and Lamar Miller could be considered the ""workhorse"" of their team. Lamar Miller and LeSean McCoy have older contracts that were signed before the biggest increase in the salary cap and Devonta Freeman is basically in a 1A , 1B situation with Tevin Coleman.

So yes, I do believe that Leveon Bell is worth 50% more than those 3 RBs especially when you consider that his contract would be newer/more expensive then the others."	"He's not gonna be available at the middle of the season. Either way since he signed the franchise tag he's getting ~$1 million a game that he's on the roster for from the Steelers. There's no way the Steelers cut him since they would lose their comp pick and they would still have to pay him (fully guaranteed contract). You can't rescind the tag once he's signed it.

If you look at Overthecap for 2019 (when Bell hits FA) there are plenty of teams that will have the cap room for him.

https://overthecap.com/salary-cap-space

Only 6 teams wouldn't be able to eat more than $15 million in cap room next year and with signing bonuses being spread over the contract length you can easily get his first year cap hit under $10 million.

Also trying to predict team needs a year in advance is usually a fool's errand. What looks like a strength on a team can turn to shit pretty quickly in 1 season. With career-ending injuries for players a single play away for all of them you can't say what the RB FA market will look like next off-season.

Edit:
Also teams are relying on RBBC and young RBs because they have to not because they want to. It was way easier to draw up plays if your RB can do it all compared to have specializations and your offense becomes less predictable based on its personnel groupings. They're relying on young RBs because the FA market for running backs has been shit for the past 3-4 seasons. No good RBs are hitting the market and the majority of RBs have been busts. The past 2 draft classes have been chock full of talented RBs and they will get paid top dollar once they start hitting their second contracts unlike the shit classes before them. Teams want to be spending their high round picks on players that have a larger disparity between rookie salaries and veteran salaries. They would much rather spend their 1st rounders on QBs, EDGE, and OTs rather then RBs. "	nfl	nfl	1

1055	Paradis is a small island. Marley &amp; Friends only need to use some air support to roast Paradis into living hell. Paradis only have 1 zeppelin and 1 prototype fighter plane, and they have non-existent anti-aircraft system. This should've been an easy one for Marley until Paradis realized that even Titans can't attack something which fly too high.	"Yelena has been making some weird moves without paradis military consent, one of her moves that I'll be focused is her plea to spare Marleyan hostages. I found it rather odd since I really don't see her as kind person. Then I started to imagine what if Yelena is actually truly moving in the opposite interest of paradis military? This question leading me to a hypotheses that if it's true, then it'll create massive social media earthquake not only within SnK fandom.

So let's get to the point. Let's assume Yelena totally not support the military. Two questions comes to my mind: 1. Why Yelena spared Marleyan PoW?, and 2. Why don't she fully cooperate? My answer to question #1 is that she do it not out of kindness, but because she wanted to gather as many capable forces as possible to overthrow current government. So the remaining question is why she really want to get rid of them? Why, a person who have similar background with them, wants to backstab them?

After hours of reflecting, I've come to hypotheses. This hypotheses is sounds unlikely, but when I think more about it, the other puzzle started to fall easily into its place.

Here's my hypotheses: 

1. Zeke and Eren actually aimed to create a coalition with Marley, not to fight them to death.

2. Zeke and Eren will offer to Marley all the titan powers Eldian have + all of Eldian's military and technology might + obedience of Eldian to Marley under one condition : every eldian must have the same rights with their Marleyan counterpart.

3. Zeke and Eren will offer to Hizuru the rights to own ice burst stone mine in the island.

4. Zeke and Eren will force Marley to accept the condition with the rumbling threat.

5. Zeke and Eren will use coordinate power to make every Eldian convinced that they're actually Marleyan.

6. This way, Eldians will benefited from the safety Marley gave to them, Marley would benefited from every military resources they could have (including titan power), and Hizuru would benefited for the fact that they could mine those ice burst stone without fear of getting caught between Marley vs Eldia war.

This leads to a very interesting consequence if truly happened.

1. After acquiring such powerful forces. I think Marley definitely would take a shot to conquer more countries. Sorta like what germany did back in WW2.

2. People which support one side in the past suddenly support none of them. Mikasa, Gabi, Falco, Armin, and every Eldian and Marley who disagree with this direction will join forces with the rest of the world to defeat this ""Axis forces"".

3. Mikasa will stopped caring about Eren. In fact, she will loathe him intensely and wants to kill him. Armin won't see Eren as friend anymore, but an evil which must be killed.

4. Conny or Jean probably will be killed/brainwashed."	ShingekiNoKyojin	ShingekiNoKyojin	1

Sure, you could ""get better"", that's easy to say, but how? You need knowledge to improve, you need to learn from better people and, that's funny, but the balance will matter for them. 

If you look for a viable build, or you look on how better players counter a certain strategy, balance will matter in that case. Like, if you look how to defend a baneling bust, you need to find a valid answer for that. ""Get better"" and ""macro more"" is super abstract is not a valid answer to a specific problem. Which steps need to be accomplished to defend a baneling bust? What strategy I can try to imitate to practice and get better? In the case of a baneling bust, it's pretty well known strategy that is powerful, but where everybody has real advice on how to execute and defend, it feels balanced. 

When I play against an oracle that pops out at 2:55 the first time, I have no fucking idea what to do. So I ask around, I search around, I look at better players to see what they do. If I discover that even the pros themselves have no idea how to defend properly, then the balance also affects the lower players. The lack of valid and known strategies create a black hole where it feels hopeless and frustrating to play, hence the complaints about balance. 

If you want less balance complaints, you need to keep educating players and keep the knowledge flowing. The more the players think there is a solution to their problems, the less they feel the game is unbalanced. I think a player like PiG, who have incredible knowledge of the game, could act on that instead of dismissing balance discussions. People think that X thing is unbalanced? Counter it with knowledge, build orders, a gameplan and demonstrate it yourself how you do. Every balance complaint is an opportunity to teach, maybe not to the person complaining, but for the others seeing the complaint and wondering about the valid answer. "	starcraft	starcraft	1
1057	"I think what they are getting at is that digital downloads come with so little and almost virtually negligible marginal costs per download of individual unit, that ""leasing out"" (or even ""selling"" in case of drm free games) a large number of copies became a no brainer for reaching a vast userbase and making the most money. 

However things like home ownership are not quite the same model, because you cant host your design for a home and lease out practically infinite copies of the house to your customers ( **yet**, if you are optimistic).

In other words its the nature of the product (easy to make a copy of, on the server) and platform (lowering costs of internet data) (increased coverage of internet) that had facilitated the phasing out of ownership, and not some sort of change in our attitude towards ownership.

 For example, if internet were spotty or too expensive, or if the service itself is expensive or unavailable in my country, I'd obviously want to go back to a drm free ""ownership""."	"I've seen this exact phrase so many times. Can you explain what rent seeking means in this case? 

Because unlike the traditional use of the word ""rent-seeking""

* today you can choose to either own or rent a song. It differs from the rent seeking behavior of landlords with respect to availability of copies (unlike a landlord who owns the only copy of the piece of land he's sitting on).

* Also, land can only be rented to one person at a time, unlike music streaming (which can be sold or rented to multiple people at the same time). This sort of waters down the ""strangling"" aspect of it. They can still exert a strangle-hold by other means, like becoming a monopoly or really restrictive exclusivity contracts.

* Further more, land is a limited resource unlike music, and the landlord stakes exclusive claim to his portion of it. While with music, you can ""rent it"" on Spotify, google play, itunes, Windows store until recently. or regional third world alternatives. Some of these platforms even allow you to purchase copies (some of which are even drm free, but with traditional restrictions on distribution).

Given this obvious differences, it feels like your comment is almost a propagandist dogwhistle considering how many things it ignores and how it conflates literal and figurative (hardly, more like tangentially related) meanings of ""rent-seeking"".

Music streaming isnt any more ""rent seeking"" than, say a library's membership fee, or an author's royalty over his IP., Or an old fashioned record music sale that still restricts you from selling your own copy of it. It feels like the reality of ""the old days"" of music ownership is lost to nostalgia. You always only owned a license."	Economics	Economics	1

There is an app that demonstrates this on the iPhone called Cortex Cam.

1064	Those aren't very good examples, both are regulated by the government, and as a result of licensing restrictions, roads are safer than they would be otherwise, and thanks to FDA and USDA actions, foodborne illnesses as well as diseases caused by malnutrition have been reduced greatly. Remember [Trichinosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis#Legislation)?	"&gt;And unfortunately, I can certainly say that I would never trust any government, no matter its leadership or make-up, with that level of control over such an important issue.

You literally said you will never support gun control, because the government might take it too far; that's a slippery slope argument. If you can't even imagine a situation that you change your stance on, then you're not asking for a debate, you're asking to argue pointlessly. Fine.

What are you looking for me to say? That you're raising legitimate points? You are. Am I calling for a nationwide gun ban? No, because I'm not stupid. The US is obviously too large to adopt that method, and aside from that, no, the government shouldn't take everyone's guns. But the current system is not sustainable, and that price of freedom is too damn high. Which is why I am in favor of better gun control measures being worked out and discussed at both state and federal levels.

Specifically I'm in favor of making it more difficult to get a gun in the first place. That includes things like psychological screenings, which you've already addressed some legitimate points on. Banning all people with certain mental illnesses is no better than profiling, so it would need to be prevented, probably best by allowing an appeal/second opinion to be had, but that opens the door for messed up people to just see psychologist after psychologist until they get a green light, which is frankly too expensive for the common person, but not an abject impossibility. It's a pretty expensive loophole, but a loophole nonetheless. Honestly not sure how to fully prevent it. I guess I'll keep thinking.

Criminals being banned from legally obtaining weapons: convicted felons lose voting rights for 2 years after they are released. Maybe a similar system there? Voting is a fundamental right, just like the right to bear arms. Or maybe people just shouldn't commit crimes if they want to have all their rights? That's the exchange when they get sent to jail, so I'm pretty sure losing the right to a firearm is a reasonable punishment, for a variety of offenses. Not all of them, of course, but definitely a few. I can already hear ""but what about the wrongfully convicted"", well then we should also be calling for reform to the judicial system, but that's a different issue that isn't even remotely able to be addressed through gun control.

Criminals illegally obtaining guns/Usage of miscellaneous weapons: that's part of why controls need to be implemented - to prevent more guns from being out there to be obtained by illegal means. This is particularly important regarding gangs, like you said. And even if we can prevent the gangs from getting guns, what's to stop them from using a machete, or a baseball bat? But then again, everyday people commit murder with miscellaneous objects or even their bare hands. If a gang wants to hurt you, then a gang is probably going to hurt you. So gun control won't impact gang violence too much. But it does prevent OVERALL gun violence, which is the point; you can't just say it doesn't solve this one problem and therefore any and all benefits of policy are moot. 

As for implementing better training as you've suggested, that'll be great for anyone who owns a gun and happens to be at the scene when something does go wrong. It's a situation that's happened before and is a legitimate to defend as a possible resolution to catastrophes. In that same vein, though, there are plenty of times when having a gun doesn't/wouldn't help a victim. Like Las Vegas, where there was no way for any of those victims to retaliate against the shooter. To be clear, I'm not against required training since it should also help prevent accidents involving guns in addition to being a great addition to the situations I mentioned above, but it's not a preventative measure against intentional misuse of a firearm.

Also I want to bring up a few additional points you mention:

&gt;There is no fucking up with this. There is no ‘well, shit, sorry we didn’t see that one coming’ and just hoping the mass societal issue a policy could generate will be ‘solved over time’

So without gun control, hundreds and hundreds of civilian deaths are the price of freedom, but with gun control the possible policy flaws are unforgivable sins?

&gt;The purpose of having a representative government rather than a direct democracy is because we need to have thought-out, reasonable, objectively considered, and debated legislation.

Yet you don't trust those same representatives to maintain your rights once even minor restrictions are in place. 

&gt;Once this threshold is crossed, there won’t be any going back, government never cede that level of legal precedent when it comes to political control. 

You're simultaneously saying that confiscation and a nationwide ban are both impossible to implement and the only logical outcome. You also say that revolution is a point of great concern regarding the right to bear arms. It's what the second amendment was for, right? Then shouldn't you be revolting against the government if they do cross the line? It's the price of freedom.

&gt; So yes, it better be the best, most thought out policy there is, because this is a serious issue we cannot afford to misstep on.

Awesome, I'm not saying it shouldn't be thought out for a long time, hence my call for everyone to be part of the process instead of being like you and trying to prevent the process from happening at all. You're not helping."	news	news	1

Lift 1rms are

Bench 90 lbs
OHP 50 lbs

I have currently just started 5/3/1 for beginners and have finished two weeks. A concern I have is that in a program like 5x5, weight is added every session but with 5/3/1 it is every three weeks. So, considering my lifts are really low weight as of now is it better to switch to 5x5 or stick to 5/3/1 to get stronger and lift heavier? "	My question also is that, at this stage is it more beneficial to add weight every session or after a cycle? 	Fitness	Fitness	1

I was just tired of Christianity and the way they try to make you scared to try to force you to conform, so it was nice to see something where the characters realized they were going to die and had no real hope, but were still cool with it and had a great time. It was reassuring.	Personally, I think Fall 2017 might be one of my favorite seasons in a long time. It had two series I gave a 10 on MAL (Girls' Last Tour and Houseki no Kuni), whereas most seasons are lucky to have 1. And that's not to mention seriously good Romance in Net-Juu and Just Because, and a great series like Magus' bride. Second Season of 3-gatsu was great, and there were some surprisingly not bad series like Blend S and Imouto sae Ireba Ii. 	anime	anime	1

I have a goal, I told it only once to someone in real life and immediately regretted it. But I'm 100% dedicated to it. I want to look like Black Panther. I don't think it's unachievable in 2-3 years and to be frank I've seen progress pics where people look better than that. I can get there too, and if me after five months is making people uncomfortable, that means I'm on the right path and God damnit I'm going to carry on so when I sit down for BP2, Im built to the same level."	"Generally speaking your lifts from weakest to strongest are OHP } Chest Press } Squats } Deadlifts. 
So sure, it's fine to max out on your OHP. Try to keep pushing there though so you don't completely plateau. Lots of ways to do that like maybe more volume or a set of lower weights at the end or other shoulder accessory work. Important thing is to keep trying to progressively overload and not just be happy at a set weight."	Fitness	Fitness	1

One flaw in American politics that we've fixed in Maine, however, is our first\-past\-the\-post voting system. In 2016, Mainers passed ranked choice voting, and despite efforts by the state legislature to undo that reform, RCV is in place for Tuesday's primary. We are also holding a second referendum on the issue at the same time, and if RCV passes again, it'll be in place for the November election."	In a time of crisis, I would rather fight for what's right than be swayed by big moneyed electability arguments. The only way to beat this oligarchy is by creating real people power against a system that is trying to destroy the very fabric of our democratic society. If there is ever a time when we can win by doing it the right way, it's in this 2018 election.	IAmA	IAmA	1

However, it’s very concerning that you want him to apologize to “get her past this.” She sounds like she has serious mental health problems, and you guys should not be making decisions as a couple to try to placate her. It will never work.

The reason you should insist on an apology is that your mother’s struggles, as frustrating as they are, are no excuse whatsoever for your husband to act like an unhinged whackjob himself. You need him to be a normal stable human being, and a normal stable human being wouldn’t think that comment is justified to anybody.

I'd argue that the former isn't a job for Null Object. If a `null` is an error, then just error. Don't make an object that delays the error; if anything, throw an exception: If you got a null, fail because it's an error in usage. If you were going to return a null, then either it's 1 (in which case, either throw an exception or let the callee throw because you passed null to it), or 2, which is the proper reason to use a NO.

The contradiction is that his points still stand.  The Shinra Tensei 3 second gap clearly shows nobody is going faster than the speed of sound if they can't get to him in that time.  Your examples imply they do go faster.  So the manga is just inconsistent/contradictory.

In general, if you want to encourage people to engage and try to give their opinions and ideas it is not very helpful to embarrass them if you think what they said is dumb. Otherwise everyone else thinks ""I'm not sure about my idea? What if it's stupid, I'll get called out. I'd rather keep quiet."" 

Alternatively, you say ""that's an... interesting idea"" which conveys that it is not the kind of response they were looking for, or seriously considered, or that it was just kinda dumb. Sure, if it was obviously idiotic then everyone in the room might be thinking the same thing and secretly cringing, but you avoid using your power as the de facto leader in the room to discourage the minority who might actually think it IS a genuinely interesting idea from being chased off by social pressure from a majority.

So it's not just about politely telling someone to ""shut up."" (Though I'd have to know the tone to be sure.)

We often do say exactly what we mean, but only to close friends and relatives. In general, you can gauge trust and closeness in a relationship by how much ""beating around the bush"" you do with someone in conversation. 

Of course, if you've only ever spoken to a British person as a stranger or casual acquaintance you'd be forgiven for mistakenly believing we are never frank with one another, as the people you've spoken to were always being ""polite.""

The other thing is that if someone who you'd normally expect to be ""polite"" is, for some reason, being very direct and blunt, it's a pretty good indication that they're annoyed/angry/etc. and a general warning to try not to antagonise them further. "	videos	videos	1

Also it wouldn't make sense for Satan to pass through the earth in the form of man, given that Satan rejected man who was made in the image of God.

1149	"""Typical MTG Rules"" is a tough thing to get a grasp on, because there's so many different formats that people play. The closest thing to what you'd probably think of as YuGiOh Advanced would be ""Standard"" which is a format where only cards from the last 2 years of sets are legal. 

Commander (also called EDH or Elder Dragon Highlander) allows cards from any sets ever made, but is a multiplayer format that is kind of casual, with not a lot of tournament participation. That said, most serious Magic players also play Commander for fun and any store you go to will have Commander players and probably official Commander events. The Commander pre-built decks are probably one of the best values you can get in the game, but most of the cards you get in those will *not*  be Standard-Legal, so you kind of have to make a choice.

If you were to just throw all the other 'format' rules out the window and play kitchen-table-Magic, a 'Standard' deck will typically be more powerful than a commander deck for the money. But Modern or Legacy decks are even more powerful. There are budget options for every format. 

If you have a local store nearby where people play regularly (you can look online on the official Friday Night Magic website and look them up by zip code) then you should probably go there and see how the scene is - whether the play mostly standard, modern, commander, or draft format, and whether they have Leagues or any kind of new player program. "	I just want to say that you explain so many aspects of the format just in your explanations so succinctly that it's really impressive. Awesome article. 	magicTCG	magicTCG	1

1151	"&gt; You're pretty optimistic considering Microsoft did this exact same thing when they were ahead with the Xbox 360.

This is why I made my comment above. OG Xbox -&gt; 360 was a complete platform change, so was 360 -&gt; One. Now the Xbox One is the only platform that will get incremental console upgrades but retain the platform and current library of games (including BC games). They can't cop out and say ""well this technology (cross play) is not possible yet for this generation"" and stop supporting it, they literally have to go out of their way to disable it. Making already released games like Rocket League and Fortnite just stop supporting crossplay. That will be a PR nightmare.

Not to mention XBOX has transitioned from being Microsoft's ""console department"" to being Microsoft's gaming brand, aka PC is part of it. First party games like Gears 4 and Sea of Thieves support crossplay between PC, that would be like taking an entire 360 stance (no pun intended) on the situation."	"&gt; The only part that will never happen is MS outselling Sony again.

No one knows that

&gt; If Xbox One was more popular than PS4 then it would be Sony holding the fair play cards again, and you can say goodbye to all those PC ports of Xbox exclusives.

That's not what I'm saying... obviously if the tables were turned we would have seen a different game. Especially since Don Mattrick would have still been the head instead of Phil Spencer, who is actively the reason behind the shift of XBOX being less hardware and more about software (and thus we would have never seen ""Play Anywhere""). The comment was about *going forward* Microsoft dropping crossplay support. I don't see that happening."	Games	Games	1

1158	"I hear this a lot and it's just not true. Maybe the prices are similar for lenses built to the same optical and quality standards. But Fuji has no budget equivalent of a canon 50mm 1.8, 22mm F2, 40mm 2.8. These three combined cost the same as a single ""Fujicron"" lens. Nikon has a similar (and much better built) offering with the very good 35mm 1.8 and the 50mm 1.8. There are also affordable wide angle and tele zooms for both systems, plus even cheaper third party lenses. There is also a huge used market where you can get specialty stuff like a 300mm F4 for 500€

Paying 400-500€ for a single APS-C F2 prime is pretty steep, there is no way around that. The cheapest Fuji lens you can get (outside of the plasticky XC kit lenses) is the 27 2.8 and even that one is around 200€ used."	"Lightroom does have problems with demosaicing on Fuji's X-trans sensor (Fuji cameras with Bayer sensors like the original X100 or X-A Series are not affected). It's particularily noticeable with landscape shots that have foliage, grass, rock or other small details in them. The sharpening algorithm then creates wormy or painting-like artifacts in those fine details and it's a pain to get good sharpening. 

Rawtherapee, Darktable, Iridient developer, capture one pro (these are the ones I've tried) all work better out of the box in that regard.

If you still want to use lightroom and don't mind complicating your workflow a bit for a gain in image quality, you can purchase Iridient X-transformer, which converts RAF files to special DNG files that lightroom can handle much better.

 It basically does the demosaicing and some sharpening and then creates a DNG raw file that is much more similar to say a Canon or Nikon raw (Bayer instead of X-trans array)"	photography	photography	1

-called me fat/ugly/idiot/dumbass/bitch/pig dozens of times

-hes told me he hopes my dad dies (hes said this twice)
-hes told me my stretch marks are ugly
-hes made me get out of the car in a neighborhood where i didnt know where i was (hes done this twice, maybe three times i cant remember)
-he has a bad gambling problem that he finally just quit (although hes lost $30k to his addiction in the past year)
-he smokes weed every day (but gets angry if I want to have a few beers)
-my dog died I had her for 12 years, she died at my parents house last year it was a horrible time for me. I came back from seeing them on the greyhound, when he picked me up from the bus stop he yelled at me that i smelled like cigarettes (my parents are heavy smokers) it was such a hard trip for me having my dog pass away and all, but the first thing he does is yell at me that i smell like cigarettes instead of comfort me
-he has told me after we went to a rave (we got into an argument in the car after we left) he told me that the girls there had hotter bodies and asses than me

"I prefer the next step on that thought train back towards government having a legitimate purpose - The buzzword of the day is ""Classical Liberal"". You as a citizen, from the governments perspective, and be classified and considered, data pointed and tracked, in literally countless ways. And you ARE. But since those ways are in the millions, and as such functionally anonymous, we're basically okay with that.I hold the basic supposition that this is close to the right stopping point, but a stop or two off of Platonic Ideal - Which would be that the government acknowledges that a person can be classified a FUNCTIONALLY LIMITING number of ways - Trying to treat white people different than black people is a moral wrong. I'm not asking, that's a statement, to be clear - And it goes vice versa, and it works when you swap out ANY grouping into ANY slot there. Tune the details however you like - The verb portion here is the grand problem.Our government has demonstrated a repeated, moralistic, corruption oriented, religiously supported, racially driven history of atrocities. A large factor of cold war, prohibition, slavery, civil rights, and a dozen more EPOCHS of cultural events contain categories of atrocities written in blood with triple digits in broad body counts in dozens of event files. I get it. One hundred percent true.  
The knock on effect of this perspective is that.... Well.  The idea is that we are individuals, government is an inherently fucky process, and we should -only-at all times in the eyes of the law on every front available be treated equal in the most maximalist interpretation and structure/contexting possible. Equal under the eyes of the law, at all times, in all ways, including how we treat each other individually. This idea for a governmental kernel is so fundamental it functions as a personal philosiphy - Further knock on effect that produces spicy friction on the internet is that such a freedom oriented idea attracts people who have other reasons to firmly agree with one of the follow up principles this solid fact implies -  Identity politics is a moral failure of the grandest portion as such.

1215	"&gt;Interesting that you think they're basically going to run the table on the rest of season. I think you did a good job on the write up in general, easy to read well formatted.


&gt;My overall question. What parts of the niners roster would you consider particularly sources of strength? Is there any group thats a top 5 position group in the NFL?

I think QB (small sample size),  ILB (Foster was ranked 4th overall as a rookie by PFF) and FB(lol) can maybe have an argument for Top 5 in the NFL.  However, I don't think you need to have a top 5 anything to go 10-6.

&gt;My personal thought is that they are incredibly likely to be 7-9, 8-8, 9-7 and miss the playoffs. I think that in general, the roster isn't strong enough yet to win it all. I think you probably need one more big off-season before it's time to make the push. Do you agree with that? Disagree?

We lost 5 games in a row last year by 3 points or less with a worse roster.  We know single score games are basically a 50/50 toss up in the NFL and tend to correct to the mean over time. If you flip all of those we go 11-5, even if you flip 2, that's 8-8.  We have a more favorable schedule this year, so I absolutely think 10-6 with a W/C birth is a possibility. 

I absolutely agree with you that if we were to make the playoffs, we wouldn't get very far.  We are still 1-2 years out from making a SB run for sure."	Just out of curiosity, which positional groups do you think are weaker than they appear?  I would say our Interior O-line and pass rush are the only groups that would be considered weak.

Swaps happen mostly to more powerful engine versions that existed in the same model or their successors, as you stand a better chance of getting it registered.	Germany takes these inspections very seriously. The German TÜV or Hauptuntersuchung as it's actually called has been exported to several countries such as Turkey as a version with somewhat lower standards. It is bureaucratic and not perfect, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do: keep the highest amount of cars roadworthy, and to deter owners from driving cars on the road which are unsafe due to modifications or neglect.

1222	"Disagree. Seeking motivation presumes you have to *want to do something* in order for it to get done. With discipline you *just do because you give yourself no other choice* whether you want to or not. 

I think the association with discipline is very clear. It’s something you will do without wavering regardless of how uncomfortable or inconvenient it is. Motivation literally requires you to “be in the mood” in order to get something done. The mind set of a motivated person is simply different then the mindset of a disciplined person, even if they may get similar results in the short term. As I’ve said in other comments, motivation will inevitably fade as it the stimulus the causes the motivation experiences diminishing marginal returns. Discipline implies a mindset that doesn’t care about external stimuli, it cares only about the discipline, the task itself, and the commitment you made to complete it. 

All the rest is just semantics really, which I’m not keen on discussing. I believe motivation, and it’s connotation, became common parlance (specifically for the fitness industry, but applies elsewhere) because motivation is *easier to sell.* since it’s something everyone is always running out of. Once you force yourself to learn discipline once, you don’t really need to learn it again, and books titled “fuck your excuses, just make a list and get it all done” don’t exactly fly off the shelves. "	"I’m not arguing that with that at all. Just pointing out many people *without* any physical or psychological ailments fail to complete any sort of exercise for a lack of motivation.

Key ingredient to weight loss is diet, have you been disciplined at your food intake? Exercise only help that little bit, it's always no effect if you don't eat clean.

I exercise 6 days a week and no I did not lose much weight because I eat shit a lot. But anyway, rule of thumb: no processed food (like packaged food), replace white rice with better carbs (lower GI carbs) like sweet potatoes, some fruits, vegetables, lean meat, eggs etc. Snack nuts or fruits when hungry. And also cut down and don't purposely add salt into your food when not necessary. Too much salt causes water retention and make you looks rounder.

Also add weight training to your routine. It increases muscle and in turn, it helps you burn more calories. Muscle need energy. More muscle means higher energy burn.

And also __don't starve yourself__. It's bad for your insulin and it will cause more issue. That's why you heard they say body builders snack more than 3 meals a day (to 6 or 8?

They could have kids depending on them doing their job. And even if not, firing them could make them homeless - it’s not a proportionate response.


You often find people, even the people you think are arseholes, go to work with the best intentions. A lot of the time, rude people are rude because they’re not engaging with their filter as much because they have distractions in their home life. I’ve come across people who are fairly dislike because of their day to day manner and it’s because they have a sick kid, or their partners have terminal illnesses etc. Reminding yourself that these are people who are probably working through problems of their own makes things a bit easier to bear.

I mean, your comment was rude, should you lose your job over it if your employer happened to read Reddit?"	unitedkingdom	unitedkingdom	1

- Increase my strength (lifts) by at least 50% - so I start approaching intermediate levels.

""Homeless"" means you don't have a home to sleep in. You could be couch surfing, sleeping in your car, in a refuge or sleeping on the street (sleeping rough). You can be homeless without sleeping rough 

""Sleeping rough"" means you're sleeping on the streets. It's a subset of being homeless.

&gt;Being homeless doesn't always mean that someone is living on the streets.
A homeless person could be staying temporarily on a friend's sofa or living in temporary accommodation provided by a local charity or the council.

&gt;sleeping is a type of being homeless.
If someone is rough sleeping, this means they have absolutely nowhere to stay, so have to find themselves somewhere to sleep at night - often on the streets or in empty buildings."	australia	australia	1

You are looking for the Physical Sky and Earth and ignore all Spiritual Understanding. Physical Sky and Earth are not the True Earth and Sky they are just images of such. This is the Carnal (Physical) Mind at work and is the True Death.

Romans 8:6
6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

Wait you mean to be Physically Minded is Death, don't you have to die for death to be death?!?! Of course you are stating as such. You having been able to figure out what the True Death and True Life are. You think that you breath and walk physically therefor you must have Life. What rubbish.

What did Christ say?

John 6:63
63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

His words are Spirit, no longer when you see Lamb should you think of a Physical Lamb but the Spiritual Lamb! No longer think Light is Physical Light but Spiritual Light.

That said, pretty much the only interaction I've had with police in my adult life was a belligerant drunk white guy that demanded to drive home and fought an off-duty cop for his keys. 45 mins after the fight the cops showed up, the cops reasoned with him for more than **90 mins** and then finally arrested him. The whole ordeal took hours for a clearly guilty dude. (This seems excessive to me, I'm not suggesting the cops in Philly should have spent hours on this).

In this case the cops are calling for backup within 3 mins, if backup was sent at 4:45 it would have taken some time to arrive, and then pretty quickly they were en route. I wonder if backup was called to deescalate or simply for the logistics of arresting two men in a Starbucks? Either way only we're talking about 5 or 10 mins of discussion, max.

But from what I've seen in the video, and correct me if I'm wrong, they don't test the quality of the single parts like the display or the camera, the problem with OnePlus phones has never been with the build, it's been with the malfunction or failure of the display or the camera.

There's also the problem with software, every OnePlus phone since the first has had some kind of problem that was promised a software fix but most of the times they didn't deliver. 

Of course not everyone is affected by those problems, in fact my mother is still going strong with my old OPO, the only issues she has are with the sub par camera and slow charging (it probably doesn't help that she's lost the original charger).

All in all when I found out that they weren't an indipendent company I've always felt like I'd been tricked into buying a rebranded chinese phone marketed for a western audience (which is exactly what happened by the way, even though the OPO was an exceptionally good deal at the time), they've become shadier every year since then so they would need to prove me that they've changed before I consider buying another one of their phones."

I am sick to death of hearing how shameful it is to be white, and male.  It's not even acceptable, as evidenced by recent trolling to say ""it's ok to be white""...   I am also extremely sick of hearing that it's the evil guns, or the evil men that cause these atrocities such as the school shootings.  It simply isn't, it is people who are driven to the very edge of sanity, or were already on the fringe that commit these acts.  If you take a way the motive, a gun or a man becomes inert in respect to heinous acts.  Honestly, I rue the day that they actually win the gun debate.  Once that is not an efficient way to do damage, it will only be a matter of time before something even more lethal is used. Next it will be bombs, stop the bombs then what?  maybe bio or chemical attacks.  Crazy always finds a way, that's just a fact of life. Wonder if the Texas bomber had any access to guns.. maybe he went to the next rung already, because of lack of access.  To clarify, I am not saying leave the guns for crazies as a vent.

I don’t mind recommending counseling, and I believe that it can help, but it definitely won’t if he doesn’t respect her. Her saying, “It’s not okay with me to physically show you anger like that,” is an effort to set a boundary, and him saying, “Well, it’s your fault it happened in the first place,” is him steamrolling right over it before there’s even a situation where it’s needed. Not great."	"She *allows* her anxiety to stop her from doing things.

I get it. I’m super anxious, too. Every time I do anything with friends, I have to stop myself spending the next three hours analyzing everything I said and coming to the conclusion that I’m awful and awkward and shouldn’t be allowed out of the house. Sometimes, I have panic attacks. I have a super sensitive vasovagal response, which is a physiological thing that means that sometimes when my body feels threatened, I pass out (like when I felt slightly nervous on the first day of my new job, for example). I still go out with friends. I still have a yoga buddy and go every week, even if sometimes doing yoga in the room with the mirrors sends me panicking because of some flaw I see (I used to be in an amateur ballet company, and it’s hard for me to engage in physical activity like that without being really, really self-critical).

When we start feeling anxious and we avoid the thing that’s making us anxious, we’re teaching our bodies that we’re totally right to be afraid of that thing.

I don’t know if the judgmental thing is her depression, or just her being a jerk. Without more information, it sounds like she’s just sort of writing people off, which isn’t necessarily a symptom of depression. She can’t change her feelings, but she can change the actions she takes as a result, and frankly, she’s choosing the wrong ones. Use your “I feel” statements and tell her it makes you feel isolated and frustrated when you don’t feel like you can do the things you enjoy. *Let* her cry, because her behavior has been really shitty, and it’s okay to feel a little bad when you’ve been shitty."	relationship_advice	relationship_advice	1

How do any of the numbers that you listed have anything to do with how you compared 2 stock prices? The problem I had was with you comparing a stock price of $1800 to $190, which no one in financing would do.

&gt; The last is the most applicable for market cap valuation. As you can see, AAPL is 16X what AMZN is, but the share price is 1/10th.

You can't just look at one number and declare one stock is better than another. Yes amazon has a VERY VERY low or negative net profit margin, it has been that way for many years. You just repeated that Amazon has a low PE Ratio but didn't look into the reason why their PE ratio is so low. It is because they reinvest all their gross profits in to expansion.

Compare revenue growth and you can see where all of amazons profits have gone.

"It was in decline, but not because kerosene was superior. It had an established supply chain, just like gasoline does today, even though there are ""superior"" options. The Civil War brought whaling to a virtual halt. That was the beginning of the end of whale oil. The supply dried up, and kerosene began to make inroads on market share. That allowed it to develop a similar supply chain, so that it gradually out-competed whale oil over a period of time.

It's like gasoline and electric cars. Electric is better by most metrics. But it doesn't have the supply chain behind it. The country hasn't had to develop that supply chain because gasoline is still readily available. Whale oil didn't die a natural, competitive death because it was just worse than kerosene. It was sparked by the Civil War. And that's where it gets thorny regarding oil. Do we wait for alternative to just naturally prove their worth, or do we force oil out with taxes/etc?

1332	The advice given may have some truth to it but optimizing eating time with training time has very little impact. The most important part is how much calories you need and how much you eat. You would lose weight just doing that. It's more efficient to also work out but when eating is 80% working out is like 15% supplements is like 3% and when you eat is like 2%.(Those numbers are only examples for making the importance of each part clear). Remember you can eat in 15 seconds what you need and 1 hour of jogging for to burn. So eating less is most of the times easier than more training. 20 minutes of cardio seems very short to me but in combination with weightlifting is still better (for weightloss) than none.	"I know the struggle. Can you write out an example day? Maybe I can help you optimizing it for being not hungry and having a low calorie intake.

Some things from personal experience:

- Cardio makes me very hungry. When I do cardio for 1-2 hours I'm so hungry afterwards I'll eat more than I burned

- After cardio in my mind it's ok to eat more beause I did cardio that day even though in my daily intake cardio is already calculated for

- After weightlifting I'm motivated to eat less. In my mind the gains I got will look even better when I stick to my diet

- Eating more protein than other calories. Protein makes me more full and it's longer until I'm hungry again

- Eating vegetables that are mostly water based. (cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes) the calorie impact is very low and they help feeling full.

- Completly depended on what works for you but leaving out breakfast works for me.(kinda) I'm not very hungry in the morning so I only eat some fruits and the first real meal is at noon.

This is a good thing from our perspective as the last thing anyone else should want is for these two to combine forces.   The things that could push them together are also anathema (things like liberalization, progressivism, universalism, etc.) so they probably won't combine until it's a matter of survival.

It's an attempt to borrow credit without doing deserving it.  Like when you work hard at your business and your boss gets the bonus by claiming credit for it.  He is relying on his audience (his boss) not knowing any better, as is your mother.  Luckily, you can see through her BS.

Well good news: you can justify any position on any topic by quoting a bible verse.  It doesn't even have to have anything to do with the topic or position at hand; you just need to employ rampant speculation with a straight face.  If you need any ideas, look at biblical prophecy.

**Silkygirl**: their stuff actually isn't bad for their prices, though the brand is pretty much limited to this region so it's hard to know what you're getting into. I really like their Moisture Boost Lipcolor Balms.

Loreal's stuff is just alright; but other brands like Wet n Wild and Essence seem to be able to charge lower prices for products of the same quality.

Most classes are able to get to similar dps numbers and you always have at least 6 different professions in a 10man raid.

1356	You have to keep in mind they played in two different styles. Gwynn played in more of a small ball style.  Found gaps in the infield like no other.  Never hit below .300, with a high of .394 and never struck out more than 40 times in a season.  Edgar is great and belongs in the HOG but Gwynn was better in his style than Edgar was in his.         It's like comparing Ichiro and Papi. Two different styles make it tough to compare and it does come down to preference but I'd take Ichiro.  That said all of these guys are clear HOFers to me.

They do this because the residents don't want to see their community ""change.""

I guarantee that if those municipal regulations are lifted, a large fraction of the people living there would happily sell their home for above market value to a multi-story condo developer.

What about the fact that government regulations and neighborhoods with anti-development sentiments are a huge factor in the cost of building a house?

There are also a lot of major Chinese tech IPOs going on at the moment (IQ, HUYA, etc.) so speculation and volatility is hyper amplified the past month. Quite a few of these companies are subsidiaries of larger companies like Alibaba, so volatility carries over into those stocks as well.

Edit: Understand that something like $IQ (iQiyi) has been hailed as the ""Netflix of China"", with enormous subscriber numbers and a fraction of Netflix marketcap. As an IPO, it went from around $16 to $44 in about 6 weeks. Literally everybody piled on to buy it on the way up. And then it predictably crashed when people sold off their 300% returns.

“A child is not a Christian child, not a Muslim child, but a child of Christian parents or a child of Muslim parents...” - Richard Dawkins "	"You don’t just “flip the burden of proof argument” around. It’s an obligation, and your first sentence shows that you aren’t fully understanding what the burden is and means. Just think about it logically, can you actually prove that the purple invisible elephant doesn’t exist? Like seriously prove to me it doesn’t exist and isn’t floating above you right now...

To entertain your question here is my answer: There was never evidence to say god does exist. Why am I trying to disprove something to you that was never proved in the first place? How *can* you disprove something that was never proved? And no, I don’t think we would end up at the same place. I wouldn’t have anything to prove since I’m not making any claim? The religious person would begin trying to prove god’s existence through normal religious examples (miracles, complexity of life, etc.)

The burden of proof isn’t a cop out, it’s a method that’s used to determine if the claims a party has made can be backed up or proved. If people are going to make claims, then they need to be backed up and the burden of backing it up lies on the person making the claim. 

The issue, is that religion is so tied into our lives, that people are literally born with the belief that religion and gods are already accepted as “proven”.

1426	Yeah, laughing at anti vaxxers and encouraging people that those folks are morally deficient is just untrue and only serves to divide us more deeply. Education is key.	Are the parents a better choice though? At least a doctor can weigh risks vs benefits in a detached way. Children cannot consent to vaccines, there’s no way around it, and emotionallly charged parents who are mostly terrified and have their individual child’s wellbeing as their number one priority should not be making that call for the child either. Consulted and informed, yes, but the decision should rest with professionals who have access to the data on outcomes, contraindications etc. Parents don’t get a rule book on how to be parents, and some are better than others. We need to look at the greater good alongside the potential benefits to the individual child outweighing possible harms to said child. Parents have enough info to absorb and learn, we shouldnt require that they get a medical degree level knowledge about vaccinations too. Although I do think they should be taught about the potential for unvaccinated kids to carry, pass on and endanger children who cannot be vaccinated a lot more thoroughly. I’m sure it’s not something anyone wants to be responsible for, endangering an already compromised child by accident, possibly killing them even. I think that might help drive home the importance of vaccinating every kid who is able to be vaccinated. It needs to be less judgemental and combative too, as that attitude plays into the hands of the anti vax lobby. 	science	science	1

1434	"&gt;And that’s great. I’ve worked with lots of immigrants who were willing to learn, worked hard and integrated well while keeping their own values and culture alive, without being pushy or judgemental against ours. Sikhs are a primo example of the kind of immigrants we should be taking on board. Filipinos, koreans, japanese to name some others.

Well are you speaking about migrants or refugees? These are very different populations. If you're saying that economic migrants, which I take to mean migrants in general, don't integrate well because of a few incidences involving refugees then the argument doesn't follow. They are two distinct cohorts with different backgrounds and needs.

Refugees, specifically, need greater health support than other migrant groups due to the trauma experienced by these cohorts and, given their sheer lack of resources and potential ignorance of local culture, general capability to get started. For this reason good integration policy has to cover a whole range of areas, such as health, counselling, education, community engagement, employment, welfare etc. I've noticed many successful programs use former refugees - those that are now citizens - to get jobs assisting new arrivals. Fantastic idea since it provides jobs while also assisting others integrate in a forum that poses less obstacles, like language barriers or lack of personal experience with the process, and displays positive role models."	"The premise of your argument is flawed since there's plenty of areas that have successfully integrated refugee populations. Of course there are always going to be issues in some place, but this can be effectively addressed by simply implementing good integration policies. With Dutton savaging integration services, such as english lessons, income support, access to education/health/legal systems, things will get worse for sure, but this isn't a set outcome. 

Historically, we have had very good integration policies. Hence why we are recognised, and acknowledge ourselves as, a successful and proud multicultural country."	australia	australia	1

The children demonstrably did learn things as it states in the study, so an important question is how much do they learn vs other delivery methods.

If the study had specific information to convey to the test subjects and that information was delivered in different formats to different subjects then we would have an idea as to the efficacy of YouTube as an information delivery medium.

With a control group we may have discovered that YouTube had the same effect as other delivery methods in which case the headline would be 'YouTube just as useless as books for teaching toddlers' or maybe we would have found out YouTube is better for some things but worse for others.

Do we need a control? No. Is it a more useful experiment with one? Immeasurably."	science	science	1
1436	"The sources on immigrants committing less crime only ""associate""- meaning correlate- the rising number of immigrants in between 1990 and 2013 with lower rates of violent crime that also happened during that period. That decline can easily be explained by other factors, such as the transition from cash to credit (since robbing someone has a lower reward when a credit card can be flagged or canceled). Correlation is not causation.

Incarceration numbers are tough too, because if a crime committed by an immigrant is serious enough, he is deported instead of incarcerated, which is specifically stated as not counted in the CATO source. Therefore it makes sense that the incarceration levels for immigrants will be lower, for that reason alone.

I'm not suggesting that immigrants do commit more crimes than natives, since I don't have the evidence to bring (although illegal immigrants- or whatever you want to call them- are breaking the law by- usually- overstaying their visa). But overall, it is not cut and dry that immigrants lead to lower crime rates.

From the 1970s until the 1990s, women were the happier sex; now the opposite is the case, even accounting for other factors such as a [greater increase in incarceration rate for men over this time period](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States). If the rising income and wealth inequality from the Reagan-Thatcher era drives the rise in unhappiness, one would expect that happiness would change without respect to gender. Instead, men's happiness gradually increased while women's has gone down. It is clear that other factors are involved, possibly social factors outside of the realm of economics."

1439	"The libertarian point of view often points to Tokyo as the shining example of easy building, and incentivizing development. However I believe they essentially have rent control there, which is more widespread than San Francisco. Evictions are quite difficult, rent cannot be raised without the tenants consent, renewals are tricky to navigate which need 6-12 months notice to tenants, etc. But since almost everyone is under rent control the rents just don't go up, not incentivizing landlords to kick people out anyway. I think they have pushed past a critical mass of rent controlled units that actually keeps rents low for the vast majority of apartments. It's NOTHING like San Francisco Bay area, that's for sure.

Their re-zoning/redevelopment policy is always providing a glut of supply, it's not surprising rental yields stay low there (for such a populated metropolis), and rents stay pretty low. Good for many people, it's quite a renter culture over there. Im not sure of the details, but negative and near zero interest rates (hello deflation) and very low cost of money make this system work, from what I understand, to keep development going and going and going. 

I think more rent control in SF or CA is not going to work the way it's been done in the past , or in any of the proposals I've seen. I'm against it."	"Means tested rental help...section 8.

Did you read the study you linked? 

&gt;Conclusions. Despite recent marked reduction in mortality among gay men, Danish men and women in same-sex marriages still have mortality rates that exceed those of the general population. The excess mortality is restricted to the first few years after a marriage, presumably reflecting preexisting illness at the time of marriage. Although further study is needed, **the claims of drastically increased overall mortality in gay men and lesbians appear unjustified**."	"&gt;discredit 

Correlation does not equal causation. The author address this when they identify that the higher mortality rate is due to both subjects (in a lesbian relationship) being women and women overall have a higher mortality rate. The higher mortality rates has nothing to do with same-sex marriage and everything to due with gender. At most it should show that marriage with a women is more likely to end in death than two men marrying.  In any case, again, the author is not stating that same-sex marriage ends in a substantial increase in mortality. They show, in fact, that there is very little difference and more studies are required. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Making parents pay to reserve seats to sit with their kids is bullshit because it doesn't cost the airline (and therefore customers) a dime but making all seats have more legroom to accomodate tall people does cost us all money. I'd like to see more effort put in to certified-tall-people being given extra legroom seats that no one paid for but its usually not so much to just pay extra and very, very long flights already have more leg room. I fly transpacific more than I fly domestic and those all have generous legroom even for tall people.	"Gaia GPS. Strava Heatmap. AllTrails. Hiking Project. Maps.Me.

"	"So a few months ago anet introduced new rules to PvP to try and balance comps between teams more closely. On paper this sounded like a great idea to most of the community even though I was against it from the start. Why?  

Classes are not relegated to roles as with other PvP games.  

Take my last game.  

Our team comp consisted of a longbow power ranger, a burst power guardian and a holosmith.  
On the opposite and mirrored side they were bunker druid, firebrand support and scrapper support.  

As you can imagine the amount of sustain on their side was impossible to compete with or outdps in most fights. We were forced to rotate around them and all they needed to do was stall for time on 2 caps.  
It was a slow methodical loss despite the team trying their best to get around this impossibly tanky composition.  

The rule that made this possible is the same one that people were asking for for years. It was never a good and idea and unless each class is relegated to only a specific role it will never be a good idea. The randomness was better than we have now.  
Build diversity is in a good place. But the class mirroring is hurting that build diversity because running an offmeta build is even more painful than before even though the builds themselves are competitive.  

I would like to see this change reverted.  "	Guildwars2	Guildwars2	1

&gt;A solution in search of a problem  
  
[No, it is not, you're just too lazy or dishonest to make that very simple search.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Timeline_of_significant_events)  
  
Here is a brief timeline (an updated version of the FP list) of only some of those violations that made it to the headlines at the time and helped net neutrality advocates make their argument in favor of the stricter control over internet providers and to classify the internet as a utility.
    
* **2005** – North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked VoIP service Vonage.
  
* **2005** – Comcast blocked or severely delayed traffic using the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. (The company even had the guts to deny this for months until evidence was presented by the Associated Press.)
   
*   **2007** – AT&amp;T censored Pearl Jam because lead singer criticized President Bush.
    
* **2007 to 2009** – AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype because it didn’t like the competition. At the time, the carrier had exclusive rights to sell the iPhone and even then the net neutrality advocates were pushing the government to protect online consumers, over 5 years before these rules were actually passed.
 
*    **2009** – Google Voice app faced similar issues from ISPs, including AT&amp;T on iPhone.
  
*    **2010** – Windstream Communications, a DSL provider, started hijacking search results made using Google toolbar. It consistently redirected users to Windstream’s own search engine and results.
  
*    **2011** – MetroPCS, one of the top-five wireless carriers at the time, announced plans to block streaming services over its 4G network from everyone except YouTube.
  
*   **2011 to 2013** – AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon blocked Google Wallet in favor of Isis, a mobile payment system in which all three had shares. Verizon even asked Google to not include its payment app in its Nexus devices.
  
*    **2012** – AT&amp;T blocked FaceTime; again because the company didn’t like the competition.
  
*    **2012** – Verizon started blocking people from using tethering apps on their phones that enabled consumers to avoid the company’s $20 tethering fee.
  
*    **2014** – AT&amp;T announced a new “sponsored data” scheme, offering content creators a way to buy their way around the data caps that AT&amp;T imposes on its subscribers.
  
*    **2014** – Netflix started paying Verizon and Comcast to “improve streaming service for consumers.”
  
*    **2014** – T-Mobile was accused of using data caps to manipulate online competition.
  

In the absence of the current net neutrality rules, internet providers routinely used their powers to violate open internet principles, manipulate competition and even engage in censorship.  
  
Not mentioning, the shit-tier infrastructure, unfair market attributions, contractual monopolies, and general bullying of states/counties/cities by multi-billion corporations trying to protect their golden goose without working for it. But if you're the kind of consumer who likes being shat-on and pay for it you're in for a good time.

Temps are HIGH (68c), and very close to thermal limit (~72c) and would explain the 2.05Ghz boost (your CPU is running at half speed). Clean your computer and CPU heatsink and let the chip breathe. That will alleviate the CPU bottleneck you're experiencing. 

If gaming is your number one priority, dump your budget into a new GPU, and start saving for a platform upgrade (CPU, RAM, MOBO), while you can do this now with 600, your itsy bitsy GPU will show no noticeable improvement in games (and if it does, it will be improved frametimes, not more FPS)

I would not try and split your 600 budget between all your desired upgrade (CPU, GPU, RAM, MOBO) as you won't get anything worthy of a significant upgrade.

1497	"Microsoft doesn't necessarily need for those titles to go exclusive. There's nothing that states that their own titles have to only be for their platforms. Minecraft proves that they're willing to do this for certain titles and I'd think the EA Sports titles would fit that mold as well. They would likely give incentives to choose Xbox over PS4 though.

But if they did want those titles to be exclusive they would certainly be banking on the fact that those titles would drive consumer adoption and promotion under the Xbox brand. Microsoft is doing well almost everywhere else, they don't necessarily need the instant cash fallout from titles like FIFA and Madden were they to go full exclusive. For them it'd be about consumer awareness, and future loyalty. The Xbox One has already lost this generation to PS4. Nothing is changing that, but if you can say the next Xbox will have full exclusivity of some of these titles... wowee that's powerful for American and European buyers.

I think the first option is more likely, and the idea of Microsoft buying EA very unlikely, but I don't think it's insane, nonsensical, or impossible."	"&gt; For some reason I doubt that Microsoft was actually looking to acquire all of EA. That seems insane.

Why? There are bigger acquisitions happening all over right now. 

This would be the biggest purchase in the history of gaming (I believe) but outside of that context it's not all that different, especially in the tech industry. Even if we look at it in the context of other entertainment industry takeovers it's not the biggest (might not even be top 10 if you consider inflation). Hell Disney just bought Fox for $52 billion. If Microsoft acquired EA for $34 billion (its market capitalization) it would be a large acquisition but not all that insane for Microsoft really. Remember it attempted to buy Yahoo for $48 billion in the late 2000s. It bought LinkedIn for $28 billion a few years ago.

The timing could be right for Microsoft and EA as well. EA is getting a lot of bad press (nothing company dooming, but it hasn't been good for years now), but EA also has a lot of high profile IP and contracts to IP (Star Wars, FIFA, Madden). Investors might be willing to let go at this point given the continued bad press and potential hit to their games (I believe Battlefront 2 undersold?).

Anyway, I'm not saying at all that any of this will happen, I'm just saying it's more sane than it would have been 1-2 years ago."	Games	Games	1

1501	"I wanted to buy the currently offered set of unlimited harvesting tools for 2700 gems, but am hesitating right now.

The reasons/problems I have with it:

* Maybe it's just me, but I think the price is absurd, given the fact that you don't even get a full set for each character but have to swap it around manually or buy/use expensive shared inventory slots.
* Also regarding the price: You would get for example two seasons of the story for less gems.
* I get it, that it is mainly a convenience item but with charges of 50 respectively 100 the standard tools aren't out THAT fast and also don't use inventory space (except you bring spares of course)
* I am really struggling convincing myself to buy them mainly because of the high price. With the current ingame prices that would be nearly 35 Euros - the same I paid for PoF Deluxe.....

Just to make it clear: I played GW2 in 2012 and stopped. Just returned after several years, so I don't have much gold. Therefore I refer to buying this set with real money and not by exchanging gold for gems, like perhaps many ppl do.

I would be very interested in your thoughts regarding this, and perhaps I overlooked something but in the current state I don't think I will buy some of these tools. Instead I probably will indeed buy two seasons of the story - maybe a better investment?

Buck Allen had 150 carries last year compared to Collins' 212. Buck also doubled Collins' targets and even took some goal line work from Collins'. 

Dixon does have his injury issues but if healthy he can compete with the both of them for touches. He had a fairly decent rookie season but never burst onto the scene last year. He will get his chance to try and prove it again this year.

"Good question and I believe I have an answer for it, I’ll do my best but this isn’t a point I’ve heard anyone else bring up before. Before I’d like to say that the law the part of the Bible I talked about in my last comment didn’t refer to the law as in Ten Commandments and such, it rendered more to morality given by God.

Firstly he didn’t do it this way because that’s not what me created us for, he created us for him, to know him and be known by him. We are his children.

Second, more people will be saved this way I believe. The path to heaven without knowing about Jesus is more strict than the path through Jesus. That way you are still judged for your sins and must have payed for them all. Through Jesus though you are not judged for you sins, they are forgiven completely. Anyone can go to heaven through Jesus regardless of their past where as without him your soul must not be tarnished by evil. By accepting Jesus you also accept the Holy Spirit and it is the Holy Spirit that over time makes your soul perfect. The point of this so when heaven is created here on earth there will be no evil or pain or suffering like there is here now.

Also fun fact about the law (referring to Ten Commandments type law), that wasn’t given to us so we (people in general) could follow them and make it to heaven that way. That law was given to us to humble us and show us that we are sinners and we need to seek forgiveness from God, it was given to us to show us our need of a savior."	Christianity	Christianity	1

"&gt; it won't be the birth of the new House Hardyng of Vale, you'll simply have Harrold Arryn ascending to the lordship.

Correct, taking this into account makes it much more likely that all of these Houses remained in power for so long.

Here's one example in actual history where things happened differently. King Philip III of France (House Capet)'s second surviving son, Charles, became Count of Valois and formed the House of Valois. His own son, the future Philip VI, would become King of France in 1328 due to the succession crisis that caused the Hundred Years Wars.

When Philip VI took the throne, the House of Valois became the royal house, but Philip VI was simply Philip III's grandson through his son Charles. Had that happened in ASOIAF, the royal House would have remained House Capet.

Some places are worried that theyll get into trouble with a performer's management team if some outside entity manages to get a good photo of their talent. It also somewhat protects the talent from having shitty photos (some places legitimately tell the photo pit that theyre not allowed to photograph beyond the 3rd song (since the performer generally tends to get sweaty and grungier as the set goes on))."

"It seems extreme to you because you are looking at a situation through a lense of your life. If I stole $2 from you it may not be worth calling the cops over to you.

His life behind bars is nothing like that. Thats not just the smokes on the line but anything else he has. Op would either have to self isolate from other inmates for the rest of his bid or just plan on not having shit and other inmates taking all his shit and facing endless harrasment.

Try to look at it this way. Lets say I kicked in your door and bitch slapped you in front of all your friends, family, and coworkers. I punched your mom in the face and grabbed your wife and took her upstairs to fuck her. On the way up I tell you to have dinner ready when Im done fucking and to get rid of your dog.

1551	"I've actually considered that I may have ADD for some time now, after I read a post on here maybe around a year ago where someone's boyfriend was showing symptoms of ADD and I noticed I do a lot of the same (forget where I'm driving, end up at places I frequent just being on autopilot, loss of interest very rapidly in just about anything, can't stay on a hobby for more than months at a time, etc.). I never considered that that could have an effect on relationships. 

I may be emotionally immature, but I'd like to disagree that I'm egocentric, at least on the whole. I know she doesn't deserve to be led on, and I don't wish to do that to her. On the other hand, I don't wish to end the relationship, hurting her, and also risking the possibility of throwing away something good, for shortsighted solutions on impulses that may pass.

I'm not going to cheat, I'd like to make that clear. Like I said, I've been on both ends of that stick, and both ends are equally shitty. I'd end the relationship before resorting to infidelity.

Also, I don't know if it matters or not, but the ""homewrecker"" added me on a platform that did not require me to add her back. I wouldn't have accepted, solely on principle, if that were the case.

"&gt; Statistically the higher earner will pay alimony (if alimony is deemed appropriate, it isn’t always.) The higher earner is often the man, but I’ve definitely seen cases where the woman paid alimony to the man. 

Thus statistically a bad decision for men since they are disproportionately the higher earner. 

 &gt; Statistically the primary caregiver will retain more physical custody (despite 50/50 legal custody.) The primary caregiver receives child support. The primary caregiver is usually the woman, because she’s often the one who ends up leaving work or cutting back work hours to tend to the child(ren.) But if the father is the primary custodian, then the mother pays child support to him. 

Thus statistically a bad deal for men. In addition, men trade several things in exchange to cover for the lost income(time with their family,more hours, take a job they wouldn't want etc) for the income so it would still remain unfair to not get equal custody. 

&gt; If you’re afraid of statistics, then marry someone who makes equal or more money than you, don’t have kids or be the stay at home parent. 

That's not how it works is it? You'd want to be with someone you love rather than their income. Don't have kids is a sound advice for that of course, being the stay at home parent won't be an option for most men.

1559	"I feel like this is a bit of an impossible problem for them.

If the grind is fast it certainly lacks depth and falls into repetition of grinding levels. The d3 team did a lot of experimenting with design philosophy: classic reduced the level cap so it would be an achievable goal unlike in d3, and reversed this hard in the Paragon system.

Classic Inferno was like a more twisted version of d2s progression style, but much spikier and limiting, and the gear dropping incorrect mainstat is a much worse problem in d3 than in d3. So they reversed into Monster Power and the systems they're using now because people needed more grind but more gradual difficulty raises.

The old loot system was slow, but painfully random and frustrating. So it's much faster now, which makes it feel far more shower. New features like Ancients and Primals act as a band aid on this, extending the length of the grind but not making it more satisfying, just slower via increasingly random elements.

The dev team has mostly looked to those progression issues by relying on the random elements, but if it's too random I would argue it's even worse for being so arbitrary and unrewarding/ divorced from your effort and ability.

 I would say features like the Mystic were an excellent addition, if imperfect. The ability to gradually work towards cobsistent upgrades over a slower time frame is *so* important to that feeling of depth. Hopefully d4 retains more progression systems like this while making good use of its trademark style in random generation.

I hate rifts though and I want it replaced. The endless dungeon niche is incredibly important, but I miss playing *in the game world* like in d2. Too random areas like rifts that are inconsistent between floors disrupt all of the flow between locations and how it feels to dungeon crawl. I'm just crawling for the sake of it, and I lost the feeling of exploration."	"Old Inferno had its problems but what I miss most was being more invested in the maps. Of say, finding a dungeon in the world and exploring that. Original Inferno and d2 both had that feeling for me.

I think a lot of gameplay improved with the Rift system, but to me it just feels incredibly disconnected. Rifting made the story irrelevant, and the new difficulty system made rifts the only sense of progressing. Whereas say, graduating from act 1 inferno into act 2 was a cool feeling that isn't replicated in the same way.

Things aren't worse (in a lot of ways they're better), but some things are missing."	Diablo	Diablo	1

1566	"&gt; He wants us to split things 50/50

No. You don't pay 50% just because you're sharing the same lifestyle. That's not ""joint finances"", that's ""I'm cheap"". 

When there's any significant difference in income, the fairest way to do it is **proportional** payment of **combined household** bills. If he makes 80% of the income, he pays 80% of that combined total.

He should also be conscientious enough to pay for most of the dates if he makes a HUGE amount more than you, because obviously he's got more play money.

When you make more than you do now, you revisit the bills and pay a greater share. It's not rocket science. 

It shouldn't even make sense to HIM. If you can't afford 50/50, you're just going to ask him for money anyway, you know? And then it's not 50/50 anymore. 

Paying proportionally, you don't need to ask him for money, because you can afford your stuff and he can afford his stuff. 

In my marriage, we each have our own separate accounts, which the other has no access to, and we have a 3rd joint account, which we both have access to. We just transfer money into the joint account each month for bills. She makes 60% of the income, so she pays 60% of the bills.

But also, like telling a friend, the friend's opinion is based solely on the info and the tone given by your BF. 

If the point from your BF was to modify a story to get negative comments about you that he could then shove in your face, that says much more about your BF than anything.

My dad took me fishing as a kid, just like this, but we also always threw the fish back in. I see a lot of replies claiming it's ""because we didn't want to take it home"" or ""we didn't want to gut it"". But the thing is, while those were surely secondary reasons, the biggest reason was because I **didn't want to be complicit in killing an animal**

To a child like this, there isn't much difference between someone eating the fish you caught for fun, and someone killing the stray dog that followed you home from school. It's the same feeling of self blame that **I'm** the one that put the animal in the position.

The consequence of it all goes beyond spoiling their afternoon, because it very well may ward her off from fishing all together.

"I'm not trying to say at all that 100%, every single time you phrase a judgement how you did, it would turn out to not sound fully decisive. And I'm definitely not trying to say you're wrong.

""I think that guy's name is John.""

""That guy's name is John.""

Again, it would really come down to context, but in most cases, you're better off just stating your judgement as is- no need for the ""I think"". If you want to use ""I think"" in the explanation of your judgement, by all means. But if your goal here is to be as clear as possible, I would advise just being completely straightforward.

I remember in school, learning persuasive essays, I was taught never to use ""I think"" when stating my opinion. For the very reason that it just doesn't sound as confident and absolute as not saying it. You should always just state your opinion as fact and explain why it *is* fact. (In the context of this sub, please don't behave this way in a typical conversation. People will hate you)

Is it conceivable that anything could be constructed that could survive passing through the corona? It seems stuff must be whipping around like crazy in there, plus the insane temperatures. To my knowledge the highest known melting points are in the thousands of degrees, but I figure there is also some kind of blast force or something going on there.

*Edit* and if the corona is so easy, can you conceive of a spacecraft passing through the *photosphere* and surviving?

Not that it is possible with any known technology, but is it even physically conceivable that something could survive a close approach towards the surface of the sun? What would be necessary (special materials? some kind of super-magnet?)?

Thanks all for the entertaining and informative comments! I will let you all know when my machine is completed and ready for launch."	"One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.

Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess. You'll also have a higher brain/body ratio, so you get that cognition/ratio correlation."	askscience	askscience	1

1588	Honestly big government is progressive these days... so someone who says they are progressive helping to create the most intrusive intelligence system imaginable makes sense to me. 	Well, who is it that is responsible for essentially implementing, policing, and managing progressive ideals? (IE the safety net, management of policies policing the ideals in traditional progressivism). I’d say that answer is the government. Progressivism requires more government control in order to make sure those ideals are inacted. I would argue that government power in general is required, and can lead to that surveillance state to police those ideals. We have seen progressiveism lead to surveillance states in previous countries claiming to want to implement socialism. Anyway, it’s certainly not exclusive to progressivism. The establishment GOP would argue the same for national security and protection against terrorism. 	AdviceAnimals	AdviceAnimals	1
1589	"&gt; saying that your server is still 1.7 holds some kind of pride or something

No, actually. 1.7 just has very good hit detection, which is why so many PvP servers like to stick with it rather than use newer Mojang versions and simply add a plugin."	"Optifine is a mod. It modifies core game code; therefore, it is a mod. Simple as that.

Other client-side mods are absolutely not ""stuck back there""; PvP mods like 5zig and Better PvP are released with support for both older and newer Mojang versions. LabyMod is released only for older Mojang versions (1.7 and 1.8), and isn't being released for newer Mojang versions -- not because they are ""stuck back there,"" but because nobody's PvPing on the newer versions because they find the newer ones to be a lot better. On top of that, many players make custom client-side mods for specific PvP gamemodes that they maintain themselves.

There are few patches to old Mojang versions of Spigot and Paper because those releases have seen years' worth of patches. It's entirely believable that there simply aren't many bugs left to fix, and certainly no big ones.

Hypixel and Mineplex are not moving away from 1.8, and Badlion isn't moving away from 1.7. Those devs have embraced those platforms and are continuing to support them.

Development moves forward, yes, but what does ""forward"" mean exactly? Developers are continuing to build new experiences on top of a stable platform with features that players have come to expect, rather than garbage like parrots and llamas. In my view, the development on PvP servers has moved the Minecraft community forward. Just because said development isn't happening on the newest Mojang version doesn't make it backwards development.

""Development moves forward"" means that development should add features that make the game more interesting and enjoyable to individual players. If parrots are interesting and enjoyable to you, great; Mojang is moving development forward for you. But for players like me and for players like PvPers, Mojang is idle, and third parties are what really keep development moving forward. Just because it doesn't have a shiny Mojang 1.12 on it doesn't mean that it's moving backward."	Minecraft	Minecraft	1
1590	"I'm a 19F dating a 20M (almost 21). We've been together for a little over a year. We get along most of the time, but how I dress is a source of tension in our relationship.

In the summer, I typically wear sundresses or short-shorts and a t-shirt or tank top. He has no issue whatsoever with me showing my legs or shoulders.

However, he is adamantly against me wearing crop tops. He thinks that me exposing any of my midriff, even just a few inches of it, as a woman is inappropriate and inherently sexual. There is no way I can change his mind about this, even though I've provided some very reasonable arguments.

Like the fact that men can go around shirtless but for some reason women's stomachs are sexual... I don't get it. One of the most infuriating double standards.

One time, after we'd gone hiking, I changed my sweaty tank top to a crop top in the car. When he realized what I was wearing, he refused to go into the store with me dressed like that, and we ended up leaving.

It is this kind of behavior that I find concerning and frustrating. He doesn't try to control me in other areas of my life, but he is very stubborn in his ideas about female sexuality. He had a very conservative upbringing and hasn't yet thought for himself on everything.

Keep in mind that I hardly wear crop tops at all. I've only started buying some this summer because I'm finally becoming comfortable in my own skin and with my body. He can't understand that I don't dress this way for attention but because I now have self-confidence and self-love.

**In conclusion:** I'm torn between relinquishing wearing crop tops to appease him and ease this tension in our relationship and between standing my ground."	He has never banned me from wearing them. Just made his disapproval clear. We've kind of come to a compromise that I wear them, but not around him. 	relationship_advice	relationship_advice	1

It's fine that they give that option to developers, but that really doesn't have anything to do with the point that I'm making. I said that steam is the biggest DRM system on the market, and it is. 

Systems like steam exist and have existed under different companies for many years. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, GOG, Ubisoft, EA, etc. You don't have to imagine what steam would have looked like under EA or Ubisoft, because they already exist and most other systems that I've used were just as good, if not better than steam, which takes up like 2 gigs of hard drive space and requires 50 mb updates seemingly every time i open it. 

Don't get me wrong, like I said I like steam and I use it. I just get annoyed that people bend over backwards to ward off any negative thoughts about it or valve, but then will at the same time froth at the mouth over another company. People personify these businesses like they're professional wrestlers and it's just really obnoxious how people have these unfounded biases and think one company is god's gift to gaming, while another, that could be doing something better (like GoG) is either ignored or bashed because it's against their naive hive minded train of thinking.

 You know what I'm trying to say, and there is a distinguishable difference between a stem cell and a zygote. A zygote has a new and unique genetic makeup, while a stem cell is simply just another cell. It's like saying that a skin cell and a zygote are the same thing.

Folks are not encouraged to bring their children to meditation sessions or retreats.

Is there a pedophilia problem going on with Buddhist priests? I haven't heard of that. I do know that some prominent Zen teachers have been accused of sleeping with (adult) students, in particular Dainin Katagiri, who was my teacher's teacher.

1637	"First of all, I'm a dumbass for taking a women's word that I barely knew about being on birth control at face value. I was drunk and should've known better. I understand. It is extremely likely that I am the father (I came inside her twice). Plan B pill was ineffective based on ovulation day (I watched her take it and swallow it). Pushed for abortion but she's not going to do it. She's about 1 month pregnant so far. I am 100% willing to leave the country, but I've been researching the feasibility of this and passport revocation seems to be a major stumbling block. I've spent a lot of time thinking and researching this so I'll explain my train of thought below. I will ultimately accept the consequences of my stupidity, but I want to exhaust any options to avoid this if I can. In researching the realities of child support, I just don't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I see countless stories of men being financially raped, considering suicide, and suffering.

I'm 27 years old, just paid off my student loans (for a worthless degree), but haven't really made much more than $16/hr. This is why I'm worried. I won't have money for lawyers to get adequately represented in court, I won't be able to go back to school. and I'll be resigned to 19 years of destitution. Maybe its not as horrible as I'm making it out to be in my mind, but so far, anecdotal evidence points that way.

\-If I leave the country before any paternity affadavit is issued (if at all), I'm pretty sure I can still be served through my parents or some alternative service (I'll probably ask a lawyer about this). We're both residents of the state and this may be sufficient for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over me regardless of my absence. There are no long-arm statutes in my state that specifically reference child support or paternity. My hope is that by going to a country where there is no Hauge convention on service of process, the process would be costly, difficult, and she may not be able to. The target countries I would go to have no conventions on service of process.

\-If she serves me successfully while out of the country, its possible that through several proceedings a default judgement is arrived at. Once that is entered, and the arrears hit $2,500 my passport can be denied or revoked. I have not read anywhere explicitly that the government can revoke your passport while you're overseas, but that it can only deny an application for a new passport or for a renewal. I've talked to a few lawyers, the passport office, and nobody has a definitive answer on the scope the State Department's use of this privilege. I know they did it to Snowden but that's obviously an exceptional case.

\-If she can't serve me then I just stay out of the country for as long as I possibly can. The motivation and drive would be sufficient that I keep myself in compliance with the country's laws, visas, etc. I would also seek permanent residency and naturalization of citizenship through the country.

\-For the purposes of changing my name on my passport, I would still have the same social security number. This name change would be in public court records.

\-If I wanted to gain citizenship and a second passport in say, Paraguay, it may become apparent during the naturalization process that I owe child support or that my passport was revoked. Its hard to know for sure because there's little information on these matters.

If anyone has in-depth information about these circumstances, please let me know. Like I said, I will eventually acquiesce to the consequences of my stupidity, but I have one life to live and I want to enjoy it as much as possible. I can try to talk to a lawyer, but I doubt they'll be receptive to helping me evade child support. I simply value my freedom.

But I also know that doesn't count any console games, or Greenmangaming/3rd party bought keys, Humble Bundles, or WoW/FFXIV subscriptions. Ouch. "	"I think it had some incredibly good base systems. The physics based tools worked well, and they really nailed the sense of adventure by reading their players really well and rewarding ""I wonder if I can..."" kind of mentalities. Cooking was fun, trading was fun, weapons were visually cool, world interactions with your tools was fun, and it just overall had a really solid base.

Unfortunately they were missing any interesting dungeons, the weapon degradation mechanic was not well implemented, the overworld was visually bland in my opinion, and the enemy variety was sorely lacking. The plot was pretty much non-existent and what was there was kinda nonsensical. Combat was serviceable but ultimately didn't maintain interest through the length of the game. The way they designed the last boss fight was weird and unfun, almost punishing you with a weaker boss for doing well. Also the ""boss fights"" were underdesigned slugfests that didn't feel like Zelda bosses at all. With no dungeons, no interesting bosses, a very very small roster of enemies, and no mechanical tool discovery throughout the game..... it really missed the mark as a Zelda game. 

If I had my way, I'd have them cut the map-size down in half, layer it more like LttP was where everything is more tightly wound together and visually distinct, rework the weapon durability systems, cut the orb of power and korok seed puzzles down by at least half and funnel that manpower into making real Zelda style dungeons complete with tool unlocks. The story could be improved as well, though honestly that's not super high on the priority list.

As a sort-of writer I'd definitely go for that since romance not always being fair is a lot more interesting in stories like this, and I can definitely tell that the last few scenes don't really match up with what would make sense (Charles saying he wasn't all that keen on the engagement was a cop-out, you'd at least _sort_ of expect tada to be depressed about the turn out)

1655	"The costumes in the game are relevant to the levels where they are unlocked (such as a jungle explorer costume in the jungle level, or a chef's costume in the cooking level). So it makes plenty of sense for those to not be unlocked from the start, just like it makes a lot of sense not to show exactly what level cones next due to the game being structured like world exploration where you don't know where you're going next. *That* makes sense from the perspective of spoilers.

But let's not lose track of *this* discussion. What we're talking about here is random cosmetics. In most games that give out random cosmetics like this, many of them *are* available from the start, and I don't see people like you going around to say, ""Oh man, I wish the in-game store in Fortnite didn't spoil the fuckin' choice of pants I can unlock!""

The only difference between that and Mario is that Nintendo's PR department made a decision to unlock these cosmetics slowly in order to get mentions in the gaming press. But from the perspective of the gamer, I continue to insist that this is completely irrelevant and don't have a clue why you enjoy being manipulated like this while you wouldn't say a single word about games like Fortnite giving you everything up-front.

Are Mario's cosmetics different from another game's cosmetics? I'm sorry, but no, they aren't different. Are the **progression-driven** costume changes the same thing? No, they aren't -- and we are certainly not talking about those. We're talking about random end-game ""loot drops"". And you can't convince me that there is a ""spoiler"" there other than the spoiling of Nintendo PR's marketing event calendar."	"What makes it different? The cosmetics in question are not tied to gameplay, story, progression, or anything else. They are just end-game cosmetic loot that unlock on a timer. What is it the makes this a ""spoiler"" here that isn't a ""spoiler"" in any other game with similar end-game bonus cosmetics? "	Games	Games	1

1658	"Hey Reddit,

This summer, firefighters in California have been risking their lives battling the worst wildfire in the state’s history. And in the midst of this emergency, Verizon was [just caught](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/) throttling their Internet connections, endangering public safety just to make a few extra bucks.

This is incredibly dangerous, and shows why big Internet service providers can’t be trusted to control what we see and do online. This is exactly the kind of abuse we warned about when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality.

To push back, we’ve organized an open letter from first responders asking Congress to restore federal net neutrality rules and other key protections that were lost when the FCC voted to repeal the 2015 *Open Internet Order.* **[If you’re a first responder, please add your name here.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/first-responders-demand-real-net-neutrality-protections/)** 

In California, the state legislature is considering a state-level net neutrality bill known as Senate Bill 822 (SB822) that would restore strong protections. Ask your [assemblymembers to support SB822 using the tools here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/california/). California lawmakers are also holding a hearing [TODAY](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/08/23/california-state-assembly-plans-hearing-on-verizon-throttling-of-firefighters-data/) on Verizon’s throttling in the Select Committee on Natural Disaster Response, Recovery and Rebuilding.

We are firefighters, net neutrality experts and digital rights advocates here to answer your questions about net neutrality, so ask us anything! We'll be answering your questions from 10:30am PT till about 1:30pm PT.

Who we are:

* Adam Cosner (California Professional Firefighters) - /u/AdamCosner
* Laila Abdelaziz (Campaigner at Fight for the Future) - /u/labdel
* Ernesto Falcon (Legislative Counsel at Electronic Frontier Foundation) - /u/EFFfalcon

No matter where you live, head over to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) or call (202) 759-7766 to take action and tell your Representatives in Congress to support the net neutrality Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution, which if passed would overturn the repeal. The CRA resolution has already passed in the Senate. Now, we need 218 representatives to sign the discharge petition (177 have already [signed](http://clerk.house.gov/115/lrc/pd/petitions/DisPet0011.xml) it) to force a vote on the measure in the House where congressional leadership is blocking it from advancing.

UPDATE: So, why should this be considered a net neutrality issue? TL;DR: The repealed 2015 Open Internet Order could have prevented fiascos like what happened with Verizon's throttling of the Santa Clara County fire department. More info: [here](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/verizon-couldn-t-have-restricted-santa-clara-county-s-phone-ncna903531) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/verizons-throttling-fire-fighters-could-go-unpunished-because-fcc-repealed-open)."	The FCC's net neutrality repeal lets providers like Verizon engage in dangerous throttling like this without any fear of reprisal. With the 2015 *Open Internet Order* repealed, Internet users and public safety officials have nobody they can go to and complain about this. EFF just published a great piece on this [here.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/verizons-throttling-fire-fighters-could-go-unpunished-because-fcc-repealed-open)	IAmA	IAmA	1

1	Are you just here to rant? Between your comments on this post and your last one you seem to understand that your relationship isn’t healthy and he is not a good or supportive partner.  You had plenty of ppl telling you that on the last thread but all of your responses are like ‘oh yea guess what else he did!?’ With no real sustenance or action behind it..

4	"Well we know the spectral lines of Hydrogen, or the light equivalent of fingerprints of elements, as well as every other element on the periodic table. Galaxies are a big mush of these elements (although mostly H and He). Redshifting causes these spectral lines to shift to the left on the electromagnetic spectrum, or redshift, because if they were for some reason blue, they would be more red in color than what we know they truly are.

So we know where these spectral lines SHOULD be for elements that **aren't** moving away or towards from us, and we compare that to what we see in galaxies. A bit of math tells us how fast it's moving away from us"	"Finer and more detailed pictures. If I'm not mistaken, Hubble can only see about 10 billion light-years (ly) away, but those pictures are kinda fuzzy, we can still collect a lot of data, but JWST is going to take MUCH finer measurements, observations, and pictures.

 **Answer to your question starts here:** Hubble specializes in taking visible light observations, or pictures if you will, although it has tools to measure in other wavelengths, whereas  JWST is going to specialize in longer wavelengths like infrared due to the expansion of the universe redshifting wavelengths from so far away. This will allow us to see what the universe might've been like when it was just a wee baby and starting to create galaxies"	askscience	askscience	1

Step ups are a good one if they don't bother your knees for sure. You could try box squats once you feel comfortable to ease your way back into heavier lifting.

"You're right that the main lifts are the important ones to keep progressing. But who doesn't like progressing across the board?

Also, don’t suggest an open relationship if you’re not ready to deal with your partner exercising that privilege as well. 	I clicked on this because I was suspicious too.

You should be proud of your commitment and your progress, rather than being ashamed that you got there after two pregnancies and raising two babies.) Plus, her husband apparently addressed this very kindly and gently and hasn’t been shaming her and has been trying to build her up now that he knows how he made her feel. The other OP’s wife was, by his own admission, nowhere near overweight, in fairly healthy shape, and worked out regularly too. Plus, he was picking fights with her every 4-6 months because she wouldn’t adopt a strict enough diet to get “skinny.” These are two wildly different situations. 	relationships	relationships	1

How can Christians condemn these actions as barbaric or unjust when the Christian holy text proposes the same sorts of actions and judgements?"

24	"Locker isn't as good an athlete as Jackson and isn't an ideal build for a WR. Jackson is. He also wasn't considered too slight to play QB in the NFL which is a legitimate worry with Jackson. 

It's not a racial thing. people just don't respect his ability as a passer enough to not be intrigued by putting his athleticism to better use elsewhere. They think his skill set is better suited to a different position. This idea that people don't want him to play QB because he's black is weird and I don't really get where it comes from. Nobody tried to make Russel Wilson a slot receiver even though he's got the build and athleticism for it because he had more than enough talent at Qb to be sure thats where he belongs. It's a bit more hazy with Jackson"	" I'm sure there are some people who are quicker to think he should move because of the race thing but I think that probably a minority opinion even among those who think he should change position. I think its mostly how obvious the connection in body type and athleticism is with another position. Theres also a reasonable assumption that some of that athleticism would be wasted at qb in the NFL when he cant be half the offense as a runner.

I don't really understand the people who don't want to see if he can develop as a qb first but I guess they're mostly making note of obvious similarities between him and other guys who have already either flamed out or transitioned to receiver . 

Personally I see him as the same kind of prospect as Josh Allen, high ceiling and super low floor,but with a backup plan if it doesn't work out.

 Every book must have protagonists, because nobody will care  if some random new character saves the world, it has to be someone you care  about, someone you saw growing throughout the series.

This characters also have to go trough adverseties to the story, not only to grow but to create tension in the middle part of the story and make it interesting. Jon's dead, but thats a common trope in stories he also died in probably the best place in the whole Essos to die, near his wolf (who happens to be called ghost) a red priest and near a bunch of undeads. Dany regains, in some extent, contol of Drogon by the end of the ADWD, Jaime might get killed by Stoneheart, but I doubt Brienne would allow that.

All this five characters were main players when GRRM outlined the series, a lot has changed ( 3 books became 7), but the endof the books is omething that he already had in mind.

27	"Got my barb to 70 and kitted out with various sets and after running a few GR60s with Raekor variations I can't figure out why Boulder Toss is the preferred spender and why cube slots are more used towards boosting Furious Charge.

Most builds I see run Standoff + Vile Wards in cube so your FC is your primary damage, but that was my slowest run by far with roughly 6:30 left on the clock.

Then I went for a build more focused around Boulder Toss, slotting both Three Hundreth Spear and Skular's Salvation. It was a bit faster, finishing with 7:45 ish left on the clock.

Lastly I went with Fury of the Vanished Peak and Bracers of Destruction, using the Rumble rune on Seismic Slam. I dropped my time down a ton, close to 10 minutes left on the GR timer.

Furthermore if I look at the math we have the following:

*FC: 500% of Movement Speed * 40% via sprrint + 20% via WotB so 300%ish boost, (assuming speeds are additive which I'm not sure of) and then vile ward which is # of enemies dependent.*

*BT: 60% + 250% (against 5 or fewer) so 310% total boosts.*

*Rumble: 500% + 500% to the first 5 enemies so 1000% potential boosts.*

Numbers line up with my experience, but my experience doesn't line up with the leaderboards. So why are most folks near the top running Standoff/Boulder Toss?"

We used echo sounder sonar which was a shallow &amp; deep water sonar while entering and leaving harbour. This would sometimes be used to test the depth of water for “hands to bathe” or where the water might be unchartered or risky. Hands to Bathe is when the ship stops in the sea and us “Matelots” (RN slang for sailor) go for a swim.

A server is just one machine, it has limited capacity and is extremely vulnerable to hardware failure and power outages. The modern large company, like Facebook, puts thousands of servers in a data center building somewhere, then makes multiple of these buildings for even more power and security. There's absolutely no way the OASIS runs on one server, and in fact it would need so many data centers because it's apparently like several times the size of Google.

To put it in perspective, if your Grandma used a website hosting service to create a home page for her cat, that home page will be likely be automatically deployed across several servers for reliability. If your Grandma needs multiple servers, the OASIS absolutely needs way more than that."	MovieDetails	MovieDetails	1

I was comparing two men who have massive influence on our way of life who are on different ends of the spectrum and why preventing political donations of capital wouldn't have nearly the effect people expect it would. You then attacked me because you think the right attacks Soros more than the left attacks Murdoch. After I reiterated the meat of my argument--which incidentally had direct implications on the manner in which you are conducting this argument-- and you presumably read it, you've decided to broaden this even further by talking in umbrella terms about which is worse, effectively doubling down on ground that I have already asserted is toxic and part of the problem.
"	"Bottom line is this brings out the hypocrisy in both sides. When men like Rupert Murdoch wield their financial and public might he gets pounded by the left and center, when Soros does something similar it's the rights turn to shout and point.

You're never going to take the private wealth out of politics, and if you did then you're still left with the immense and in my view more important issue of partisan media bias. What do you think a politician would prefer? An implied endorsement 3 times a day on a media station which is watched by millions of people or a  6 figure donation to be used to pay for adverts which will do the same job a fraction as effectively?

Though if I'm not mistaken that is the role currencies have almost always played in the game.

I do believe that this ""2 to 3 weeks"" time will be what most players experience. But there is a reasonably good chance that it might be better than that for people who decide to work for it.

I said I can understand being pessimistic, because I am too. I just don't like when people are hyperbolic and have absolutely no faith in people who work at Blizzard, because I don't think that will ever help anyone. I am not saying to wait for 8.1 to start discussing this, but shitting on the developers when we have little to no information because they are probably discussing this right now is not healthy for the development of the game.

You are presenting your opinion in a very reasonable and constructive manner and that is what I think we need to see more on this subreddit, no matter how pessimistic or optimistic that opinion might be.

I also want to add that this system is mean to address one specific problem:

&gt; Throughout the discussions regarding Azerite Armor, there’s been a lot of talk about how you earn Azerite pieces from Mythic+ dungeons. Players have told us – and we agree – that the process of earning Azerite Armor through Mythic+ feels overly based on luck, and that there isn’t enough control in the players’ hands.

You can blame Blizzard for not making Azerite gear farmable if you think that would be healthy for the game, but you can't really complain that this system isn't doing that because that's not what it aims to achieve."	"M0s give epic azerite gear, so yes from what we know these pieces will give some of the currency when scrapped.

And 2 weeks for who ? someone who only does M+ and only gets the currency from their weekly cache ? Sounds pretty fair to me. Someone who does every M0 + LFR + NM + HC Uldir + PVP conquest cap + warfronts + every emissary and scrap every piece they get ? I think it's pretty safe to assume it will take them less than 2 weeks, but how few people are actually willing to do that ?

You're complaining as if back in BC or WotLK most currencies were not capped at all, well guess what they were timegated too and it was fine.

I'm sorry but to me it sounds like you want azerite gear to be handed to you because you do one or two M+10 a week.

And again, just like all of us you have no idea how much of that currency will come from the weekly cache and how much will come from scrapped azerite pieces, so you shouldn't present your assumptions as something that everyone should know will inevitably happen.

You are being pessimistic and I can understand why, but when you're telling people that they are wrong for thinking what they think based only on your own assumptions, you are actually being dishonest."	wow	wow	1

Does this $4295/month include property taxes, maintenance, insurance, and other home costs?"	"&gt;Also, no rural hospital on earth outside of afghanistan/iraq have neurosurgeons on call.

I'm not sure how you define rural but there are numerous level 2 trauma centers in places with 50k population, which doesn't happen in the UK.  By way of example, there are 4 in South Dakota and 3 in Montana, two states with less than a million residents.  It's difficult (and expensive) to recruit specialists to live in these places, but we do it.  We should celebrate our achievements and successes in this area.

&gt;Having a rural hospital doing neurosurgery is a recipe for disaster, regardless of location. Surgeons need volume to keep up their skills.

There's enough volume in these places to keep skills up, especially since the lack of colleagues means you'll handle relatively higher case volume.

My main concern with medicare-for-all is that we accelerate the adoption of a two-tiered public/private system where the bottom tier is much worse off.  We have medicare/caid-for-most (slim majority) currently, and they (more or less) have access to the same services as everybody else.  If you shift 50/50 to 80/20 then the 80% will be worse off.  And to service that 20% you have physicians (and now even specialists) fleeing into concierge practices which reduces their patient panels and reduces demand even further.

America is still white by a large margin. And since 57% of white Americans are, at best, willing to ignore racism in the highest office of government, i'd say that willing to accept a master race principle isn't too far of a leap. It doesn't take a majority to support that, it just requires a vocal minority, and an apathetic majority. 

&gt;Ongoing pogroms against citizens because of their perceived race?

Police target minorities at a significantly higher rate than white people. Black men receive, on average, significantly harsher sentences than whites who committed similar crimes. Black murderers are more likely to receive the death penalty. I can go on and on about the racial bias in our justice system if you have the time, I wrote a 15 page paper on it recently.

While true that not arms were involved, there has been an increasing amount of politically motivated violence. From mass shootings to people driving cars through protests.

The utility of that in everyday life to the individual means nothing, neither would history, anything beyond basic mathematics, literature, etc. The collective effort of these courses would provide the foundation for college education, but, more importantly, even without seeking college, they encourage critical thinking skills. Appropriate instruction methods in these skills should translate to healthy skepticism of claims, and adequate heuristics in teasing sense from nonsense. Creationism is just another seed of doubt on the scientific method. Students become confused as they're misled regarding what constitutes evidence, and led to believe that a PhD, alone, qualifies someone to dissent in a field they have no expertise in. Sometimes this can lead to, generally, harmless results. Linus Pauling made sweeping claims about the positive health properties of vitamin C. His status as a Nobel Prize winning scientist gave him substantial public influence that led the vitamin C craze, but the evidence wasn't there. Today, evidence suggests vitamin C can reduce the duration and lessen the severity of colds, but not prevent them, and certainly cannot, as he argued, cure cancer."

&gt; Regarding the Vedas, they are śruti, which means they they were originally knowledge transmitted by hearing.

So the Vedas began as an oral tradition. What do you believe about any potential for variance over the years of telling and retelling the stories? It is one of the more common arguments laid against the Bible (seriously, I think I only ever hear maybe five arguments and they're always the same -\_-). Does Hindu have similar arguments laid against its sacred texts?

I also have a clarifying question about something:

&gt;We should not remain in ignorance, thinking, “I am this body, I am American, I am Indian, I am brāhmaṇa, I am kṣatriya, I am Hindu, I am Muslim,” and so on. These are all bodily designations. When one comes to spiritual understanding, he understands ahaṁ brahmāsmi, “I am Brahman.” 

Is Brahman anything like a soul or spirit? Is it another existence of being? Or is it something different?"	"&gt;I'm saying that, objectively, the ""events of creation"" portion is false. Completely, absolutely, factually false. All available evidence and logic make this as close to certain as we can be about anything. 

The statement you are quoting says nothing about whether the text is or is not true or even what the reader is 'supposed' to get from it. I was only responding to somebody who wanted me to remind them whether the text should be read literally or figuratively. I provided a perspective on reading the words.

Here is the only statement I made that you could infer is me telling you what you're 'supposed' to get out of the text, from my initial post:

&gt;Where do we even begin to comprehend deity? With what he has given to us of his divine nature, namely scripture.  

It's a book designed to help us to comprehend the deity of God and his divine nature. Honestly, and I'm being entirely sincere here, you have a choice on what you get from the text. You can either approach it with honest curiosity as an academic would approach a text, or you can approach it dishonestly, bringing presumptions and biases into it with you. It's entirely your choice.

The Bible describes God's relationship with humanity from creation to the end times. The Old Testament should be read from an Ancient Near Eastern perspective and the New Testament from a Late Antiquity Perspective. In this way, you can try to understand how it's original audience would've read/heard it and it's original authors would have written it.

As far as telling you what you're 'supposed' to get from the text, I would encourage you to read it for yourself first.

&gt; I confronted him about it several times and he made it seem like i was awake when it happened and idk if i just cant remember because i was so drunk...

--------------

&gt; i guess i didn't see it that way because it could be possible i was blacked out and still talking and functioning and he didn't know I was blacked out??

-----------

&gt; Yea I was trying to remember if it was just drunk sex but I am pretty sure I woke up because I only remember the end where I realized what was happening and I got up to go to the bathroom.

&gt; Thank you. I really helps me to see it from an outside perspective. He was also drunk at the time but he said he remembers everything so ot as drunk as me.

If you're unable to consent, you're unable to consent. What OP is describing here isn't ""had a couple of drinks and got tipsy drunk."" It's ""best case scenario, I was blacked out, because if I was then maybe he didn't rape me."" 

You can initiate things with an unconscious partner and have it be totally fine from a consent perspective. It's called having those discussions in advance. MrPantzen knows that he's got free reign to try to wake me up if he's awake and feeling it in the middle of the night *unless* I've told him earlier that I'm not in the mood. But, you can't just stick your dick in an unconscious person and assume it's fine because they've had sex with you a bunch before. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

132	"There is the third way, the middle road that is usually here in my country. Whenever there's a strike, it be private or public sector, not everyone is taken out in a strike. Also the government is never really a part of the employer - employee conflict. A strike in every sector is legal, as long as it's not imposing an immediate risk for the public's health and safety.

Take health care workers, for instance. In a hospital it's not just taking care of emergency patients. They have a lot of people doing administrative work, surgeries that aren't curing life threatening conditions etc. The union along with the employers will sit down and take out a sensible amount of workers out in strike. The same goes for police etc. It's the administrative duties and non-emergency duties that go first. For instance here the police issue passports, so if the police is striking you probably won't get a passport. 

Schools being out doesn't inflict an immediate threat to the public's health and safety, especially considering the first teachers to be taken out in strike will be the teachers of students that are old enough to stay home alone. 

IMO this is a good option because it gives the employees the ability to strike if need be, however you are guaranteed that the government steps in if it goes too far. And usually once the government steps in with a forced agreement they will find some kind of middle path, meaning you could easily get something that neither the union or the employer are happy with, so it's also in their interest to come to an agreement. 

Also it's not in the government's interest to screw over the employees. This is people's jobs you're potentially fucking with, and that is something people will remember. "	"In a semi-well functioning system like we have the unions knows that asking for a lot more than what is possible won't work. And seeing as the union also pays the wages during the strike they don't have the ability to strike for all eternity. So they need to pick their battles. 

And just because I'm funded by the tax payer doesn't mean I should relinquish my rights as an employee. Secondly if you squeeze the public employees to hard, you'll lose even more of the good ones. Those who are smart or good workers and wants to be a health care worker, teacher etc and would go into the job with not only motivation but also passion will eventually change jobs, the bright ones of the younger generation will set their idealism aside and become workers in the private sector. Instead those teaching your kids are the rest of the bunch and uninspired, no desire or passion or joy to be a good worker and just do their job and nothing more. Don't try to inspire or anything.

A good union doesn't just want to get good terms for their people financially, they also want to make sure that the next ones coming in are people you want in the job because these are the people they have to work with."	news	news	1

I and this other guy had to drive in the oncoming lane for a half mile (otherwise it was an hour wait) to get past the god damn taxis who were waiting to get into their lane and some of them went apeshit.

Fuck taxis so much. They can't gauge demand because they have zero tech to help them so they all flood the airport when a plane lands. I wouldn't have even known about the road split if I had t been there before, and would've waited in that fucking taxi line for an hour.

If anyone is reading this and ever needs to pick someone up from LGA, get there a bit before the plane lands to avoid the taxi fucks, and ignore the assholes in vests telling you to move."	IAmA	IAmA	1
153	"Pod is strong because it creates consistency in a creature based combo deck. 

Your opponent can’t run you over if you have chump blockers

Your opponent doesn’t draw just counter spells

Your opponent is playing a game of chance just like you are, and when your game of chance only needs to resolve one 3 mana(because you are never casting this for 4 mana) artifact to win the game eventually, that is very unbalanced

Things you can do now 
1)Pod Voice of Resurgence into Renegade Rallier returning voice

2) If you have a sac outlet already; pod Saffi into Renegade Rallier, return Saffi, generate infinite ETB triggers

3) Easily find infinite mana with Devoted Druid and Vizear


I can keep going but pod would be literally the most broken thing in modern if it was unbanned. If you have constructed your deck correctly, it allows you to find almost whatever you need in the exact situation. 
Would it loose games? Yes
Would it loose a lot of games? No"	"It was banned because it limited design space; literally any new creature could break Pod

IE: The sadisi from fate reforged that tutors, or renegade Rallier from aether revolt, or Felwar Guardian(this let’s you double pod in one turn). I can keep going. 

Even if by some weird reason pod isn’t the best deck in the format; it will keep getting new and better creatures the more sets that are released. And it will eventually be the only deck in modern. That and the deck that is constructed to beat it.

That is why it was banned; not so the current creature decks would see play"	magicTCG	magicTCG	1
154	Thanks! Honestly, it sounded alright for someone who is super seriously into Christianity and spreading the gospel around the world. I’m just fundamentally opposed to that whole idea, so all Christian churches are cults in my view, and converting third worlders to Christianity is wrong on so many levels. But I understand that for a Christian it’s a simple matter of saving souls and racking up brownie points with God so your heavenly mansion is bigger. That’s all cool and everything, but I’d love to see humankind reject all of the crazy ancient religions. There are some modern views of spirituality that make so much more sense and are much less harmful to women, gay people, children, animals, the planet, politics... well, you know. 😊	Not to mention the way Republicans in Congress have been cheating every way they possibly can to gain advantages. I can’t tell you how disgusted I am with this Supreme Court trial bullshit they’re pulling. And that’s after they refused to give Obama’s nominee a chance at all.

155	"Some of the items are interesting and you could build around them, and some are just low level OKish items while you level your char. The bonuses they provide are reasonable and are not off the charts to be OP. But whats disturbing is the Magic Damage Reduced by % on the Rathma's shield. I dont remember such mechanic in the game on any other item - the only way to get magic damage reduction is by stacking it from different items, which is fixed number and not percentage. Whats interesting though is the description down below of how this works: ""All magic damage is reduced, except cold, fire and lightning"". This mechanic makes only sence if this 1.15 patch thing brings new boss encounter of some sort, which is dealing heavy Magic damage (think of Blessed Hammer or Bone Spirit skills), which I HIGHLY doubt will happen, therefore I think its fake."

IIRC, Argentina has been fighting against crisis stronger, harsher and longer than anything Brazil seen in the last years. Brazil has it share of populists but they do not govern in the same fashion.	"What you describe is a problem of *taxation*, not *welfare*. Which is a problem, since it  punish the *poorest*, not the *middle* class.

157	"I guess I still don't see the value. Given that you have warhorn anyway, and it can provide permanent regen, all water spirit really has is a 2s delayed moderate heal, versus the glyph which heals more, is up more often and also provides a minor condi cleanse and might. I could maybe see the use if you're solo druid, though I would worry about the lack of an on-demand heal, especially given that chaos chronos usually provide enough healing to keep the squad ""topped up"".

When running 2 druids surely you would be stealing regen ticks from the other, ruining their astral force generation?"	"Absolutely. While there are some good events (particularly in Vabbi), the vast majority are painfully bad in comparison to core Tyria ones.

Some examples:

* NPCs for events frequently spawn in and out in totally random location. In core Tyria most event NPCs exist in the world until their event starts, and hang around afterwards (sometimes to sell event-themed items). But in Path of Fire they will just despawn in the middle of a road, or behind some random pipe. Even when npcs in core tyria despawn, they always made sure to have them run into doors/waypoints so that it made sense for them to be hidden.

* Some events are on timers for literally no reason. Even if someone starts participating in an event, they will sometimes just time out when they're halfway done, wasting that person's time. And this isn't to make way for some other event, they just randomly have timers.

* Chained events are almost non-existent outside of the very simple metas. Further, a lot of these events just happen without any particular story, or they just throw waves of enemies at you every 10 minutes or so. While this structure is present in core Tyria, there is almost always a story-related reason for it and crucially the state of the world changes if they are failed. In PoF the state of the world almost NEVER changes in response to an event - succeed or fail the same outcome results.

&amp;nbsp;

Guild Wars 2 sold itself on the idea of a dynamic, adapting world. This is almost completely absent in the vast majority of PoF events. NPCs appear from nowhere, do something meaningless and without context, nothing changes, and they despawn again. I think the events have been much better in living world, but it is a real shame that the expansion (where they should have time for more detailed quests) is so lacking them."	Guildwars2	Guildwars2	1

167	"&gt;In this century, the minimum wage was passed that was supposed to let workers provide for a family.

This is not how economists see the minimum wage. Economists see the minimum wage as a price floor that makes demand exceed supply.

In any case, if you look at the right spots in major cities around the country, you'll find 2 or 3 bedroom apartments housing 4 to 6 illegal immigrants after they're done working their under-the-table jobs for half the minimum wage. The name of the current century is not a factor here; what matters is how much someone's labor is worth and how much employers are willing to pay for that labor."	"It is. For most of human history, people have had to share living spaces in order to make those living spaces work. Just imagine how Irish, Italian, and Mexican immigrants to the United States over the past century have lived in homes housing up to 20 family members.

Another way of thinking about it is this: think about the cost and labor needed to build a studio or one bedroom apartment. Building the foundation, bringing in cement and wood planks from around the country on a truck, the hard labor of hitting nails with hammers all day long, the cost and labor of installing walls, insulation, flooring, carpets, plumbing, electrical wires, internet cables, etc.

Now think about whether someone is willing to *trade* the final product of that labor for the final product of someone working a minimum wage job. If the apartment lasts for 100 years without needing additional work, then we're talking about trading in millions of pounds of cement and wood and tens of thousands of hours of back-breaking labor in exchange for 100 years of people grabbing burgers, putting it in a bag, and handing it to you through a window. 

There are other people out there that will pay a lot more to the people who build the house, to the people who cut down the trees and turn them into wooden planks, to the people who mine the limestone and gravel and convert it into cement with some heat, to the people who mine the iron ore that turns into the metal pipes that carry your water, and to the people who mine the copper and fabricate the plastics that turn into coaxial cables for your internet connection.

Those laborers are being told ""you need to work for less"" whenever someone says that ""a minimum wage job should be able to afford someone a one-bedroom apartment""."	Economics	Economics	1

And 2 weeks for who ? someone who only does M+ and only gets the currency from their weekly cache ? Sounds pretty fair to me.

I think it's pretty safe to assume it will take them less than 2 weeks, but how few people are actually willing to do that ?

You're complaining as if back in BC or WotLK most currencies were not capped at all, well guess what they were timegated too and it was fine.

I'm sorry but to me it sounds like you want azerite gear to be handed to you because you do one or two M+10 a week.

And again, just like all of us you have no idea how much of that currency will come from the weekly cache and how much will come from scrapped azerite pieces, so you shouldn't present your assumptions as something that everyone should know will inevitably happen.

One thing my therapist says to me all the time when I talk about my relationships is, ""Where is [my name]?"" So ask yourself, where are YOU and your needs in all of this?"	"&gt; I went to a party this one night with one of the friends he told me to cut contact with and I was super drunk and messed around with some guys after he told me not to do anything with anybody

If I'm reading this correctly, this was before you two even started dating, meaning he has no right to dictate your behavior. If he didn't like what you were doing or who you were hanging out with he could choose not to begin dating you.

&gt; He told me to cut contact with that friend because she was the one handing me drinks and he thought she was a bad influence.

You're in college, getting drunk at parties is normal. Unless YOU were saying that you didn't like the influence this friend had on you, it's not his place to judge that.

&gt; As for another friend, he thought that she was a snake and a horrible friend as she was telling my bf's friend about the stuff I vented to her about my boyfriend

I mean, from the sound of it he was pretty controlling of you before you even started dating, so I am inclined to bet that this was out of concern for your well-being. Unless she was disclosing details of your sex life or something, it's not snaky to relay worrisome facts about someone's behavior.

&gt; She used him for his weed as he would say and so he thought I shouldn't be friends with her even though we grew really close.

He doesn't get to decide who your friends are just because he doesn't like them for whatever dumb reason. Honestly, this sounds to me like an excuse to isolate you further from your friends.

&gt; Even a couple months ago I found that he had texted one of his girl friends something that was borderline cheating.

199	It's very unlikely. Narcissism is a defense mechanism and a means by regulating chronic negative affect. It's an emergent system that protects one from trauma/retraumatization. Its evolution likely depends on the kind of abuse one suffers rather than any externalities. There are subtypes too. Some narcissists actually show the opposite of grandiosity and latch onto others they hold in esteem (until inevitably those others fail them in some way or another). 	Basically all trauma has variable effects depending on circumstances on the formation of your right brain/limbic system that result in various issues of emotion regulation. Living in chronic stress and an abusive household can have effects ranging from personality disorders, to PTSD, to bipolar/schizo, and even autism in a subgroup of people. All of these things  cause certain malformations or under/over development of right brain circuitry, where you process basically everything dealing with emotions from facial expressions to vocal tones to attachment schemes and really anything that's become associated with an emotional state like dropping a glass if historically that got you threatened. In short, without help, these things tend to follow you into your adult life and affect your relationships with others and yourself, at least when your abusers were also your caretakers, i.e. attachment trauma. In the case of BPD for example there is an 80% intergenerational inheritance rate. So, yes, these things can definitely be heritable. There's no surprise that bipolar and schizophrenia too have high heritability and one of the best prophylactics for schizophrenia is a supportive family. There are genetic factors but it looks like many of them are such that your home environment actually mediates whether those genes cause you to be less resilient or *more* resilient.	IAmA	IAmA	1
200	"See some of my other comments. Its a balancing act between monetizing a site and pissing off users and I am on the fence about the pop ups that say hey turn off your ad blocker please. I hate begging users to change their behavior. 

Also a lot of publishers are moving to server side ad insertion for video ad assets. This gets around adblockers because everything gets transcoded as one stream, passed into the player, and played. The only way to block the ad in this case would be to block the entire video stream. 

Also there are a lot of systems at play and some of the larger more reputable publishers are actively fighting against fraud, malware, malvertising, etc... being injected into user pages. If you make users angry they will go somewhere else (abandon the site) or find ways around the problem (ie.. adblockers). 

Believe it or not ads can be incredibly complicated to implement and monitor. There is also pressure from the online community, the governing bodies that create ad standards, the ad servers changing their specs, the ad networks, agencies, and advertisers themselves. 

Things are constantly in flux and I personally do not want to be the guy that causes the sites I work with to get attacked by malware. That not only hurts users but also hurts the publishers reputation. "	"Its a delicate balancing act between a good user experience and trying to make money for your site(s) and I would rather have some ads than a subscription service. I pay for enough of those already without having to get 10 more for the sites I frequent most.

Also video advertising is an interesting animal and Google/YT is an interesting use case. 

Ad blocking and poor user experience (ie. that 4-5 second delay between ads and content) have caused a lot of sites to do server side ad insertion (SSAI) for their video ad creatives. That provides the publisher with a way to keep users from blocking the pre, mid, or post roll ads and it crates one seamless stream of ads and content (similar to how you watch TV today but with no fast forward button)."

Try not make the mistake of lumping all atheists in this category though, I would say the majority of atheists don't think this way. "	I think it's neither completely a choice nor completely an outcome, I think it resides somewhere in the middle, leaning one way or the other depending on the person. Many factors do go into it: for example, a believer may find validation in their belief if they have experienced a miracle that supports it. In that way, they are still choosing, and they could choose to disbelieve, but they have an easier choice to believe based upon what evidence is available to them - it would be unreasonable to disbelieve unless they found more compelling evidence to disbelieve. So yes, it is somewhat a choice, largely based on reason, evidence, and experience, all three of which also make it somewhat an outcome.	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

210	"It has seemed to me that internet-/reddit-/new-/agnostic- atheists have resorted to playing fight-fire-with-fire word games to counter the word games and bad logic of theists. 

Take for instance your bit,

&gt; New Atheism actually flirts with being a belief system – something many Reddit atheists seem to passively assert and support (except when pressed they will go back to rejecting that atheism is a religion.)

This was a common fallacious rabbit hole theists would drag the argument down; atheism=belief, theism=belief, belief=belief, belief=religion, atheism=religion, therefore you're the same as us and either belief is equally likely.

Couple that with the word ""belief"" being used as a synonym for religion, ""belief"" became a pejorative word to those atheists, so now they reject out of hand by creating the a/gnostic-a/theist combination and claiming they do not have a belief. 

Otherwise, I would agree with the rejection of nouveau atheists' defining of words like atheist and agnostic as *the* definitions of the words, and think ""agnostic atheist"" is a cop out term and ""gnostic atheist"" is, or should be, untenable to an atheist. Plus the whole thing would be contradictory to any claim atheism isn't a belief. "	"&gt; &gt;Atheism is a belief that there are no gods.

&gt;That's your definition of atheism. You are not the one to decide what we believe and what atheism means.

That's not *my* definition, that's *the* definition for some 500 years now. 

In as much as you want to trust etymology on line, 

&gt; atheist (n.) 1570s, ""godless person, one who denies the existence of a supreme, intelligent being to whom moral obligation is due,"" from French &gt;athéiste (16c.), from Greek atheos ""without god, denying the gods; abandoned of the gods; godless, ungodly,"" from a- ""without"" (see a- (3)) + &gt; theos ""a god"" (from PIE root *dhes-, forming words for religious concepts). 

Can't find some earlier uses of atheist that make it clear that atheist = does not believe God exists, but here are actual dictionary entries

Websters 1828 Dictionary of the English Language
&gt; Atheist

&gt; A'THEIST, noun [Gr. of a priv. and God.]
&gt; One who disbelieves the existence of a God, or Supreme intelligent Being.
&gt;
&gt; A'THEIST, adjective Atheistical; disbelieving or denying the being of a Supreme God.

&gt; DISBELIEVE, verb transitive [dis and believe.] Not to believe; to hold not to be true or not to exist; to refuse to credit. Some men disbelieve the inspiration of the scriptures, and the immortality of the soul.



Dictionary of the English language by Samuel Johnson 1768, 3rd edition
&gt; ATHEIST One that denies existence of a God Bentley 


&gt; DISBELIEF To disbelieve; credit denial of belief.  To DISBELIEVE va dis and believe to credit not to hold true


Dictionary of the English language by Samuel Johnson &amp; John Walker (1828 edition)

&gt; Atheism n The disbelief of a God 
&gt; Atheist n One that denies the existence of God 

Webster's Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language 1989

&gt; Atheism: 1. the doctrine or belief that there is no god. 2. The disbelief in the existence of Gods. 

It is also ridiculous for Huxley to coin a word for his position that he did not accept the position of either atheists or theists if atheist meant not having a belief,  

&gt; When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last. The one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which I differed from them. **They were quite sure they had attained a certain ""gnosis,""—had, more or less successfully, solved the problem of existence**; while I was quite sure I had not, and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble. 

So atheists of his time were sure about something, they had *gnosis* aka knowledge of it, plus atheist is atheos-ist not a - theist, but everyone is wrong all this time until some random people on the internet set several hundred years straight? 

&gt;  I have to agree with my fellow atheists: it's us to decide how atheism is defined. We don't define Christianity the way we want. Christians define the word.

First, that's AKA the no true Scotsman fallacy, which Christians are accused of all the time by atheists. Second, language is agreed upon, so a band of supposed atheists cannot change the meaning of the word for all atheists let alone for everyone one when the word was perfectly sound previously. 

&gt; &gt; It's funny how everyone new here has the wrong definition of atheist

&gt; Or: you have the wrong definition.

""Me"" has nothing to do with it. When people outside of this sub come in using the same definition of atheist that I've now shown to be THE definition of atheist of record, and are corrected hear of what atheist ""really means"" by ""atheists"" using incorrect etymology, the problem is not them, but the minority here. **it's no longer a case of ""agnostic atheists"" choosing a label for themselves, it's a case of historical revisionism in order to avoid having to argue the position of believing there's no god.** "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

215	"&gt;&gt; No. I, like most of the middle class (who used to make good money doing manufacturing jobs), have had our jobs shipped overseas so that corporations can pay workers less.
&gt;

I don't understand why people like you think that shareholders - who provide virtually nothing to a company - deserve all the company profits, while workers struggle to make ends meet.  Or need a second job.  And are denied healthcare, and medical leave, and just a plain vacation.

If all the workers are ""used up"" (physically and emotionally), there will be no workers to make the product that the rentiers depend on  for their profit.

Also, when all the resources are used up, where are the 1% going get their higher ""returns""?

&gt;People running corporations have a fiduciary duty to do their best to maximize profit for their investors, not employ more expensive workers.

Shouldn't they also take care of their resources?  Workers are a resource.  Once the people in Asia are tired of being treated as slaves, they'll demand more rights and higher wages and be ""more expensive""...

They could use products that are produced using sustainable practices.  (Which is what was promised, but there will be a slight delay since there's still some old growth forest out there.

&gt;&gt;As far as healthcare goes, we all pay for the uninsured.

&gt;...if we go to a single payer system, so it will be cheaper (according to collectivists everywhere), that's when you really see the costs spike, since it will drive demand through the roof.

According to whom?

&gt;And how many people file for bankruptcy due to medical costs? You think that's not paid for by the rest of us?

&gt;&gt;So, your solution is to subsidize those people that don't pay for their own care even more, driving up demand even more.

This Netflix Diablo rumor started 3 weeks ago from Revenge of the Fans.	"You believe D2 remastered and Diablo Netflix having no official confirmation of either, but you don't believe D4? Or choose to deny yourself the hope it might be announced? It's not hard to wait until BlizzCon to find out without discarding possibilities. D4 is possible. D3 was announced out of the blue.

Nevalists: ""The forges here at Blizzard are burning hot, and we have multiple Diablo projects in the works, some might take longer than others, but we might have something to show you later this year.""

The title ""Future of Diablo"" tells me D2: Remastered is not much of a future. I think there is a new game coming. It might be an expansion, a new Class pack, or Diablo IV.

I recently tried nic salts for the first time and got a wild hair... I found a Mini Zmax in a vape shop that had been sitting there so long they pretty much forgot about it, and picked up a GeniTank Mega for it at a different shop. Under $30 total. I've been mostly using it DTL but it works well either way... and I've been using 35mg on 1.8ohm coils at 8.5w.

I started vaping around 2012-2013 and went from gas station cigalikes, to Egos with CE5s, to VV/VW setups with Protanks and Vivi Novas, to SubTanks and TFV series, to AIOs like the iCare and Breeze and back to TFVs again. I was just thinking how I miss the earlier stuff and wanted an old school head turner.

I love my Big Baby Beast but it gets a bit expensive to run and the clouds aren't always ideal when I'm at work or out and about.  Also kinda sucks to carry around a big bottle of juice everywhere to keep it filled.  My Breeze just isn't quite doing it for me, although I haven't tried it with nic salts yet and I prefer to have a replaceable battery these days when I can help it. I think the original Zmax was the last mod I used before going to subohm in the first place, and that thing was bulletproof. "	"I've rewrapped a few batteries, I always took the old wrap off.

I just reused the insulators from the original wrap. It doesn't have to be adhesive, just put it in the right spot inside the wrap  before you heat it up and it's not going anywhere. I don't think the adhesive would hurt anything if that's what you mean."	electronic_cigarette	electronic_cigarette	1

The reason I have what I have is because I feel like it shows that I've done a good amount of traveling in my life. That way, if someone asks a question that I respond to, maybe they'll look at my flair and say ""oh, this person looks like they've traveled abroad a lot, so I can consider their input to this discussion in a different way compared to someone who maybe has just been abroad once in his/her life."".

It's true that it can be tacky seeing a # of countries visited, but I want to be a contributor to the forum, and I feel like my 30+ years of traveling (especially) abroad can be helpful to some. By keeping a little flair next to my name, my thought is that maybe it'll show the person asking the question that I've done much more than something like backpacked around Europe or SE Asia out of college. Or another angle - one could probably infer by my flair that I'm not young, so if a younger person was asking for advice, and I responded, maybe they wouldn't want to listen to my input for that reason.  

I don't know. I think there has to be a good way to be a part of this forum where people can understand the background and experience of the respondents. Sometimes certain questions can get a wide range of responses, and some of that has to do with the age and experience of the responders. I feel like the flair can help in that regard, so that's why I keep what I have. We all come from different walks of life. Understanding a little bit of that context should help when someone reads responses. But I agree with your overall sentiment, and that's why I don't post the exact # of countries I've been to."	"So....are you talking about getting status or just collecting miles?

If the former, then I don't think Delta (which I am a business traveler of) will work for you. In order for you to get Delta status, you have to BOTH fly a certain amount of miles AND spend a certain amount of dollars. If someone else is paying for your travel, I'm guessing you will only get the miles flown, which means you will never get status on that airline.

I don't know about United and Southwest, apologies.

If you're looking to only collect miles, I think the question is what you want to use them for and where you want to go. Delta and United both offer good options for international travel. If you want to save miles for an int'l ticket, I'd advise you to go with one of those. The issue is that you're probably going to have to do a good amount of traveling before you rack up enough miles for a decent int'l ticket.

"&gt;All they are doing is increasing the scarcity of equity available on the open market. A price increase caused by scarcity is only economically beneficial if it is prompting some increase in production and supply in response. If it's not causing an increase in supply then it's actually economically harmful. Stock buybacks do not prompt any increase in supply, in fact their entire purpose is to limit supply for the benefit of equity holders. It is an example of cartel like behavior where investors are simply increasing the price of owning corporate equity without actually causing any increase in value.

&gt;Does that strike you as sound economic logic? 

I don't think your characterization is sound at all.  In fact I find it downright strange.  

&gt;A price increase caused by scarcity is only economically beneficial if it is prompting some increase in production and supply in response.

Possibly true, but that increase doesn't need to be in the original market.  It can be almost anywhere.  Some public firms will increase investment, others without sound projects return money to shareholders where it finds its way into higher value investment opportunities.  That does not have to be in the publicly traded equities, but much of it undoubtedly will.

240	"What you are talking about are legal ramifications for breaking the law. I am talking about contractual pensions that are agreed upon ahead and a clearly laid out contract is signed by both parties. This agreement has stipulations based on conduct while in the course of completing the requirements of the job. If someone were to deliberately break that contract by say, raping children you were employed to care for, you no longer qualify for the benefits of employment if the contract stipulated no rape.

If you disagree and think that an employee should still get their pension, I would like a better argument than other people get their 401k even if they break the law. It's a completely different contract and if child rapists want to have a comfortable retirement they should try harder to not get caught or have a contract that doesn't say your pension is dispersed after review based on several criteria including the PPA(Pension Protection Act). This Act is there to protect employees from companies fraudulently withholding pensions but has clear cut stipulations on why and how this can be done.

"No one really knows what vocations are available to you except cmpb, it really depends on the needs of the army. Infantry is a given, theres always a need for more infantry specs. Altho if you get jnfantry and get posted to tekong thats a very different life versus being posted to one of the infantry battalions. The rest really depends on where there is a need. The thing about your vocation being determined prior to enlistment isnt true. 

We cant tell you which coy is more slack because OCs and regulars change all the time.

As camps go, PLC isnt actually that bad a camp, so be careful what you wish for regarding getting a vocation thats not in infantry for pro term. If you end up in armor and going gedong you will wish you stayed in PLC, for example. Then again you could strike gold and get chong pang camp or something.

Did infantry pro term and later fot posted to 1SIR. Not gonna lie to you, infantry is a hard life, lots of outfield/marching and none of the glitz/glamour of armor/guards/commando. Becoming a commander has responsibilities and priviliges. Yes you can OOC/CK now and have a relatively easier life now versus pushing through SCS and getting some say about how you run your life back later on (and more money). I find its also much more productive than being a commander some clerk or saikamg storeman in terms of your personal development.

This doesn't make any sense.  We're talking about using a larger sensor, so your analogy implies a differently sized bucket.  That's the point.

252	"This doesn't affect the preorders from WotC's end at all. All of that is pretty much predetermined by agreements they have with distributors, and many distributors have requirements for how much product stores must buy to guarantee product.

These BAB promos are limited and determined based on a store's WPN level. Not something that can drastically change. Nobody is saying this move is going to singlehandedly save an LGS, but it truly does help. The fact that this promotion has limited quantities means people who want it often need to preorder to get them. Preorders are huge for LGSs. The money that sits in product upon a new release is a massive burden for stores. Preorders allow stores to free up their funds from being tied up waiting for release and waiting to sell, and allow that money to be invested in other places."	"I get the frustration of your store not being a WPN member and therefore not getting promos like this,  but that very example proves that it isn't just about selling boxes. If it were strictly about selling boxes, the promos would be made available to any store that sold the product, not just WPN members. By making this promotion for WPN members it is WotC supporting LGSs, not just places that sell product, but places where the game is played. This encourages stores to host events and become WPN members. If you want to support your comic book store, but still want promos in the future, talk to them about becoming WPN members.

And, I can't stress this enough, this promotion does not in anyway directly result in more money for WotC. All of what they initially move is predetermined by contracts they have with distributors, that is not impacted by the retail level. These initial print runs are going to sell out with or without promos. WotC is going to make their money. What makes them more money (or costs them money) is interest in the product further after release, long after the promos run out, when the only thing selling the product is the quality of the product itself.

This promotion is for the benefit of LGSs (specifically WPN members. Yes, WotC benefits in the long term, because more stores are going to be WPN members, meaning more places are going to run events, meaning more opportunities to play, more people getting introduced, and an increased demand for product, but they will in no way directly profit from this promotion. That is all for the benefit of LGSs, getting box sales, and specifically preorders to help get their equity out of being tied up in product, and able to reinvest.

WotC is far from perfect. This promotion isn't perfect. But it is not cynical. It is not a bad thing. It really does help with stores.

If you don't want to buy, or can't afford to buy a box, these will certainly be available for purchase on the secondhand market. The fact that it will mainly only see play in singleton formats will help keep the price down. And I know you said you won't believe it until you see it, but they have said if the cards are in demand they can and likely will be reprinted, and I have no choice but to take them on their word for this. To demonstrate how they are on keeping their promises, I point to the Reserved List. At MaRo's panel this past weekend, one of the things he said was that if he could go back in time, he would prevent the RL from happening. They realize the problems and the frustration it causes, but it was a promise they made, a promise that many people made financial decisions on, and to go back on it would be a violation to them.

258	Honestly with her not eating bread or noodles (my main source of calories currently.) I'm worried about her calorie intake. She gets dizzy from the lack of calories (just my guess) and I have to try to get her to eat apples or something like that to get it in. Also if I can get her to eat more than a meal a day I'm lucky. I guess I should have mentioned in my post she used to be heavier and she really wants to get started working out. I'm sure having her hit the taget food goals would help with her energy and motivation to try her new workouts.	We only drink water, eat vegetables and turkey meat. Based on other comments I'm going to help with portion size based on my fitness app to get the numbers where they need to be. Honestly I completely understand everyone saying diet and everything it's fair to assume she eats a bunch but really it's not like that. She has been consistently coming down in weight from where she was but is stalling out. Now she walks a lot but doesn't really work out other than her walking. She just wants some help getting on the right track work out wise, but I am going to check our food numbers and portion sizes. She has no problems eating less if it'll help her lose weight.

262	"This comes up rarely now, but it’s still happened enough in my life that I’m entirely unwilling to spend the better part of yet another conversation defending my life choices. 

The most recent example was from an adult student in a colleague’s class (we’re both instructors). He asked if I had kids. I said I do not. He gasped and *demanded* to know why. I politely but icily told him it was none of his concern and turned to talk to someone else. 

Before that, I had a colleague angrily snap “well *I* think you’d be an *excellent* mother!” after asking if my now-husband and I were planning on having children. I told him I disagreed and left the conversation. 

If the question comes up, it comes up, no worries there. It’s a pretty common getting-to-know-you question and I won’t begrudge someone for asking.

With that being said, I also think it's very disturbing when one ideology tries to co-opt another ideology. And it sure appears like neoliberals, at least on Reddit, are trying to co-opt libertarianism. To this end, I can only conclude that not only are they not my ally, but they may very well be hostile to libertarianism as well. I don't care about feel good points, so I won't team up with someone I disagree with just to call out alt-rightist and trumpians. I criticize these factions on my own terms, independent of what some other ideology thinks. It's not gatekeeping, it's reestablishing the fundamentals of libertariansim. And for the record, there's much infighting within the libertarian community about reforming the libertarian party. I wouldn't suggest taking the LP's approach as the libertarian ""manifesto"" to how libertarians think and believe. For instance, more libertarians disapprove of candidates like [Bill Weld](https://beinglibertarian.com/5-reasons-hate-bill-weld/) then approve of them. So just because you hear the LP take a stance on something, it should be taken with a grain of salt. The party needs reforming badly."	There's no doubt leftist are the majority here.

282	"The thing with some women is that, when It comes to dating they often fail to be straight forward with intentions. When interested/ not interested they give out subtle hints, not straight forward ones. Ive been in both situations, one girl was just leading me on, second was really interested. Nether of them were straight forward with their intrest, plans with me. Both of them were flitrting with me while texting. Only Difference being, one was always too busy to go on an actual date with me and the second one was willing to go or reschedule when date night happened to be on a busy night. You basically have to read between the lines.

Even my ex did that. Some guy who was a masseur was also trying to get to her when we were starting dating. He was like, ""I really need some practice, would you be interested in free massage?"". She said why not and multiple times even scheduled a time but she never went, always canceled at the last minute. That guy was pretty consistent and that probably went on for 1-2 months, before he gave up. Poor guy, lol. But shame on my ex for leading him on. Point of it is that she might be interested in another dude.

I would do this- drop all communication for a day or two. See if she picks up conversation her self (sign of intrest). Yet, if she does not, that dosent mean she is not interested (although, it is not too great of a sign), maybe she is waiting for you to make the move (again).

After 2-3 days of silence, pick up the conversation your self and eventually ask her out again. If she declines again, move on. There is probably someone else. If she is interested she will make room for you.

294	"So you had a few questions there. To start though, you're going to want to be super careful with running when you're that heavy. It can and will wreck your knees. If they hurt, stop and see a doctor about whether you should continue.

To answer your questions:

- As you're new to running, the volume there is pretty low. C25K is designed to get your joints used to the stress and your cardio able to keep up. I think you'll be fine adding leg work to your lifting routine. It will probably help a lot with injury prevention. Running while overweight is super hard on your joints, but being strong enough to keep good form when you're tired can help.

- With the rest of your lifting, at this level it isn't really going to interfere with your running. TBH I would pick any program that looks reasonable from the sidebar, maybe focus on one that can be done in 2-3 days a week so you have more time for running. Your only real limit right now is going to be the amount of time you want to commit; I don't know how long a day of C25K takes for you, but most of the commonly-used lifting routines take about an hour in the gym.

As to the rest, well, you know the story. Getting control of your diet and stopping smoking are going to be the best things you can do for both running and lifting. Your post is full of red flags of someone who hasn't figured out that your health is completely under your own control, and is not dictated by outside factors:

&gt; Nutrition is tough because I always go for cheap and easy options 

""I'm too lazy to follow a healthy diet"". It's harder to be overweight than it is to eat healthy. I know, I've been there.

&gt; I have access to a gym, but it can be busy.

All those people at the gym are there working out even though it's busy. That's not stopping them.

&gt; I've tried doing better with eating

""I've tried"" implies that you failed, or at least you aren't being consistent. Figure out why and fix that. You can't outrun a bad diet.

Don't make excuses, don't give yourself permission to fail because then you will.
"	"If you enjoy it and it's working then keep with it. Just take all of the comments here about your knees seriously - if it starts hurting or they're achy after runs, etc., then don't think ""I'll just power through this"". Joint pain is not the same as muscle soreness, and isn't something that you can or should work through.

&gt; try to find

There it is again. This is the mentality of giving yourself permission to fail. Healthier options are out there, the only reason not to find and implement them is lack of effort. If you want to be healthier, make it your priority and it will happen. If it's not a priority, there will always be something in the way."	Fitness	Fitness	1

First, let me help you see my perspective here, and feel free to correct it as some info I'm working with, am no expert at. For example, I've always  been a layman physics reader but I also enjoy as much, subjects of philosophy or even ""mysticism""/spirituality (I like pretty much everything tbh) but Im not a scientist nor a scholar on those subjects (I'm an artist). So the main point of all this research I had is if, that which we call consciousness, is indeed a **non\-local** phenomenon. From a cold\-ass scientific perspective, what I understand is it can't be proven nor disproved, and though some prominent father\-figures of quantum physics have ""hinted"" towards non\-locality, I will keep my verdict for this at 50\-50. So the next best way to find out is either die or trust the words of some people with extreme and profound near\-death experiences (NDE). Here is were things become really subjective so I wont analyse further. But nonetheless, my scale tips towards non\-locality. This, meaning that we are connected at some level, ""we are part of the One"", ""we are children of God and God is within us and everything around us"", I can dig that.  Why?  Because this is fractals, yo.

310	Well the function of not being able to fire people because of union activity is indeed a function of the government (though the requirement to have legitimate cause when firing a union employee usually stems from the CBA as well). We were discussing a CBA requiring employees to join a union however. The way to fight a governmental function (like protecting union activity from termination) is not by enacting more government (right to work). Fighting government with government is how a bloated alphabet soup bureaucracy forms.	Let's say a group of the workers freely and consensually start a union. One of the things they negotiate with management is that any new employees hired will join the union. After that term of employment is made publicly known to any potential employees, those potential employees are free to ponder if they would join such a company or decline and work elsewhere. Any employee who has chosen to work at this company has thus consensually chosen to join the union. They may have begrudgingly joined because other pros outweigh the cons of joining a union to them, but they evaluated the whole package and made a free choice. An employee has a right to choose where they work, but this doesn't necessarily give them the power to chose ala cart the conditions of where they work. To use the government to enforce such ala cart choice (right to work) serves to nullify an existing agreement between two parties in favor of a future hypothetical 3rd party. This infringes on both initial parties exercise of self determination.	Libertarian	Libertarian	1

As far as Cuba goes, I mistakenly had thought that the Cuban revolutionary government was pressured into authoritarianism measurably through external interventions materialized in embargoes. Quite the contrary, though, it appears that Cuba's regime operated less in the way that revolutionary socialists think of as actual socialism (mass democracy or ""socialism from below"") and more in the way of Stalin's USSR (undemocratic state control of industry or ""socialism from above"").

[https://isreview.org/issue/84/balance-sheet-cuban-revolution](https://isreview.org/issue/84/balance-sheet-cuban-revolution)

That said, the Cuban state's hold on power is still shown to have been dramatically worsened by embargoes and pressure from the United States and other capitalist nations. "	"Since it looks like u/dk4soc is gone, here's a take on Venezuela written by someone from the same political camp. Their crowd respects some of the honest attempts at improving the lives of Venezuelans that Chavez pursued, but they are also critical of how Chavez attempted to implement socialism from above using state power: [http://socialistworker.org/2017/06/07/did-socialism-fail-in-venezuela](http://socialistworker.org/2017/06/07/did-socialism-fail-in-venezuela)

The author points out how revolutionary socialists are fighting for ""socialism from below"" as opposed to ""socialism from above."" The difference is that ""socialism from above"" is a kind of society imposed by leaders with state power while ""socialism from below"" is a kind of society that decides how to run itself through mass democratic engagement. It only works if everyone in the society is able to participate in self-governance. The revolutionary socialists assert that Chavez used state power to generate socialism from above. He wanted to transform that into a kind of socialism from below, but ultimately failed due to oil companies orchestrating what they called ""strikes"" but were more realistically employer lock-outs in order to sabotage they Venezuelan economy and reinstate capitalist power.

**From the article:**

""BASED ON this understanding of socialism, it is impossible to identify Venezuela under Chávez as anything but a version of socialism from above. The origin of ""socialism of the 21st century"" in a speech by the president, with its first concrete steps handing more power to that president, is the very definition of ""from above.""

Defenders of the Bolivarian revolution acknowledge, of course, the reality that the first steps have been taken by friendly managers of the state--but they go on to insist that these steps have been crucial to the development of grassroots projects from below advancing the level of democratic engagement. In a recent interview for the print edition of *Jacobin* magazine, Gregory Wilpert states:

&gt;The fact is, historically, the government is oftentimes the main obstacle to revolution, right? But in Venezuela, suddenly you had a different kind of government, one that said: ""Hey, you can create these communes, you can organize yourselves, and so on."" Isn't that the government giving the tools to the people to participate in that revolution? To make their own revolution, in fact?

Under this conception, Venezuela's network of communal councils should develop under the sponsorship of the state, but also in opposition to it, as a revolutionary movement from below--one that would need to challenge the state at any point that it becomes an obstacle to the development of communal power.

This is a contradiction, to say the least, which can be seen in the very clear limitations on popular power in Venezula--especially when it comes to workers' power over their workplaces.

The actual experience of [the relationship between the government and working-class organization has been mixed](http://socialistworker.org/2007-2/641/641_06_Chavez.shtml), with the state picking and choosing which initiatives for workers' control it supported and which it didn't.

For example, even at the high point of Chavismo a decade ago, the government rejected nationalization as an option for Sanitarios Maracay, a bathroom fixture manufacturer run under workers' control after the employer abandoned negotiations. When the employer succeeded in ousting the workers' occupation, the government refused to intervene--because the factory wasn't ""strategic.""

And it must be remembered that even state-run enterprises, much less those under some real form of workers' control, have always been a minority in the Venezuelan economy. [As Anderson Bean wrote in a recent SocialistWorker.org article](http://socialistworker.org/2017/05/17/venezuela-at-an-impasse):

&gt;Despite its progressive language on participatory democracy and human rights, the 1999 Chavista constitution gives significant protection to private property in Article 15.  
In fact, between 1999 and 2011, the private sector's share of economic activity actually increased from 65 to 71 percent. The critical oil sector is dominated by a state-owned company, but other important industries, like food imports and processing operations, pharmaceuticals and auto parts, are still controlled by the private sector.

The limitations on anything that could be called ""popular power"" are even more obvious today with [the increasing authoritarianism of the Maduro government](http://socialistworker.org/2017/05/03/against-venezuelas-authoritarian-turn).

But even under Chávez, economic and political power in Venezuela remained overwhelmingly in the hands of a corrupt capitalist elite and an increasingly bureaucratized state that was in a position to control the amount of popular power it was supposedly encouraging.

Attempts at grassroots organizing through the communal network, though often very inspiring, remained subordinated to the bureaucracy. And meanwhile, the government, by simultaneously upholding and protecting privately owned industry, weakened its own position in conflicts with Venezuela's capitalists, particularly as the drop in oil prices hit Venezuela's oil export-based economy.""

**In the end, though, it is important to remember that the Venezuelan economy is especially a shit show because of the Venezuelan oil industry sabotaging it in an effort to topple Chavez.**"	IAmA	IAmA	1
313	"&gt; that once we know

Initially it was assumed to be just about our knowledge, but actually it is also aout reality. Reality cannot have the exact position.

The uncertainty principle applies to really many things, not just location. I would assume that it applies to existence too.

The problem is that it is difficult to find a good analogy for these, because on large scale things work differently.



"	"You will need to learn about the uncertainty principle, it is difficult, but  not impossible. There are probably good youtube videos about it.

I can try to explain it quickly. Imagine that two persons can communicate only with waves. And they need to communicate the position and speed of a thing in one wave.

Short wave means fast. Long wave means slow. And the object is within the position of the whole wave. 

Now they can give a short wave which means the object is very fast, and because it is short the location is precise.

But the slower objects they try to explain, the longer and longer waves they must use. But those waves do not give the position. And  a thing that is still would be infinitely long wave, so it could be anywhere.

Reality is a bit like that. Things cannot be still and have a precise position.

318	"Subjective. As a Tinker player, I can safely say he isn't overpowered. I take advantage of the fact that it pushes people out of their comfort zone (this is the keyword here, and why I feel most people get annoyed with Tinker rather than him being ""OP""). He simply requires a different approach to beat or play, but most people just want to stick with what they've been doing every game.

Most players employ reactionary Dota when playing against Tinker instead of trying to anticipate his movements. This usually leads to failure and frustration. When I play against Tinker, I try to put myself in their shoes. It's relatively easy stopping him from the get-go, unless the opponent is significantly higher skilled.

I say this because I have personal experience with friends and pub strangers alike that are upset when they have to play vs Tinker, yet they don't make any effort in thinking outside the box. No early ganks, no Tinker wards, no anticipation of where he will try to TP next; just plain old ""try to catch him in a team fight and hope for the best""."	"Like I said, it's subjective. You don't enjoy Tinker games; that's your opinion, and it's perfectly fine. But hero balance or even the playstyle shouldn't be shaped around these kinds of opinions, because whether you like it or not, different people have different ideas about what makes Dota for them.

For instance, I don't enjoy Phantom Assassin as a hero. I think she's too RNG-heavy and just poorly designed in general. Do I think she's in need of a rework? Absolutely. Do I think that her skill set should be changed to accommodate my playstyle? Not necessarily. I find her daunting to play against just like you would Tinker, but when I try to adjust my mindset, everything becomes different for me.

You need to embrace it. The sooner you do that, the better you'll feel about your Tinker games. Those mechanics you mentioned may be changed by popular demand, but in my opinion, it's completely unnecessary."	DotA2	DotA2	1

320	"I once accidentally boarded a bus that left Seoul and took me to a ski field in Pyongchang to go skiing so there's that. (I could not ski - I can now though so that's a win)

On the topic of boarding buses I should not board, I once boarded a bus to Barcelona from my home in Lyon because I really missed the beach and Barcelona was relatively close (6hrs by bus - which for an Aussie is no big deal). Well, Barcelona was great but their beach isn't very nice so I decided I would go to Seville (I know, wait for it). Turns out Seville is very far which I didn't realise so I ended up taking a bus to Madrid where I couchsurfed for two days before buying a ticket to Seville. On the last day my host asked me why I was going to Seville and I said ""for the beach"". Turns out there is no beach in Seville because it's not on the damn coast - I'm not sure why I had that in my head but for some reason Seville to me was *the* beach location in Spain. Anywho, like 21 hours of bus time later from my original journey in Lyon, I was in Seville. No beach but it was a great city, no ragrets ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

"	"I know this is really super unhelpful but I've been to all four of those cities you've suggested and all of them are great ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Personally I would pick Lisbon - it's probably one of my favourite cities. It's very chilled and laidback, absolutely excellent for just wandering around in (really great, artsy streets/buildings and plenty of cool little shops to shop around in), and you can get some really great hole in the wall food for very cheap. Bairro Alto is also great for going out in at night if you're into the chill bar scene - the entire district is essentially an open bar where people wander from bar to bar and sit down on the curb/hang around in the street etc, really great vibes. 

Sintra is just a day trip from Lisbon and while it's nice to see it's also *very* touristy so keep that in mind.

Séville is a great city to do nothing in - if you're just looking to sit down and read a book while drinking the best orange juice ever, this is the kind of place to do it. I spent a lot of time in Seville just kind of wandering around and watching flamenco dancers busk. It's probably on par with Lisbon for being the most beautiful city IMO. From memory there's not much of a nightlife here, although there is one ""secret"" bar that is neat to check out.

Ljubljana is also very cute and picturesque and makes for good wandering (although it's somewhat small so you might run out of things to do)  - I'd make sure to head to Lake Bled as well, that is definitely worth the trip and is really gorgeous. Google metelkova - its similar to Christiana in Copenhagen and is a great alt scene to go out in. 

Copenhagen is also pretty and makes for good wandering in a different way - it's more modern and has less of that cute European feel to it but it's an awesome city in its own regard. Lots of great small bars, there's Christiana of course, and there's Tivoli in the centre of the city (which you have to pay to get into but it's pretty neat to see all the stands and stuff inside, it's like a mini theme park/fête type deal). Tbh this is probably the most different from Budapest and Berlin though, with Barcelona being a close second to that. 

Have you considered the Baltics? Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius are really fantastic - Riga has a great low-key alt night scene (look up the bar Chomsky) and if you're into urban exploration/doing something different you can see if you can make your way to Skrunda-1 (basically Pripyat but without the radiation - very cool) in Latvia and Rummu (abandoned quarry/prison - like an hour from Tallinn) in Estonia. In Lithuania you can head to the curonian spit which is pretty great to bike around and do a mini hike on - it's got some really stunning unique landscapes. "	travel	travel	1

325	"objectification is a buzzword. It isint real.

When feminists complain about objectification they are usualy talking about pretty women on posters, but those women consented and got paid. How can they be objectified if they consented for it?
Another case feminists complain about is objectification of women in video games/comics and other fiction but this is just retarded. Images of virtual women or drawings of women are not women but objects. So yet again women dont get objectified so i dont see what the problem is about.

I think what this really is about is ugly unatractive women trying to level the playing field by lowering male expectations with shaming tactics, its the same thing as ""if you dont find fat women attractive then you are a pig!"""	I sometimes wonder why women are so easily angered and offended compared to men. For example, last day i was riding bicycles with my brother, we were doing fairly calm pace of 15km/h and we traveled total of 20 kilometers, its not much. We had fun the entire trip and little difficulties like getting caught by the rain/storm mid way and getting a little tired was refreshing and didint affect us negatively but just added to our little adventure. We can take any route we want, get tired, get wet, get sun scorched, fall down, bust a knee and still get fun together and there is no reason for any tension. But whenever i ride bikes with my girlfriend or do anything with her i always feel her pressure and expectations and her generaly not wanting to do anything that would even midly inconvince her or make her put effort into activity like ridding a little faster or taking the route she doesnt like. I mean its all trivial but she makes it such a big thing and she provekes fights about what route do we take or the weather we ride in. Whenever something is not exactly how she invisions it she gets mad at me and expect me to fix it or adapt myself to her expectations.	MensRights	MensRights	1

332	"&gt;You substituted for that premise in an effort to pare it.

The premise is necessarily true in both arguments. It is a fundamental truth required to make a choice. I simply spelled it out in mine.

&gt;You merely replaced God with ""will/nature"" of a person, but that's not what's in your first premise.

A person's will/nature is always in effect. I didn't say it explicitly but one cannot choose without having some form of agency. 

&gt;The point of free will is to have choice.

Free will allows someone to choose according to one's will/nature and not purely external factors. It isn't some unobserved quantum state.

&gt;That premise is far from tautological. People's will conflicts with their nature all of the time. If you confuse the two, it's no wonder you're so misguided. By definition, our will, if it's free, can't limit our choices.

I haven't conflated the two, I have ""merely"" avoided committing to either, as to show this works under any form of determinism, free will, or compatisbilism between the two. That is, regardless of the source of our agency, our agency has causal effect through our choices, free or otherwise. That causal effect guarantees only one possible outcome regardless of foreknowledge of the outcome.

To distinguish this outcome, from the outcome in the presence of God's foreknowledge, one needs to show a change in the conclusion. That only works if you can say it is now ""necessarily true"" that an outcome follows. 

&gt;You've said God has to have the causal power to make the choice necessary. By pointing that out, I'm refuting your argument. If you don't dispute that now, you don't really have a point.

I never said that. I said God's **foreknowledge** would have to have causal power. If perfect foreknowledge was given to someone else, it too would have to have causal power.

&gt;He's likely using ""necessary"" in the colloquial sense, and I suspect you know that, which makes you very disingenuous.

Taking a word at face value is disingenuous? I don't even have a response for that. I would kindly suggest softening the tone, focusing on the argument a bit more, and me a bit less.

&gt;And of course anything limiting what's possible conflicts with free will. Will, as I've pointed out, does no such thing, and nature certainly can. If it does, we don't possess free will.

Depending how you define free will. In any case I'm not making this argument. I'm merely showing why the original argument, in that form, is no longer considered viable in academia.

There are much better, and more importantly, viable, arguments one could make.

"	"&gt;Where is the modal fallacy in the statement that it is not possible that any other action could be taken if God knows what actions occur? 

That wasn't the original statement made. You said,

&gt;&gt;if god knows your actions then it is necessary that you will execute those actions, but if it is necessary that you will execute those actions then it is not possible that you could not execute those actions, therefore the actions are **predetermined** since it is **necessary they occur**

This is a modal fallacy.

However, the revised argument doesn't work either. It requires the logical necessity, otherwise the inclusion of God's foreknowledge as a premise is meaningless.

I can pare down your argument to simply be,

1. It is only possible to choose what one chooses.

2. A person chooses A.

3. Therefore only the choice A can possibly follow.

This is always true, regardless of whether God exists, knows the future and regardless of whether we consider it under any form of determinism, free will, or compatibilism. Noting I use ""choice"" loosely here.

What is *possible* is limited by ""choice"" itself. So there is no meaningful way to demonstrate the difference between this and foreknowledge when only considering what's ""possibly true"".

So adding a premise dealing with God's perfect foreknowledge is now irrelevant to the argument. It is only meaningful if it serves to establish the logical necessity of an outcome. Such that 2 would be restricted *logically* and *necessarily* to A, instead of 1 restricting the only *possibility* to A.

334	"&gt;Wrong. Most refugees are economic migrants who just can’t be bothered to do it legally. IE: they’re lazy and breaking the law to enter Australia. A great start right gnar? I’m sure the rest of their stay will be different!

By definition a refugee isn't an economic migrant as they are fleeing persecution, not simply migrating to improve their economic situation. The article you linked to is speaking about asylum seekers, not refugees. Even Howard's quote explicitly says as much: ""A whole bunch of people who seek to come to this country are economic migrants, who are seeking to comport themselves as refugees.”

&gt;How do you know they are a refugee when they enter with no documentation?

You use the procedures that are in place for exactly this type of thing. The UN will even do it for you if there is no domestic framework in place.

&gt;These refugees fly into Indonesia using a passport then ‘lose’ it before they enter Australia. Why’s that gnar when it makes them harder to identify as the genuine refugee they no doubt are?

People fleeing persecution may have nay number of reasons for doing so. To dismiss out of hand anybody seeking asylum because they don't have documentation is a breach of international law. Besides, the bulk of asylum-seekers that seek Australia's protection are found to be genuine refugees, which again means they aren't simply economic migrants.

335	"Few the most popular and well received shows:

**[Steins;Gate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd7BILZcYAY)**. If you like Sci-Fi you should definitely check. Best time travel show out there with perfectly executed story and subplot romance. Keep in mind that it has slow first half that is very important build up. 

**[Clannad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHdZOKm5xzo) + [Clannad: After Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVMJxT3O9qA)**.  It's probably the most unique romance out there and probably the only that doesn't end on confession and goes far beyond high school, explores struggles of adulthood and many other related things. 

It is sad as fuck from time to time but it's also inspiring and heartwarming as hell and often makes you look for some event's from other angle. 

**[Your Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2GujJZfXpg)** movie.  Gorgeous animation and art, great story, beautiful music and good entry for everybody.

**[Fullmetal Alchemist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsOlhzPEfY)/[Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uq34TeWEdQ)**. Best first option for new people.  Great epic story with dark elements, interesting and phylosophical themes, great world building and tons of great characters. If you have time - Watch original FMA first, make some break and then watch brotherhood. If no then only Brotherhood. 2003 version went anime original after some point because manga was still ongoing while brotherhood is full canon adaptation but they are still totally different stories that both deserve watching. 

**[Shinsekai Yori.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz1ypuGJ3VM)** Show about post apocalyptic world, but in not usual post 
apocalyptic setting. There are a lot of philosophic and psychological things along with interesting story and some very interesting plot twists. 

**[Parasyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm8UjBAS3cs)** Interesting story, a lot of gore, some romance. Very interesting to keep track of how main character changes during the whole show

**[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt26CSwCNao)** This is mystery thriller in detective style with pretty interesting story. It also has some pretty violent scenes.

**[Made In Abyss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91G8m9uM_0)** Don't be fooled by art style of the show, it's not happy children on happy adventure show. Probably the darkest show of this year(well, 2017 :P). Has very interesting story and world building.

**[Cowboy Bebop.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRI_8PUXx2A)** Personally I didn't like it a lot but this is indeed classic, it's really atmospheric and at some point you should definitely watch it.


**[Hunter x Hunter \(2011\)](https://youtu.be/28vSZ34w4mA?t=34s)** It's your not usual shounen.The show has pretty interesting story and surprisingly likable*(no matter how strange this may sound)* villains. It's worth all it's ~150 episodes.


**[Spice and Wolf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN_WgwEmRaw)** Very calm and beautiful show in medieval setting that follows adventures of traveling merchant and his wise wolf :).


**[Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C337shIT9LI)** Pretty popular and very unique show. Hard to describe it, it has comedy, slice of life, sci-fi, ~~Hitler~~ and one of the best male characters with his inner beautiful sarcastic monologue. Also sequel movie is masterpiece.

**[Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wPbJlFBUw)** Probably the best hype show out there.

337	"&gt; You're pretty optimistic considering Microsoft did this exact same thing when they were ahead with the Xbox 360.

This is why I made my comment above. OG Xbox -&gt; 360 was a complete platform change, so was 360 -&gt; One. Now the Xbox One is the only platform that will get incremental console upgrades but retain the platform and current library of games (including BC games). They can't cop out and say ""well this technology (cross play) is not possible yet for this generation"" and stop supporting it, they literally have to go out of their way to disable it. Making already released games like Rocket League and Fortnite just stop supporting crossplay. That will be a PR nightmare.

Not to mention XBOX has transitioned from being Microsoft's ""console department"" to being Microsoft's gaming brand, aka PC is part of it. First party games like Gears 4 and Sea of Thieves support crossplay between PC, that would be like taking an entire 360 stance (no pun intended) on the situation."	"&gt; if Microsoft outsell them then Microsoft may adopt the same position like they did last generation.

I don't think this will ever happen. Microsoft already said they are going generation-less, so the next console will have the same platform and games just newer hardware (think of it like a new phone that can use the same apps as older ones). It will be a PR disaster if they go out of their way to disable something they've been harping and egging Sony for."	Games	Games	1

CMC will probably get more carries than last year, but this backfield will be much more split than people are thinking. Not even just last year, the Panthers have a long history of heavily splitting work loads for RBs. It would be foolish to just ignore this. "	fantasyfootball	fantasyfootball	1
355	"That’s not really what the original poster was implying through their use of the term. The usual concern with human children isn’t that they are being re-given the same vaccine too often, it’s that they receive too many total vaccines too close together. 

Your post doesn’t really address that. My dog receives all of her vaccines in a single visit every three years. If I was the original commentator who was concerned with “over-vaccinating” the issue would be that she gets 3-4 different shots all in a row at the same visit, not that there is an ideal schedule for boosters.

What I would be interested in hearing is any clinical examples of occasions in which providing a pet it’s usual collection of vaccines caused an adverse affect, not occasions where it receives the same vaccine too often since that’s, you know, *not what we do to human kids.*"	"I have literally never heard that you can over vaccinate a pet. 

Seeing as things that are harmless to humans can kill dogs, and things that are safe for dogs can kill cats, and things that are safe for cats can kill my goldfish, and the fish tank that does so well to keep my goldfish alive keeps killing my guinea pig for some reason...well, it’s just a pretty stupid argument to pretend the highly varied group of animals know colloquially as “pets” would be physiologically equivalent to humans.

366	"Disclaimer: I'm not religious what so ever....

So if a priest is convicted of child molestation and it's proven, at that point I believe they would no longer be ordained. Meaning up until that point when the church condemns them they can give a blessing of any sort as an actual catholic priest. 

That being said if you're argument is that they lose their credibility the moment the act occurs (the act being molesting a child or some other heinous crime/sin), then I would in a sense also agree this is the case as it would be considered a sin I believe to molest a child, and therefore the priest would no longer be on a moral path to his god, but rather to some version of Hell. However the sin of the priest doesn't invalidate the beliefs of the people performing the Eucharist, and presumably the ritual was conducted the same way otherwise. So why would the Wafer and Wine be any less symbolic or meaningful to the believer who is otherwise unaware of the Priests misdeeds and themselves still presumably on a righteous path to their god? 

Following that logic is like saying a famous atheist scientist who made a startling and impactful discovery would have their work be invalidated if they were to later be found out to have mollested a child or any other crime of the sort. 

Or if you'd like another analogy, it would be like saying Bill Cosby's comedy or Kevin Spacey's acting were to no longer be considered good simply because of the disgusting criminal acts they were later exposed of.

P.S. When you insert matters of opinion like the ""brainwashed"" comment you left in parenthesis, you come across as a complete asshole and give non-religious people a bad name. "	"I suppose my stance is that the wafer is just a wafer in my own opinion regardless of who gives or receives it, and the nature of religion is that those people believe that regardless of who gives or receives it, the wafer is an embodiment of Christ and the wine is an embodiment of his blood.

As much as I want to agree with you that the hypocrisy of the priest invalidates the rather childish idea that the wafer and wine become literal body parts of Christ, to do so would in turn presume that religion to be utterly false. And while I don't personally think whats outlined in the Catholic Bible is likely to be an accurate story of how the world came to be, I also can't totally disprove it nor can anyone else really.

All I'm trying to say is if the decks are actually fun to play against each other and make for enjoyable games, the rules committee probably did the job that they were brought in to do. EV and mislabeling a deck sounds like a ""business"" decision. How would lowering the EV and falsely advertising a deck benefit the RC? I think threads like this are just invitations for people to blame the RC for all the wrong reasons. Yes, I too would have loved a sterling grove reprint, but do you really think they were the ones telling Wotc not to print it?

That said, there could still be some use for the anti-MOA here. If our justification for the premise that an MGB is possible is the same sort of justification which we would offer for the possibility that an MGB does not exist, then we can show that our reasoning produces a contradiction. Namely, by our reasoning, we should consider both the MOA and the anti-MOA as sound, which is clearly untrue. 

For example, proponents of the MOA will sometimes claim that since we can *conceive* of an MGB as existing that therefore it possibly exists. However, we might similarly *conceive* of an MGB not existing, which would entail that it possibly does not exist. However, that cannot be right since it would entail that an MGB is contingent. Hence, in this example, our inference from conceivability to possibility is flawed."	"&gt;If that is, indeed, what ""modal necessity means,""

It's terribly important that your digital presence recruits for you — that it speaks to the people and players you're trying to reach. Now you have coaches competing via tweets. I understand why it's important but that's not something I miss necessarily.   


So social media is crucial to the recruiting process these days. Once upon a time it was a much more straightforward and limited process. Before you could visit a home, make an impression on the parents and they discussed with a recruit the advantages and disadvantages of a particular school. Now the school has its own following and that following influences the recruiting class to get them to attend. Many times a friend or a classmate can have a huge impact in getting a player on making a decision. Before it was just the parents and now its expanded to include more people who you never had to consider before.

Jesus Paid our 10 bucks, now it's up to you to go to the club and do what there is to do.

Now an example from scripture.

We are asked to be faithful followers of Jesus Christ. Now how can you be faithful, if you're not doing something? The thing is, being faithful requires you do something Faithfully.

It's not complicated. If you have any questions about it, commit to being faithful about something. Like cleaning your room. Or telling your mother you love her. Once you have committed yourself to being faithful, you're follow through actions is what is keeping your faithfulness alive. If you do not do anything about what you promise to be faithful about, your faithfulness is dead. Your faithfulness is of no effect.

"	"Saying the code is meaningless because of the function signature is pretty silly.  My code is interesting for the same reasons that the OP's code was interesting: making random number generators that are suitable for secure applications is hard, and if you have a random number generator whose only problem is that its biased towards one result but is otherwise perfectly random, then my code or the OP's code shows how you can get an unbiased random number generator out of that.

Not knowing what types of memory issues you may be struggling with, my first recommendation is to always see a medical doctor for a check up and blood work. There may be something off with hormone levels, thyroid or vitamin deficiency behind your symptoms. 

Some general pointers would be to create a routine in your day and stick with it, use reminders in your phone or stick up some post-its, try getting 30 minutes of walking outside, quality sleep, potentially an antidepressant (ask your doctor), and psychotherapy to begin exploring what is behind your depression/anxiety and start addressing your symptoms.

And as far as the NFL protests go - the short and skinny of it is:

* A couple years back the NFL decided to take money from the US government and do acts of paid patriotism to help with Army Recruitment. 

* Fast Forward to 2014 when thanks to the improvement and prevalence of cell phone cameras and the ease for videos to go viral outside of their normal circles - America is treated to videos of black people being killed by police officers on an almost weekly basis. (You can argue that some of these murders are justified killings, but others are clearly not. It looks bad)

* Investigations are done and things like the [Ferguson Report](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf) paint a picture of a department with insanely racist practices - which are enabled by a general lack of oversight and hero worship that many departments enjoy in post 9/11 America. 

* The San Franciso police department is found to have their own insanely racist issues and their text messages are released as part of a [growing scandal](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SFPD-s-texting-scandal-Court-rules-officers-12955853.php)

* Representing an outraged community, a black quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers (An American football team) decides to protest the anthem in the preseason games of the 2016 season.

* After initial backlash and an open letter, Kaepernick spoke to [Navy Seal Nate Boyer](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/veteran-kaepernick-take-a-knee-anthem/) From this point on, Kaepernick kneels instead of sitting, to be more respectful about his protest.

&gt;We sorta came to a middle ground where he would take a knee alongside his teammate. Soldiers take a knee in front of a fallen brother’s grave, you know, to show respect.

* [Conservative media outlets](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/25/take-a-knee-how-conservative-media-is-reacting-to-nfl-protestors) and Donald Trump begin twisting the protests anyway to be less about a quiet protest to raise awareness of issues facing their communities and framing them as being disrespectful to the military.

* The quotes from now President Donald Trump prompts a show of unity from players around the league and more people begin kneeling in protest than ever, with owners standing on the sidelines with their players arm in arm.

* Kaepernick finds himself, likely due to pressure on owners in the league out of a job despite being a [Pretty Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I0cUTXwr-k) option.

* The President makes disparaging remarks and continues to use the NFL protests as a rallying cry - falsely equivocating the protests as being anti-military so as to distract from issues of police brutality and appeal to a base that believes that people being beaten and killed by police are just ""getting what they deserve,"" because of things like Trump [retweeting graphics](https://www.factcheck.org/2015/11/trump-retweets-bogus-crime-graphic/) that originated in places like stormfront.

"	"Early man thought God's wrath came in the form of lightning, volcanoes, earthquakes.

Science explains why these natural phenomena occur.

Herein lies the difficulty in pinpointing where God really is.  If lightning is a natural function of electricity and God did not cause it to strike that person dead, could God have still been acting to put in motion the events that led up to that particular release of electrical charge?

When science explains why something happens, religion simply backs up one step and puts God as the agent behind the natural phenomenon.

It reminds me of the ""I know you are but what am I?"" retort you often hear on school playgrounds.  No matter what the person is called, there is always a way out.


Likewise, no matter what science explains, religion always tries to one up it by putting God behind the explanation.

Think on this:  If science conclusively proves evolution.  If there is no doubt that humans developed over millions of years from single-celled organisms into the complex beings we are today, what will become of creationism?

Will it surrender and go quietly into that dark night?  Or will it back up a step and credit God for putting into motion the events that led to evolution?

Will they remove the chapters on how God created man?  Or will they change it to God created oceans of nutrient rich materials that coalesced into amino acids that formed compounds which led to cellular life?

Will they stop pushing a false narrative or merely change the narrative to reflect scientific findings?

444	... in the video it was kernel code causing the issues being seen in user space applications (mysql in that case).	"I think we're both basically agreeing with what was said in the linked video .. :)

However, I was responding mostly to this from your earlier comment:

&gt; But it can't do any more processing.

Which is inaccurate and symptomatic of the issue being talked about in the video. It *can* do more processing, as in it is not saturated by execution of instructions in the core hardware we generally mean by ""CPU"", but stalled (perhaps unnecessarily) by things like memory access. It is actually sitting idle, not executing instructions, when it could be (as in the case in the video). So it could be executing more, it could be doing more processing, there is more that CPU could be doing, but the software is getting in its way. It is an important distinction.

&gt; I don't see what this has to do with the CPU utilization metric somehow not 
&gt; being accurate for what it's meant to be.

There are two issues imo. One is the nomenclature issue which you mentioned, though I don't think it makes sense to rename CPU utilization (which we probably agree on) but to simply educate people writing software as to what it actually means (or perhaps, what it doesn't) and this video is a decent start to that.

The other is that in simpler times when CPU's were rather more straight-forward than they are today, ""CPU utilization"" did indeed mean exactly what it sounds like it means, and so received wisdom passed down over the years is that if you see high CPU utilization start profiling your code as if it were actually bound by the execution timing of the instructions your code compiles to.

The various caches, hardware threading capabilities, etc have changed all that, obviously, but many (most?) developers haven't adjusted to this. I recall a really interesting presentation some years by developers from .. Yahoo? .. on the PHP interpreter and how they sped it up significantly by focusing on parts of the code that were responsible for tiny amount of execution time but which were blowing the caches on nearly every call. They had been focused on CPU instruction performance, but the bigger issues were related to CPU cache invalidation.

For me, that CPU utilization metric is a placeholder of this general category of issue, where we (or at least most of us) are taught as developers to mainly pay attention to CPU vs IO (disk vs network vs ..) issues with the rest of it being either not really paid attention to or seen as dark magic for wizards to care about. 

So personally when I saw this video, I didn't see it as a critique of the CPU utilization metric but as a call to action to get us all thinking about things like blowing caches and TLBs, hardware thread stalling, ... but maybe that was just me :)"	programming	programming	1

448	English is a Germanic language and FRENCH is Romance. Modern English is mixed with Norman French. ...if you would have read what I said??	"*Hieroglyphs recorded consonants (+ ideographs, so you have symbols for concepts--like an ankh--mixed in with the consonants), people sub in the vowels with what feels most right. It definitely isn't an exact science, but it's close since there's only so many ways to pronounce consonants. You can base your pronunciations on descendant languages, like Coptic--which was used to help decipher Hieroglyphs in the first place if my memory serves me well. My field is medieval Northern Europe, so I work a lot with Old Norse and Latin. With both of those we look at what was passed down through written or oral traditions. There are actually several grammatical treatises written by Classical Latin authors, so we have a pretty accurate idea what Classical Latin sounded like--in the middle ages this could become a bit butchered, so there are distinctions between Ecclesiastical Latin and that used by Ancient Romans. Old Norse survives pretty faithfully in modern Icelandic. There are no questions about whether Þórr is the word the vikings used for their thunder god, or how to properly pronounce it. I'd be surprised if Egyptologists didn't get /some/ idea of the pronunciation of Ancient Egyptian from Coptic, based on my experience.

In the case of Egypt we have a lot of names the Greeks used, instead of the original Egyptian names. The Greek Ptolemy dynasty ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great conquered it. The god Thoth for example is named 'ḏḥwty' (pronounced probably along the lines of 'Djehuty' with vowels) in the actual Egyptian. The English we're speaking in right now is a mix of Germanic English and Norman French--which is a Romance language, meaning it is derived from Latin unlike Old English. The Romans took over Egypt (you definitely know the story), and the Romans used the Greek names as they used many Greek things. Language is fluid and the names for places/things change over time, but you can definitely trace the roots.

*disclaimer: My field isn't Egyptology (I'd like to think I could maybe be a hobby Egyptologist :) I've loved researching this stuff since I was a kid, and I minored in it during my undergrad) so a proper one could definitely fill in the details better, but here's my shot at answering your questions based on my experience in a related field."	askscience	askscience	1

True, there is no UBI, but there are many other government programs that - though not 100&amp;#37; effective - go a very long way to ensure that even those who do not work don't immediately die. Disability, food stamps, mandatory emergency treatment at hospitals even if you cannot pay, etc.

There are some good arguments for UBI, but ""it solves the work-or-die problem"" is a little deceptive, unless you are proposing UBI as a \*replacement\* rather than merely as a \*supplement\* for existing social programs which already do that."	"The problem with any quasi-free-market model of interest rates in the US is that US rates are mostly determined by policy. Market forces are merely allowed to tune quantitatively-modest credit and term premiums on top of the Fed policy. If you look at the long-run historical yield of 5% on, say, an intermediate corporate bond, about 80% was set by policy action, 20% by market action. So the answer to ""what happens to interest rates when X"" is dominated by ""whatever the Fed did/does to interest rates when X"". Thus investors closely follow and indeed overanalyze their every word."	Economics	Economics	1

It's really as simple as dictionary definition vs how people use words conversationally (which varies in certain regions). There's no hierarchy of respect between Ms, Mrs, and ma'am. Conversationally, all of those words are interchangable and used only to show respect when speaking. Using a title instead of the person's first name. Even though *technically* Mrs. means ""a married woman"" and Ms. means ""an unmarried woman"". Even in that case, it's not a difference in respect. It's a title given, a shorthand if you will, to quickly communicate a description of a person."	I agree. And that's why I called the other commenter ridiculous and silly.

Effectively more expensive by making it harder for people to borrow money to buy it--a concept I mistakenly thought was entirely clear."	"&gt; Because more resource are being diverted to housing from other purposes.

This is like saying the computer you are using to post is diverting resources that could be used for other purposes. 

I don't see why we have to downsize *the entire population* in order to serve the poor. And while I agree in principle to the idea that we could create a dorm-like atmosphere for housing the poor, I wonder how well that would work in practice. More importantly, I'm concerned with how zoning apartments which no longer are required to have the basic amenities of a kitchen or bathroom or even running water and sewer (which are only used in kitchens and bathrooms) may be abused by slum lords. 

I'm all for experimentation and loosening current zoning requirements, which I think are a bit bat-shit crazy. (Though note I'm not for reducing or eliminating requirements which add some expense to construction, such as snow load engineering or earthquake engineering--which explains why a magnitude 6 earthquake in Italy [kills hundreds](https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/europe/italy-earthquake/index.html) while [a significantly bigger earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Landers_earthquake) with aftershocks [even larger than the one that hit Italy much closer to population centers in Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Big_Bear_earthquake) killed only 3.)

But I do think we need to be careful rather than rushing head-long into deregulating the housing market."	Economics	Economics	1
464	I've done that before but I still order food, I'd order an appetizer for my meal or something along those lines. Basically eat some food so I can spend less money and not be still hungry afterwards. 	Drinking at a bar is a great time from a socialization aspect. You meet new people and can have fun conversations with these people. It's not just looking for a significant other. However from a frugal standpoint, I prefer to drink at home first to pregame and then go to the bar so I don't end up spending much at the bar. Doing that with friends you get the more intimate hanging with your friends at home and then you go out and socialize another way. It doesn't always have to be that way, sometimes it's more fun staying at home depending on the company and sometimes everyone just wants to go out instead of staying inside. 	Frugal	Frugal	1
465	"&gt;People don't want rural people free to shoot whoever got whatever reason.

That is an obvious strawman.

&gt;and people are basically mad that they can't shoot people who pose no danger to them, simply for being in their property. 

It is not ""simply being in their property"".

What you mean is, coming to their homes to steal from the homeowner. 

Farmers aren't saying they should be able to blow someone away who steps onto their property even if that person has peaceful intentions.

&gt;The cases in the news aren't home invasions. It's property theft, which is being escalated by farmers shooting at people.

Trespassing onto someone's home to steal from them is more serious than mere property theft like shoplifting or pickpocketing.

Perhaps you would be ok with people coming to your home to steal. But most rural people aren't, and rightly so.

470	"While I agree that Mozart and Picasso may have been greater artists, the problem is that you can never give a completely justified and grounded account of why what Footballers do can't be art (or artistic) compared to other artists. 

I mean, you can try, but you won't get anywhere. The most philosophically sound account is to simply recognize that we can't draw those lines, and that everything can be varying degrees of art. 

Henry?

I think he is one of those select footballers who stands out as a true artist. We call dancers artists, so why would the creative movements of Henry be any different? 

Another way to put it, is that I could imagine if Henry grew up with a paint and canvas, or a violin, or any other artistic tool, that he could have been one of those artists. Some people just have ""creative minds"", and it's only a matter of what their minds chose to focus on that determines what they master. Who knows what would happen if Henry never even picked up a football in his life?"	"I don't mean to simplify, but I do disagree to an extent. I agree in the past, and throughout history, it has been shown how complex money management can be. However, I think in this day and age, the resources and knowledge are simply too freely available: such that someone would have to go above and beyond irresponsibility to lose this kind of money. Yes, you guessed it, the internet is a huge part of that. 

In other words, i'm saying that just a few simple steps can ensure adequate management of the kind of wealth Coentrao has. 

Particularly now where the wealthy have seemingly been placed across a farther and farther gap relative to the poor and middle class. I.e. the age of the 1%; the have's and have nots. Just liquidating the kinds of property Coentrao owns already can likely ensure he never even enters middle class- let alone having to be ""poor"".

But anyways, you make a fair point, and I guess I shouldn't have been so extreme.

477	"A good rule of thumb is that almost no books that have been enormously popular and critically revered for decades are ""garbage."" "	"I would say you almost make my point for me. Styron is a miracle but he is also quite idiosyncratic and I could imagine many people, especially today, hating him; but no one could call Styron bad, because he isn't, he's an immortal master. I never tell anyone they have to like Shakespeare but no one can say that Shakespeare sucks. Kerouac isn't garbage, but he is ludicrously idiosyncratic and very easy to hate. In any case On the Road is like the intro class to Kerouac, if you hate it then you will truly loathe Visions of Cody, but Visions of Cody is a major accomplishment in American letters even if it is quite hard to like -- even for me, and I feel about Kerouac the way a lot of people feel about the Apostle Paul. And on the other hand I find Pynchon's books laughably unreadable, almost like a practical joke, but I'd never deny that he matters!

I agree with you that a momentary critical reaction is a bad judge. Everyone hated Moby Dick at the time even though it is the most important novel an American has ever written. And only a few years ago many critics compared the forgettable Art of Fielding to Moby Dick, even though I doubt anyone in the world will ever read Art of Fielding again.

507	Just becuase people have differing views of a subject doesnt make it subjective, if that were the case most all scientific inquiry would be 'subjective'	"&gt;Right, still not seeing the ""A and not A.""

Clarify please? I think i have something different in mind than what you think.

&gt;You are contradicting yourself - morally justifying an act as it coincides with some cultural framework IS an example of moralisze about some moral practices. It is exactly what gives us relativist the ability to say that what that other group does is plain wrong.

No, it doesn't. You can't assert that something is wrong if all of your justification is ""my culture says you're wrong"" becuase again, you have no moral basis to say you have any moral superiority. What puts your cultural view in a position to castigate abother cultural view?

&gt;Depends if the topic in question is relative or not. If a culture says slavery is moral then it is the case since morality is relative issue. If a culture says the Earth is flat then it is not the case since the shape of the Earth is not a relative issue.

Of course im talking about morality, so does the majority of a population hold the 'moral truth' of society?

&gt;For disclosure, I am a subjectivist, a subset of relativism. As such none of those potential issue applies to my stance.

508	"Concepts like this, as well as having been involved in a short term successful and long term unsuccessful counterinsurgency strategy, are why I've always been fond of the old canard that war is simply 'failed diplomacy'.

I blame TV and movies and the PR departments for military services. We've all imbibed at the teat the idea that a batallion of Marines and a Navy SEAL team can fix anything. 

Or, if you are are American, the myth that Vietnam could have been won if only the government had let the military do its job. False. The military was being asked to do a job it wasn't suited for, and that's why it failed. 

If your only problem is 'these easily identifiable dudes in particular, right now', then a military can solve your problem. Any problem that can be solved by killing or improved by killing more can be solved by a military.

Unfortunately, many problems humans face as a species are not amenable to killing. Very few problems are, actually. It is perhaps a consequence of our evolutionary history that we view killing as a viable strategy: the successful hammer that makes all else appear to be a nail.

And finally, no military can offer a long term solution for any non-defensive problem. Either a problem scales with killing or it doesn't. You can kill poachers, sure, but that doesn't fix why people become poachers. 

Last aside: people in developing countries are not stupid and often have a sense of the patiently historical that ought to shame us. They see the erratic way the Westerners dive into and out of projects in other countries on a whim, driven by fits of charitable giving, momentary national security interest, and moral panics.

They know they can just wait us out. So sure, you can deploy death squads (or 'disincentive squads') to Africa, but it is fairly likely the locals will stop poaching for as long as we make it difficult and resume it as soon as our money/interest/presence wanes.

The NFL is valued at over 62 billion dollars. The players are responsible for probably 95% of that revenue. More so, the stars of the league are responsible for even more of a share of that revenue. 

The franchise tag prevents stars of the league of getting their fair share of that revenue. They should be allowed to hit the open market and get paid what they're worth. I don't think demanding to get paid what your worth is greed at all. If anyone's being greedy, it's the owners imo.

557	"I read a ln economic breakdown of the tariff on Reuters, which is usually a pretty politically neutral source.  If I remember correctly, about 90% of the jobs in the solar industry in the US are installation and service.  10% of the industry will benefit from the tariff, while the other 90% get very badly harmed by it.


US solar panels have made a lot of progress in the past few years.  Until recently, Chinese solar panels were more efficient and cheaper than US made ones.  I think the US finally caught up on efficiency but still has trouble competing on price.  The tariffs take away the competitive motivation to innovate and improve on tech/cost savings.


In an energy market where cost is by far the most important factor, a rise in initial costs could be devastating to solar.  While the rest of the world improves their tech and installs a bunch of solar panels, the US will get left behind.  A few years from now we'll be trying to catch up."	"Even that 10% didn't really react positively to the tariff.  It seems like Trump thought he was doing solar a huge favor but never actually talked to any experts in the solar industry.


Personally, I think he's going to use the tariff as an excuse to get rid of solar subsidies.  His tax plan is creating a massive deficit, and he needs to find ways to bring in tax revenue and cut spending.  I think he initially wanted to get rid of the subsidies, then economists explained that would be an awful idea.  Now he can say that the subsidies aren't needed anymore because we are taxing foreign panels, so we don't need subsidies to compete.  His plan might be screwed though because he didn't understand that the subsidies and jobs are almost entirely in installation, and the negative reaction to the tariffs will make it hard to remove the subsidies."	technology	technology	1

Obviously if there's a wall on one side of the tracks, jumping to the other side is the better choice for avoiding an oncoming train.

But I'm not a huge fan of that metaphor, because it's an extreme example. Sure, if the Republican is a right-wing loon, incompetent white nationalist, it makes sense to vote against that bastard by voting for whoever has the best chance of beating them. But this is making an awful lot of assumptions about the contest.

It's not always such an obvious choice. Perhaps the Democrat has some special interests in their pocket that concern me, and the Republican is a reasonable person. I might still favor the Democrat's stated policies over the Republican's, but I am not necessarily convinced that they would be worth my vote. In this example, I can see far enough down the track to know that there's no train coming, and the Democrat is making no attempt to tell me why standing on their side of the track is in my best interest."

581	"""Dealing and selling of dangerous drugs should be a criminal act""

Currently we have many legal drugs that are very dangerous. Alcohol, tobacco, and even marijuana present many many risks to the user. These drugs are being regulated and sold by the government. All substances can be dangerous in some way or another, even water.

So you're saying that alcohol and tobacco should be illegal. Obviously this isn't going to happen as the majority of people would disagree to criminalizing it, even though it causes over 20x more deaths yearly vs most illegal drugs. 

For this reason we would be better off legalizing the drugs and helping people take them in a safer way. There's no negative effect from legalizing the drug. People won't stop using them even though they are illegal, as we can see, so we are better of regulating them and providing harm reduction practices for them to stay alive and safe.

""All supply routes of drugs that are illegal should be controlled by the government""

I agree, but this is not possible. If a drug is illegal people are gunna find a profit in prpducing it and selling it. The information on how to produce these drugs is to easily found. Anyone could produce heroin if they wanted to, which is why legalization would help. If you legalize a substance and regulate It, even maybe create facility's to administer it, you would be creating a safer way for users to have the correct doses, and eliminate the potential harms that the black market would bring such as lacing of other drugs and inaccurate doses. Users would rather know exactly what they are getting so they would always go to the regulated product over the black market.

"	"Everything is accurate in my post, you are just misinformed. Try overdosing by smoking heroin, you'll pass out way before you reach the ld50. Everything I've said about harm reduction being more available is true. Alcohol is a prime example of how we are able to use dangerous substances in a mostly safe way due to the regulations and harm reduction methods used. Both meth and heroin have been found to be safer than alcohol (a widely accepted drug) as shown here : https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm

Science cannot know about many aspects of the physical -- such as the origin of matter and energy, how life emerged from non life, the cause of the big bang, the cause of the cause of the big bang, and so on.

How can we not know about these aspects of the physical? We currently do not know, and that's great honestly because science doesn't make claims that it knows exactly how everything came to be. The ideas put forth by science are subject to change and revised. It's always changing based on the evidence we uncover, which is great. And what about those things we don't know? We say ""I don't know, let's try to find out."" If they can't find out, we are still left with I don't know. Which is better than making the claim that it was some supernatural being, just because we don't know.

&gt;At best scientists concoct various ""what may have happened"" theories. But atheists believe its all true, on the basis of faith -- even if they don't understand, for example, the complex equations used to ""prove"" the big bang.

I think the word you are looking for is hypothesis because a theory is the best explanation we can come up with given the evidence. It's not some guess that we make, and no we don't all believe these hypotheses to be true, especially on the basis of faith (however we'd have to define faith). We evaluate the evidence and see if it supports their claim. I'm not convinced that the big bang theory used an equation either. From what I've gathered, the background radiation leads to our universe starting with the big bang. Also, it's not like this stuff is only privy to scientists. You or I can look at the evidence ourselves to determine whether or now we should accept these claims. 

I also don't see why these objections to science pertain to the task at hand. How do we determine the supernatural? If we have no reliable way to determine if there is a supernatural, why should I accept the claims that there are?

600	"&gt;And unfortunately, I can certainly say that I would never trust any government, no matter its leadership or make-up, with that level of control over such an important issue.

You literally said you will never support gun control, because the government might take it too far; that's a slippery slope argument. If you can't even imagine a situation that you change your stance on, then you're not asking for a debate, you're asking to argue pointlessly. Fine.

What are you looking for me to say? That you're raising legitimate points? You are. Am I calling for a nationwide gun ban? No, because I'm not stupid. The US is obviously too large to adopt that method, and aside from that, no, the government shouldn't take everyone's guns. But the current system is not sustainable, and that price of freedom is too damn high. Which is why I am in favor of better gun control measures being worked out and discussed at both state and federal levels.

Specifically I'm in favor of making it more difficult to get a gun in the first place. That includes things like psychological screenings, which you've already addressed some legitimate points on. Banning all people with certain mental illnesses is no better than profiling, so it would need to be prevented, probably best by allowing an appeal/second opinion to be had, but that opens the door for messed up people to just see psychologist after psychologist until they get a green light, which is frankly too expensive for the common person, but not an abject impossibility. It's a pretty expensive loophole, but a loophole nonetheless. Honestly not sure how to fully prevent it. I guess I'll keep thinking.

Criminals being banned from legally obtaining weapons: convicted felons lose voting rights for 2 years after they are released. Maybe a similar system there? Voting is a fundamental right, just like the right to bear arms. Or maybe people just shouldn't commit crimes if they want to have all their rights? That's the exchange when they get sent to jail, so I'm pretty sure losing the right to a firearm is a reasonable punishment, for a variety of offenses. Not all of them, of course, but definitely a few. I can already hear ""but what about the wrongfully convicted"", well then we should also be calling for reform to the judicial system, but that's a different issue that isn't even remotely able to be addressed through gun control.

Criminals illegally obtaining guns/Usage of miscellaneous weapons: that's part of why controls need to be implemented - to prevent more guns from being out there to be obtained by illegal means. This is particularly important regarding gangs, like you said. And even if we can prevent the gangs from getting guns, what's to stop them from using a machete, or a baseball bat? But then again, everyday people commit murder with miscellaneous objects or even their bare hands. If a gang wants to hurt you, then a gang is probably going to hurt you. So gun control won't impact gang violence too much. But it does prevent OVERALL gun violence, which is the point; you can't just say it doesn't solve this one problem and therefore any and all benefits of policy are moot. 

As for implementing better training as you've suggested, that'll be great for anyone who owns a gun and happens to be at the scene when something does go wrong. It's a situation that's happened before and is a legitimate to defend as a possible resolution to catastrophes. In that same vein, though, there are plenty of times when having a gun doesn't/wouldn't help a victim. Like Las Vegas, where there was no way for any of those victims to retaliate against the shooter. To be clear, I'm not against required training since it should also help prevent accidents involving guns in addition to being a great addition to the situations I mentioned above, but it's not a preventative measure against intentional misuse of a firearm.

Also I want to bring up a few additional points you mention:

&gt;There is no fucking up with this. There is no ‘well, shit, sorry we didn’t see that one coming’ and just hoping the mass societal issue a policy could generate will be ‘solved over time’

So without gun control, hundreds and hundreds of civilian deaths are the price of freedom, but with gun control the possible policy flaws are unforgivable sins?

&gt;The purpose of having a representative government rather than a direct democracy is because we need to have thought-out, reasonable, objectively considered, and debated legislation.

Yet you don't trust those same representatives to maintain your rights once even minor restrictions are in place. 

&gt;Once this threshold is crossed, there won’t be any going back, government never cede that level of legal precedent when it comes to political control. 

You're simultaneously saying that confiscation and a nationwide ban are both impossible to implement and the only logical outcome. You also say that revolution is a point of great concern regarding the right to bear arms. It's what the second amendment was for, right? Then shouldn't you be revolting against the government if they do cross the line? It's the price of freedom.

&gt; So yes, it better be the best, most thought out policy there is, because this is a serious issue we cannot afford to misstep on.

Awesome, I'm not saying it shouldn't be thought out for a long time, hence my call for everyone to be part of the process instead of being like you and trying to prevent the process from happening at all.

Take abortion as an example. It is clearly not allowed, under most circumstances, in most monotheistic religions. However, if we take countries like the UK and USA, most of the people do not subscribe to those specific teachings (ie even if they are Christian by name they don’t necessarily believe in those teachings). Therefore having a law that bans abortion because of your religion teachings is inconsistent with the views and beliefs of most other people in the country, and refuses rights to people just because they aren’t of a particular religion.

A strange phrase.  In any case, most people don't ""smoke responsibly"".

***""The FTC's lawsuit in US District Court in San Francisco alleges that AT&amp;T hit unlimited data customers with an ""unfair mobile data throttling program"" and that AT&amp;T committed a ""deceptive failure to disclose [the] mobile data throttling program.""""***



I'm not pissed at you at all. Just not sure why you aren't understanding that they are not appealing the fact they did it.

They are literally appealing being punished for what they did.

They admit they did it. They admit they got caught. They admit they changed their paperwork and advertising immediately afterwords. They sold 30gb data plans while throttling unlimited at 5gb.

They just think the FTC can't fine them for lying to start with. 

They also tried to get out of it by claiming that press release you linked about the top 5% meant they could throttle anyone, anytime at any data amount they wanted.

Verizon in fact pulled the exact same thing but had little ***** in the smallest possible font to let you know about limits and speeds.

Simple enough?"	"Edit: to be clear at&amp;t got in trouble for 3 and 5gb caps. Enjoy your unlimited 3gb plan... I had a Verizon unlimited when they did same thing.

See a bit of difference there?

I suppose they could push towards T-Mobile too but between the 50gb data cap now and the zero rating for audio and video I don't think that many T-Mobile users are getting annoyed by throttling. Even back In the lower cap days they phrased the ads to read more asking the lines of, 10gb high speed with unlimited 2g data rather than just Unlimited Data Woooo!!! *******not really written in 2pt font on 12 foot sign*******

Was T-Mobile customer until had other issues with them. Really really really really hard too come anywhere near hitting the throttling limit.

609	Also look at the Southern Baptists and their quest to convert all Jews to Christianity. (I'm Jewish and have had people try to convert me because they couldn't accept that I don't worship Jesus.)	"There's a plan by extremist Christians to make everyone follow Christianity. They keep pushing for ""Christian laws"" - everything from Christian prayers in schools to teaching Christian creationism as an ""alternative"" to evolution to insisting that all politicians making the laws need to follow the Christian Bible. Anyone who isn't Christian might not be forced to convert (at first), but they will be forced to abide by Christian laws or else.

Most of these groups also take the view that the end times are approaching and to hasten it Israel must be controlled by the Jewish people. This lets them appear to be friendly to Jews, but the second part of their apocalypse fantasy requires all Jews (like me) to convert to Christianity. Groups with significant political power like the Southern Baptists have made it their mission to convert all Jews to Christianity. They've even formed groups to trick Jews into converting. (Jews For Jesus - which was formed when they realized people didn't convert upon being threatened with hell.)

I've experienced this first hand when an older couple tried to convince me and my family that we could worship Jesus and still be Jewish. When I refused, they kept pressuring us to convert.

There are a lot of similarities between extremist Islamic beliefs and extremist Christian. Just replace ""Allah"" with ""Jesus."""	politics	politics	1

I'm thinking it will simplify my tax filings - set up IUP to automatically charge my business Amex every month, and then instead of having to do the depreciation sheet on each return I can just itemize those specific payments on the return of the year in which they occur and be done with it.  That's one of the reasons businesses like leases so much - they really streamline the accounting.  I have another business for which I expect to be buying a bunch of Xs's and Xr's, and I'm definitely planning to finance them all with the IUP, provided I'm able to get it approved in the corporation's name (new company, no established credit).  	True... but also, raising the per unit price for premium customers will offset lower volume, or could if it hypothetically went that way.

I doubt she forgot you and it has nothing to do with your value as an individual — it has to do with the fact that she wasn’t happy and has found a way, in her view, to be happy. It sucks to be the person who was “left behind” but just remember that her actions have nothing to do with you.

633	"O-rings (and elastomeric seals in general) made stuffing boxes mostly obsolete but packing is still used in boats and on the most extreme-duty hydraulics.  

Packing is way bigger than seals are, which means it's bulky and expensive but also that it's extremely resistant to ingress.  The sealing is pretty distributed over a large area so if grit gets in, it doesn't get pressed very hard into the shaft.  The packing can also compensate for wear for a long time since it is constantly pushed tighter and tighter against the shaft.  

Elastomer seals also require really high quality polishes on the shaft.  They aren't great at handling pits or scratches since the sealing area is fairly small.  This is a problem when it's impractical to refinish the shaft- like the 3' main shaft in a cargo ship.  Also, stuffing can sometimes be applied around a shaft rather than from the end.

Ultimately, the bottleneck again comes down to post-med-school education funding, and it's the funding there that really causes the problems.  Sure, you could open a thousand new medical schools, but that's just 100,000-200,000 new graduates who will be severely in debt and unable to practice medicine whatsoever because simply graduating medical school isn't enough anymore.

While it may be partially true (I don't even know to be honest), chalking it up solely to ""doctors and the AMA aren't lobbying hard enough"" takes the lion's share of due blame away from society at large and our lax attitudes towards research and education.  Legislators aren't elected by lobbyists, they're elected by voters.  If more people cared about education funding, more legislators would as well, and more funding would get passed.  

And you might be surprised how many current practicing physicians don't like working in a failing, overworked, and overburdened health care system, and would gladly take a paycut to make their lives and their patients' lives better.

652	"Very long time raid/guild leader, from their inception into GW2

Here are a few questions:

how do you deal with always one or two member missing on a scheduled raid night ? Do you have more than ten members and you have them sit out ? If you do that, do you see members dropping out of the guild ?

- Typically yes on the extra members. There are static slots and there are swing slots, often called ""+1"". If a static member cant make it, they should generally let you know ahead of time if literally at all possible (this isnt raid etiquette, this is life etiquette) which gives you a chance to go down your list of preferred stand-ins and fill the slot. If literally nobody is available, grab a Pug and hope for the best. I personally have not seen anyone drop the guild due to this. 

how have you recruited people so that they stay together and keep playing together ?

Start with friends and players you already know, who are going to hang out regardless of the raid status. After that, my personal strategy for recruitment is  a reference to the previous point; those Pugs you pick up now and then? Make an offer to the chill ones that contribute well - they'd probably love to stop pugging so often.

how have you overcome burn outs from certain members ?

This is what swings/+1's are for. If someone gets burnt out to the degree that they have literally no interest in raiding anymore, even just logging on once a week for a couple hours, there's nothing you as a leader can do about it. have a conversation with them, let them know in friendly but certain terms that if its going to be a long-term thing you need to offer the main slot to someone else. That said, I have a lot of +1's that are only fine being +1's and dont WANT a static committed slot, so I've subbed people for 2-3 weeks before and then had them come back in once their IRL business was handled.

raids can get frustrating, how have you dealt with toxicity, fights, arguments ?

- A good idea here is to start with people who arent natively toxic. If you start with inherently toxic people, you're going to have a bad time. Once past that, dont slam your head on something over and over again unless its for progression. Set a pull limit (say 5 attempts at a boss) before just shrugging and moving on to the next wing, unless its your last thing for the night. Never make this a big deal, teach dont berate, everyone has off nights. Try to end on a good note, even if you've been wiping on your 5th boss for an hour, by pointing out what went well and highlight progress made throughout the night. Did you go from consistently dying at 80% to consistently dying at 50%? that's good work, that's progress.

As for fights and toxicity, maybe I'm a little unorthodox in this, but... this is your team and your guild. You make the calls and decisions, and any input you seek is simply in the form of advise or opinion seeking - the say is yours. This is not in any way a democracy, and as long as you treat people like civil adults, they can agree or disagree with you all they want as long as they do it.

what would you say are the main tips to maintain a successful raid group ?

1) start with chill people who you know. A chill baseline will do you wonders in the long-term
2) be civil, even when you want to strangle the shit out of someone
3) dont call people out. If someone is fucking up repeatedly, whisper them and explain what's killing them or how they can do a thing better. If needed, swap the roles out.
4) be consistent
5) Teach, dont berate
6) get yoself a discord. Shit's free, and its a great way to stay high on communication."	"T3 always has issues.

Traumatizing men is perfectly acceptable. Traumatizing women (who got to prison by traumatizing others) is not acceptable because...women are equal to men?

&gt;“Prison is not where women need to be,” said Benedict, a partner on the National Resource Center on Justice Involved Women, funded by the U.S. Department of Justice. “Even if prisons were highly functional places, they don’t belong there. It’s a train wreck, to be honest, a train wreck.”

If women commit felonies, then prison is exactly where they need to be. As a matter of fact, women commit felonies and gynocentric judges and prosecutors often REFUSE to send them to prison.

&gt;Margaret Byrne, an attorney who for 35 years has represented countless women who fought back against abusers, agreed. Many women call 911 to report the violent crime they’ve just committed on a partner, Byrne said, but they fail at proving the difficult self-defense theory in court.

Probably because you can't 'self-defense' a man while he's sleeping, or when his back is turned, or when he's not presenting an immediate and credible threat.

&gt;The assertion from forces against Brett M. Kavanaugh that false allegations of rape or attempted rape are extremely rare is rebutted by a number of studies, researchers say.

Shark attacks are rare too, but I bet if someone sees a dorsal fin in the water, you'll hustle your ass up to the beach, won't you?

Brent E. Turvey, a criminologist, wrote a 2017 book that dispels this notion. His research, and that of two co-authors, cited statistical studies and police crime reports. One academic study showed that as many as 40 percent of sexual assault charges are false. Mr. Turvey wrote that the FBI in the 1990s pegged the falsity rate at 8 percent for rape or attempted rape complaints.

&gt;“There is no shortage of politicians, victims’ advocates and news articles claiming that the nationwide false report for rape and sexual assault is almost nonexistent, presenting a figure of around 2 percent,” writes Mr. Turvey, who directs the Forensic Criminology Institute. “This figure is not only inaccurate, but also it has no basis in reality. Reporting it publicly as a valid frequency rate with any empirical basis is either scientifically negligent or fraudulent.”

&gt;A recent study supports this assessment. The Pentagon issues an annual report on sexual assaults in the military. **Nearly one-quarter of all cases last year were thrown out for lack of evidence**, according to a report released in May.

And the feminist ideologues will assert that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, while demanding that you draw an assumption solely because it favors their narrative, rather than based on the weight of the evidence...which is absent.

&gt;“It appears that die-hard opponents of Kavanaugh have invented a narrative to imply that false accusations hardly ever happen,” said Elaine Donnelly, who directs the Center for Military Readiness.

Remember back in the Duke Lacrosse days when their narrative was ""Why would a woman EVER lie about rape?""

&gt;Women’s advocates say that an unfounded case doesn’t necessarily mean the accuser was lying.

What did I just write?

&gt;The National Sexual Violence Resource Center puts the false report rate at 2 percent to 10 percent.

&gt;“Research shows that rates of false reporting are frequently inflated, in part because of inconsistent definitions and protocols, or a weak understanding of sexual assault,” the center said.

Translation from bullshit-to-English: Assume in favor of our narrative; ignore any lack of evidence.

Why would a woman ever lie about rape? Why would we ever lie to you about the frequency of rape?

Same snake oil in a new bottle.

&gt;Mr. Turvey quotes a study by researcher Edward Greer, past president of the Association American Law Schools. He traced the one and only source for the “2 percent” assertion to a 1975 book, **“Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape,”** which quoted statistics from New York City, not from across the nation.

Written by Susan Brownmiller, who in the same book, implicitly justified the murder of Emmett Till for the false accusation of whistling at Carolyn Bryant, who got her White Knight hubby Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam to torture Till, shoot him, and then dump his body in a river.

 #BelieveWomen

&gt;Mr. Turvey cites 10 studies that debunk the 2 percent assertion in the U.S. and abroad.

&gt;“The power of any lie is equal only to our desire to believe it,” Mr. Turvey wrote. “Specifically, our need and eagerness to believe it. This is the problem with belief — which is accepting something as true or correct without proof.”

Feminism is an identitarian cult and more men are slowly waking up to that fact because Feminists are hell bent on serving up proof of it every day."	MensRights	MensRights	1

I may be wrong, so don’t take this personally. but it seems you think that because/if she lied about the reason she’s not interested, that there’s less of a reason to take her disinterest seriously. The reason why isn’t that important because whatever it really is she’s still not interested. 

Pursuing someone who says they’re not interested and is trying to avoid talking to you is probably an asshole move.

679	"Going exclusive with EA doesn't necessarily mean less sales though. For example, if the NFL gave out their license to anybody willing to make an NFL game, would it mean a significant increase in sales of NFL games? I think the likely case is that the sales would simply split.

Star Wars is different because there's a higher likelihood of fans buying multiple games. Still, how many Star Wars games does Disney want to make? Unless it's a really large number, EA should be capable of developing a reasonable amount of Star Wars games. Again, they aren't necessarily selling less. At the very least it's not guaranteed.

Going exclusive with Xbox/Windows 10 is different. It's an absolute guarantee that sales would drop without Playstation. Unless Xbox takes over the market to the extent that lost Playstation sales don't matter. And that would take many years, if it ever happens.

And another point. These companies want to fans to have access to their products. They want their fans to be happy. Partnering with EA has allowed them to do that because EA develops AAA games for every platform people expect to be able to play those games. If they go exclusive to Xbox/Windows 10 then suddenly Star Wars, NFL, and FIFA fans with just a PS4 (a large amount of people) would be pissed. These companies usually try to avoid pissing off fans.

It simply doesn't make sense for these companies to give exclusive rights to EA if Microsoft buys them. I doubt any of them would have made their deals with EA if they were owned by Microsoft and only making Xbox/Windows 10 exclusives. Just like I would never expect any of them to give exclusive rights to Sony or Nintendo."

Another part would have to be that if you delete your primary then the second save moves up to primary. That way you can't just play on the second and continuously delete your primary. Convoluted, I know =\

690	"&gt; Things that might otherwise stigmatize and isolate people have become points of connection online.

Right, but who is to say every point of connection is a positive influence? There's a reason this post contained the disclaimer:

&gt;WARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide

Pre-2000s maybe we looked around and thought, *everyone around me seems less down than I am in general, I should figure out what is going on and try to work out of this funk...*


But then you got on 4chan the first time and discovered that there's an epidemic. Now maybe there's less motivation to work on the issues leading to ideation/depression because previously they seemed like barriers to connection but in a digital setting everything no matter how grim or bad is a means of connecting with others. 


If you feel isolated, maybe the internet is an enabler. Maybe someone who is depressed and seeking human connection cannot bring themselves to work on the one thing that allows them to keep connecting with others (so they think), suicidal depression. So instead of thinking of it as an illness, it becomes an identity.


That is the premise of my question, maybe using technology to connect humanity absolutely to whatever end is not a good thing. Maybe we need to become aware that just because you are one way and can find others that are the same way, does not make it healthy to be hate posting over at /r/The_Donald or /b/ while loathing in suicidal depression. That's all technically what you are describing, connecting with others, but without the things that traditionally govern healthy interaction such as social normative behavior, cultural values, empathy etc. all of that gets removed online and re-created via systems like Reddit's mod/karma system, but its far from human...

I am going to argue fervently that in the general case of connected technology the end did not justify the means. For every positive interaction via the internet there are a dozen that are purely cancerous. And I think the socio-political climate in America repute with hate speech, racist political leadership, fake news etc. is the case study, enabled at least in part, by facilitating and empowering the wrong types of connections. Another case in point is the flat earth/anti-vax movements. Those are only possible via connected technology that allow disparate collections of mental illness to self-validate and organize.


"	"&gt;I mean the internet is probably the only reason I'm still alive. 

Some people say that about alcohol, but it can still ruin your life.


I really doubt the internet is the only reason you are still alive, but it makes sense that the internet would convince you of something like this.


The best solution in this scenario is to get off 4Chan/Reddit/RuneScape, no more /b/. Then identify some areas that provide a basis for social interaction like joining a gym or some kind of hobby group like an archery class, whatever you're interested in as long as it gets you out of the house. Then you meet some people here and there, maybe you invite people from work, once that door is open you'll find it gets a lot easier.


Whatever you choose to do with your life don't make the mistake of assuming the internet is ""good"" just because it allows you to relate to similar people. You can get hundreds of up-votes with self-deprecating posts on Reddit/4Chan but at the end of the day that does nothing for anyone. I would argue its actually harmful because it allows a degree of complacency by allowing a person to feel like its ok to be depressed since lots of other people are depressed on the internet and they are upvoting me.

The big one that comes to mind is the Assyrians (Church of the East) who are Syriac. Some Eastern Catholics are also Syriac (Maronites). There's a number of Indian churches that fall into these weird categories with the Orientals or other Eastern communions.    
   
Communion in the Middle East and Africa is a mess tbh"	"Except this is exactly what you're doing. I didn't state that arguments for papal *primacy* didn't exist until the 19th century. I said that infallibility wasn't a thing until then. Popes throughout history have tried claiming some form of supremacy over the Church, and have always been shut down by the rest of the patriarchs. But the egotism of Rome leads them to profess that it magically wasn't the other 4 patriarchates who were right, but rather the one man standing on a hill shouting for power...while ironically claiming to be ""Catholic"". Somehow the entire Catholic church, even the monophysites, have NEVER accepted any of the current claims of Rome, but were to believe the claims of this one bishop over the rest of Christendom......wow.   
St Pope Gregory had some choice words about anyone who tried to do just that.            
     
There isn't a single piece of actually evidence to support any of your claims. Claiming things requires proof. You can say until you're blue in the face that the pope had special powers (to ratify councils lmao) but there isn't any evidence to even begin to show that. Leo didn't even attend Chalcedon, but were supposed to believe it wasn't authoratitave without him...because that makes sense. He's so powerful and important, yet can't be bothered to even show up despite bishops from all around the known world were attending. Just like every single other council. The irony of bringing up Chalcedon is that the emperor refused to even hear Leo. Leo had been asking for a council to be called for years but kept getting told ""no"" by Theodosius II.  
Some universal and supreme pope, amirite.    
And I guess that means that all the declarations that affirmed and ratified contract at subsequent councils we're just all the other bishops pretending to be little popes themselves.    
   
Councils were held that specifically dealt with the problems developing in Rome (Quinisext, Eighth Ecumenical Council) but rather than having humility and accepting that the declarations of THE ENTIRE CHURCH outside of Rome *might* have some weight, Rome would rather stick their fingers in their ears and shout ""nope"" while claiming to be heroic. You don't just get to do whatever you want and claim to be correct.

First things first... your level and gear doenst matter in PvP. They only matter for PvE and WvW.

&gt; Keep leveling the 47 thief or continue on mesmer and why?

Since at the moment you dont enjoy thief spend your time on your mesmer. A game should be fun and you should do whatever you enjoy right now. If later o you want to go back to your thief you can do so freely and maybe by that time you will have 33 tomes from PvP that you can use to instantly level to 80.

However I don't suggest you use the boost right now for the same reasons that others have mentioned."	"&gt;  the tomes would be for nothing in the other pvp terms

I m not sure i understand what you mean here. Sorry.

&gt;  every site and person says deadeye is weak in pvp

Core thief is great for pvp though. I remember that Sindrener (one of the top Thieves) was recently using Core thief in tournaments. As far as I know, some people prefer to use core thief instead of daredevil (the HoT specialisation) because core Sword+dagger thief has better teamfight potential than the dagger+pistol daredevil.

Do you have any plans on buying Heart of Thorns?

It seems to me that you are mostly focused on PvP and WvW. If that is the case then go and play PvP with any class you want untill you find something that you really like. Then you can decide if you want to use the boost or not and if you want to level your thief or if you prefer to play some other class. You have nothing to lose.

Finally in another post you said:
&gt; i dont want to learn the thief and get used to its abilities if im going to quit it at 80 anyway. I feel no need to farm and get hearts anymore if i anyway quit the thief. I am learning the thief and getting used to its abilities which will bother me when i start a new character.

Leveling a thief is great for 1 thing: you have to learn to dodge, because the thief is the less forgiving class in that regard.

Since you want to pvp and be competitive I would suggest you keep leveling your thief and practice dodging, get used to it and make it a habit to dodge when needed. Train your muscle memory so that dont have to think to dodge, but you do it out of reflex. 

Getting used to thief will not bother you when you start a new character. If you know how to play a thief then it means you know how to kill a thief and you know how a thief can kill you. This will help a lot if you want to be good in PvP.

However, I've heard from others that a big breakfast is important and should not be skipped. Especially if you front load your day with highly cognitively demanding work. The stressed brain will encourage insulin production and take all the blood sugar out of your system and make you anxious.

What do you guys think?"	This is what I am beginning to discover.. and it wipes me out for the rest of the day. I do not regain my focus after I eat. I wonder how much of it is habit	Fitness	Fitness	1
746	"That isn't about ""whataboutism."" You're cognitively deficient. That's okay. I'll help explain it to you, since you need extra help.

If someone is making a claim, and you know from past experience they are a liar and have made lies to support some action they wished to take, that's valuable and relevant information. That's why I pointed out how these countries have, in the past, lied to support their actions. They get away with it, so there's no reason not to continue.

So I ask, knowing that these people aren't trustworthy, based on their own actions, what was the evidence that caused you to believe this was Russia? If it's simply ""well, they said it was them."" I'd argue, how can you trust them? I don't. 

They haven't caught the people responsible. They don't know who did it. That's the truth."	"&gt; In your country, are you required to ask a foreign nations government for these building permits? When you request these permits are they denied 95% of the time?

748	"Man, you people are simple minded.

Countries with a negative growth rate are more highly correlated with bad economies than countries with positive growth rates. As economies get more developed, the growth rate falls. This is a fact.

Immigration is one of the main ways to stem the tide of a falling growth rate. That is also a fact.

You do not want to be a country with a falling population growth. Before anyone says it - Japan is a country on the verge of a population crisis right now due to its aging population and unwillingness to embrace immigration. Guess who is more of a drain on the social safety net, a 80 year old senior citizen or a 35 year old immigrant working at McDonald's. Japan is at a point where there are more people over the age of 60 than there are 30 and under. Guess what happens if the population of people on social security outnumbers the population of working people. "	"Don't put words in my mouth.

749	What nonsense, a massive amount of R&amp;D is done by the public healthcare agencies of the world. The US isn't the sole arbiter of medical research.	"The EU contains four of the top ten military powers in the world - France, Britain, Germany, and Italy. Not to mention Poland, whose army is no small token either. Together they have several supercarriers, a large and well-trained/equipped army, a gigantic industrial base, and some of the most advanced military technology in the world. There are also two nuclear powers, the UK and France, who both hold enough of an arsenal to dissuade any aggressor state. 

The combined might of those forces would crush Russia in a war. There's no question about it - the Russian military still largely uses Soviet era equipment, Russia's economy is about the same size as Italy's, and their status as a power is only diminishing these days, despite their uncanny knack for projecting power far beyond what other nations of their magnitude are capable of. Maybe 30 years ago the US was the main thing stopping Europe from being dominated by Russia, a superpower at the time, but not anymore - the EU is more than capable of standing on its own two feet these days. 

The notion that America alone guards Europe is a lie propagated by those with an interest in keeping the US military-industrial complex as bloated and parasitic as it already is; if America reduced its military spending to a more sensible proportion of its budget then maybe things which the rest of the first world have, like public healthcare and decent worker's rights, would start looking more affordable."	news	news	1

&gt; The story of how charr tribune Rytlock Brimstone became the first revenant hasn’t yet been told, but at the launch of Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns, he’ll have brought the knowledge of how to obtain that power to the world of Tyria, making it somewhat common knowledge.  

To me it would've been cleaner lorewise if Rytlock had instead been the first *herald*. The writers could've just retroactively explained that revenants always existed in Tyria in some form but were rare, which is why we never met them in core Tyria before HoT (unless we count the player character becoming one of them in core storyline retroactively).

And even if our heroes were aware of revenants to some extent, Rox's comment mentioning Rytlock's new abilities would still work under this scenario as Rytlock notably used the Legendary Dragon Stance of a herald in the cutscene depicting his return from the Mists."	Yes, Domain of the Lost is part of the Underworld (Grenth's realm) which exists in the Mists.

797	"My view is that Christian are no long bound by the civil and ceremonial law of the Jews, but we are still bound by the moral laws of which the 10 commandments are part.  But we all know we are incapable of fulfilling even all of that and this is where Jesus is significant.  By accepting Him as our savior and believing God raised Him from the dead, we are saved.  In being saved, we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit which dwells within and begins changing us into better people - which is the born again part.  We grow in spiritual maturity and outwardly, our behavior will change with the fruits of the spirit which are love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.  Being a Christian and getting better is a process and we will never perfect it, but with the help of the Holy Spirit, we will improve.

There is also a difference in what saves us as Christians vs what saved Jews.  To be made righteous under the law, a person had to not break any of the moral law.  If they did, they had to offer a sacrifice to atone for the laws they broke.  Jesus was the last sacrifice and all who believe in Him receive His righteousness.

A minister who I have great respect for once said, ""you are saved, not because you do good works, but you do good works because you are saved.""

The civil law goes away because those were laws to govern the country of Israel and Christianity is given to all nations, not just the Jews.  The ceremonial laws go away because Jesus was critical of the Jewish leaders for following ceremony with intense rigor, but with no real love of God behind them.  He denounced tradition and ceremony as voiding the word of God.

The character of God from the Gen to Rev is all about loving Him and He loving us.  To recognize that with Him, we can accomplish anything, but without Him we were limited.  He expressed the desire to have a relationship with Him as a two way street...move closer to God and God will move closer to you.

Ugh, this question is so good and such a challenge. I think it depends on the location and resources available to the person stuck in the culture. In the US, there are plenty of programs that can assist people to leave these situations (if they want) or figure out how to change them/cope with them. If  the person is stuck in a location without resources and/or not willing or able to leave, then an option is to work at re-interpreting the abusive treatment. In other words, for the abused person to learn how to avoid taking on any ideas about ""deserving"" the beating or scolding. For the abused person to figure out how to work within the abusive system they are stuck in but not allow the abuse to take control of their mind and interpretations of self or situation. A great book (IMO) that comes to mind about this concept is Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning.

I think this question makes a lot of sense. I don't prescribe medications and am not a doctor, but I collaborate with those who do. Not all medications work for all people, and there are an increasing number of prescribers who will run a DNA panel to identify which medications are best matched for a person's particular chemical makeup. I have seen that make a significant difference. Also, the FDA requires clinical trials to show efficacy before they will allow a drug co to tout that X medication will do Y for you. That being said, the placebo affect is real, and even if that's all that's at play... it's still a win IMO that the person is feeling better. Research indicates that therapy + meds is the most effective for most people though, rather than meds alone. "	IAmA	IAmA	1

For the record, *I am* a theoretical physicist, and I encounter very very few people who have much of any interest in the octonions, if they know about them at all (in any case, the work of the linked article was only published after Pratchett's death, and most of the prior interest regarding octonions in physics comes from superstring theory, which was not invented until after ""The Colour of Magic"" was written). Yes, octonions are not new, but they *are* very niche. They aren't commonly talked about, even among mathematicians and physicists. They're certainly not things you'd ever come across in studying the physics of nuclear power plants."	"I admittedly have not read ""The Colour of Magic"", but from some googling, I do not see any apparent relation between octonions and how Pratchett uses the number eight. Saying ""we need to figure out how he invented a physics use for octonions before physicists did"" is like saying ""we need to figure out how the number 8 became important in Chinese culture before mathematicians invented the octonions"". Simply inventing the colour octrine and the substance octiron is not indicative that Pratchett was influenced by octonions (again, I have not read the book, so this is just my impression from a quick googling). There is much more to octonions than the number eight. It seems more likely, as another user pointed out, that Pratchett gave the number 8 mystical connotations as a twist on how European culture traditionally thought the number 7 to be magical."	books	books	1

Also contributing to Western thought, in ancient times and then in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance onwards, a tradition of rationalism in various spheres of life, developed by Hellenistic philosophy, Scholasticism, humanism, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.

Values of Western culture have, throughout history, been derived from political thought, widespread employment of rational argument favouring freethought, assimilation of human rights, the need for equality, and democracy.

An isolated occurrence of something doesn't make its representation in the game ""non-historical"" so spare me your anecdotes and Wiki articles of bagpipe players and katana wielding allied soliders leaping into war and the women that constituted 0.1%  of soldiers.  But I don't play BF for the historical accuracy so I personally don't care. 

&gt;Now I have to ask: so what?

All I said was that it's reasonable for people to complain and I'm not going to jump  to the sexist label. I didn't realize that's such a radical statement. 

You just admitted people have different expectations; that's why people are complaining. I'm not really sure of the point you're trying to make. 

&gt;Your question is rhetorical

My question was not rhetorical. Another user claimed that Fornite had a wildly less sexist playerbase so that's why there were fewer complaints about female characters. I felt that is simply ridiculous and it was due to the expectations of the game, which is why I asked you. 

"	"They are similar enough topics that the point still stands:

&gt;Why is it such a problem for people to accept inaccuracies for better gameplay, but still want to play as realistic characters?

Why does no one complain about women characters in Fornite? Is the Forntnite player base wildly less sexist? Or are there different expectations for a WW2 game?

835	Belief in a Creator is actually something anyone can have.  People who wish to find evidence will know it as they look around them.  Faith is another thing.  For example, in Chrsitianity, faith in God means beleiving not merely that he exists (the starry skies and one's sense of the numinous can do that) but what he has spoken in revelation and his redemptive purpose  in Christ.  Pascal proposed his famous wager because even in his day, knwoledge seemed bifurcated.  Aquinas introduced a synthesis but the material world was starting to 'eat up' the upper-story world of revelation, making it seem mystical and less reasonable than before.  (Remember the difference between Plato and Aristotle).  It seemed at least for some that a leap was required.  I think that whether we live in times when faith is a plausible assumption or in times when it's not, faith in the God of the Judeo-Christian account is something we will always need.  We will always view the world through our worldview.  We will always screen some things out and take in others.  And revelation entails things for which we do not have evidence per se, at least not at this historical juncture.  	I believe we need to find out what we can.  We will never know the world in its entirety, but we can know some things with a relative degree of certainty.  If we rely on what we think 'works' we will never know what is true.  Many things seem to work but are nonetheless false.  The truth, on the other hand, may not always seem to work in the short-term, though I believe time will ultimately vindicate it.  For these reasons, I never believe things based on results.	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

I, for instance simply can't afford to buy into a master set draft, but I could do a $4 set draft more easily which would effect how I view a set.

We can look, for instance, at UN-sets where the value doesn't add up most of the time, but the lower price allows for more people to draft it.

I'm not sure if I answered your question, but I do think MSRP is definitely relevant to these discussions.

Static stretching BEFORE the activity [reduces](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/777155) performance.

I'm a physio student, and the only purpose of stretching a muscle is to increase it's length, this is only needed if it's shortened, and even then, it's really really hard to increase the length of a muscle with just stretching.

If you have a shortened pectoralis minor/major, static stretching won't do shit if you still bench press in a non- full ROM fashion.

If you workout, and you do every movement in it's full range of motion, and work the agonist/antagonist with the same ratio (assuming you never had imbalances before you started working out) there would ideally be no need to stretch at all.

But I do understand that it’s all down to efficiency of a kind.   The headline gets slapped on by an overworked intern who, due to time constraints, likely hasn’t read the whole piece.  That’s why I always wrote my own whenever I published a piece.  They tended to be longer, but they were more accurate!

Now if you really have a philosophical disagreement with the substance of the story, I’d advise you to comment on the story on NPR’s site.  Provide your reasons for your concerns and there’s a good chance someone will address them.  If you’re REALLY concerned, then write their ombudsman, and she’ll get back with you.  

I guess what I’m saying is that this fits with that corollary to Occam’s Razor,  “Never attribute to malice what can best be explained by incompetence.”  I don’t think this is a case of incompetence myself, but my experience with the folks at NPR is that they are, at the end of the day, fallible people like you and me who are doing a very hard job in a system with a lot of moving parts.

866	"Only this is the fact. The manager NEVER asked them to leave. 

It would be like you sitting down in a restaurant waiting for a guest who said they would meet you in 20 minutes. The waitress comes by and asked for your order.  You say I'm not ready to order because I'm waiting for someone. The waitress walks away, tells the manager, and manager calls the police without ever coming to your table. 

You are patiently waiting for you friend, when two armed officers come to the table and ask you to leave. You question, why? They say because the manager says you have to go. You asked, ""What have I done.?"" 

They say, ""You have to leave because you have not made a purchase.""

You say, ""I'm waiting for a friend.""

They say, ""You still have to leave. Pick up your belongings and leave.""

There are at least five or six other people in the restaurant who have not ordered because they are waiting for a friend, waiting for their spouse to park the car, waiting for a date to get out of the restroom \(any host of reasons\), but you are singled out.  

You find this absurd and you try to reason with the police. They ask you, in the course of the dialogue, to leave three times. You cannot believe you are being treated this way. Then the police handcuff you and place you under arrest because they have asked you three times to leave. 

As you are walking out, the person you were meeting shows up and asks, ""What is going on?""

You try to explain, but the police still usher you out and take you to jail. 

This is similar to what happened to them. The only difference being, they were singled out because they were black and unlike a restaurant, Starbucks has no written policy that says you have to make a purchase in order to sit in their establishment or use their facilities.

The word ""Stormtrooper"" even comes from a very specific specialist soldiers unit within the German army during World War 1. The way the Stormtroopers march were also inspired by the way the Nazis marched in old historical footage. It's all German based.

On top of the name having a German connection with his name, Vader's appearance (specifically his helmet) was inspired by the ancient Japanese samurai's helmets which had a similar shape to them.

"&gt;  The problem with things like what the article is describing is not that people shouldn't talk about these things, but instead with offering the same tired old explanation without evidence that the status quo is simply correct because the status quo arose due to natural factors.

But people are actually citing studies? There are studies about men preferring things, women preferring people, studies about men taking more risks (and studies about whether parents encourage boys to take more risks than girls), studies about whether men seem to care more about income, studies about whether *women* care more about men's income than vice versa, etc etc. Studies are being cited everywhere (on all sides of the discussion).

&gt;  However, if people want to suggest we make sweeping decisions which affect people's lives based on the supposition that like, maybe women didn't evolve to be good at computers, then there absolutely will be strong disagreement. 

But come on, this is a total straw man. It's absurd on it's face, nobody evolved to be good at computers because computers didn't exist while we were doing 99.9999999% of our evolution (please don't fact check the number of 9's!). That's not what this guy said, I don't think it's what Damore said either (although I don't remember, and I don't agree with some of what he said, but by all means if you have a quote where he thinks he's saying it, I'd be curious to see it).

&gt; In the absence of evidence suggesting otherwise we probably should assume that men and women are similar, because they are in most ways. 

I don't really agree that it's a reasonable default, that until we prove that e.g. the gap in software engineering gender ratios is caused by biology, we should assume that it is 100% cultural discriminatory. I think (personally) a more reasonable assumption is that it is almost certainly some fraction biological, and some fraction cultural, and the two are not even very easy to separate (and also, I do agree it's unlikely that the status quo is ""biologically correct"", since it's obvious that women still experience discrimination, less encouragement, etc, no argument).

I definitely think it's highly problematic to look at disparate outcomes, and simply assume that it's based on disparate treatment, disparate culture, and take extreme actions (for whatever definition of extreme) to correct that. We should treat legitimate, individual reports of sexism with the gravity they deserve (a lot). But, this is very different than an attitude that says that until 50% of engineers are women, some injustice is being perpetrated on women. Injustice and discrimination are wrong regardless of whether you get the outcomes you want, and (I believe) that if injustice and discrimination are absent then the outcome for the most part should be ok regardless of what it is."	programming	programming	1

895	"There was also a study that showed that starting kids in kindergarten early can cause attention deficit problems, so those younger kids are the ones who started early and that may be the cause of, or one of the causes of the ADHD symptoms.

https://www.inquisitr.com/2512234/delayed-kindergarten-enrollment-reduces-adhd-in-children/

So is it that the kids are younger and the teachers are picking on them for being immature or is it that they started school to early and that causes ADHD symptoms?

"	"As an adult who has been diagnosed with ADHD for many years, and as a teacher who has observed many children who have been both recently diagnosed with ADHD and diagnosed for years, I have to disagree with you.

Firstly, not everyone struggles with ADHD to the same degree. It's far worse for some people than others. In my experience I've started working on coping strategies with some students and they've seen huge growth in just a few weeks - others took months, some were catching on in just a few days. You don't have to understand your diagnosis to do things differently, though. 

When I was a kid I was undiagnosed, but as an adult, having done my reading, I realized that I had been developing coping strategies on my own. I noticed that some things worked to help me learn and complete tasks and other things didn't work, so I kept doing the things that worked. It didn't take any knowledge about ADHD, that's just what we do as humans when we're frustrated about the way we perform in some way - we adapt. My adaptations allowed me to get good grades and succeed, but once I was diagnosed with ADHD and started medication, I found that I could do so much more with so much less effort, and my coping strategies needed to be adapted, but helped me to be very successful. No more grading papers in the closet.

Now, some people don't make those adaptations on their own, and they need help from professionals, but it doesn't always take decades, I would be amazed if it actually took decades for anyone to see improvement. 

We develop coping strategies for every situation we're in, I think that it's very likely that kids with ADHD who are introduced to the structured school setting where they're expected to shift gears from just playing to playing to learn and learning to learn WILL develop coping strategies, and if they aren't developmentally ready to make GOOD coping strategies, they'll make bad ones. 

Some people cope with ADHD by giving up when something is hard. That's a bad coping strategy. There are many others that someone can develop, that they're likely to develop if they start school when they aren't ready."	science	science	1

This is interesting to me. Are you saying that all notifications are always visible persistently on the Android lock screen? Or only certain ones?

In iOS, when you get a notification on the lock screen and unlock the phone without taking action on it, it goes to the Notification Center (accessed when the phone is unlocked by swiping down from the top, or if on the lock screen again, by swiping up to see more of the older notifications).

One exception to this I know of is notifications from the Reminders app; those stay persistently on both the lock screen and Notification Center.

&gt;    the notification center on Android feels a lot more rich and actionable (i know you can expand on iOS)

Can you elaborate on this? I find 3D touching notifications in iOS to offer pretty rich previews and actions. Are there specific examples you find better on Android?

&gt;    You have much more granular control over the types of notifications each app can send you

I have seen Android notification channels, that is pretty nice. It would be great to see iOS adopt this feature at the OS level, but in iOS 12 it can link you from an app’s notification (or notifications settings page) to the equivalent granular settings page within the app itself to configure which types of notifications you do and don’t want to receive.

&gt;    set different tones for different kinds of notifications

Yeah, iOS only lets you set different tones for first party apps. Would be nice to be able to do it for all apps.

908	"I think about this a lot. 

How could you improve on core Diablo gameplay, specifically the end game and loot grind? 

The game already has random dungeons and a robust loot system. 

It’s in a healthy place, and I would argue that people who think the game needs “more content” are simply bored of the game or burnt out. 


I think Blizzard should try their hand at the 3rd person Destiny style game. They’re capable of great core gameplay and balance updates, and they’re also MUCH better at communication and speed of content updates. Combine that style of game with the Diablo universe and I think it would be a recipe for success. Oh, and it would be available for consoles as well as PC.

Either way, I think the series needs a fresh reboot. Diablo 3 can remain alive so and supported for those who never want change, as well. "	Oh, I doubt they’d actually do that. I think they could consider it if Anthem comes along and sweeps away that player base, and considering Bungie has had trouble getting their shit together for about 4 years now, they might decide to do something like that.

It's not until later additions of Action Comics that we see enough details in the city to recognize the location, adding to the authenticity of these versions. Other scholars have pointed out that the art-form was clearly inspired by much earlier works (particularly Renaissance painter Antonio del Pollaiolo) and that they follow very simplistic story lines ending with the hero saving the girl. Later stories revealed much more complex characters with their own motivations and plots that often extended through several editions and sometimes ranging over many years.

920	Not quite sure what the difference is there, but I did do one of them at least. I think I followed [this guide](https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/windows/how-reinstall-windows-3535423/) or something similar, and removed all files and programs in the process.	"Hi!

Last October, I purchased an MSI gaming laptop. The product number is GS73VR 7RG-027NE, so I believe it is [this model](https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GS73VR-7RG-Stealth-Pro).

At the same time, I bought two HyperX Impact DDR4 2400MHz 16GB SODIMM RAM chips. The laptop itself had 16GB RAM, but supported 32GB, and I wanted to upgrade. So immediately after I got the laptop and the two 16GB chips, I took out the native chips and inserted the two 16GB ones (actually I had this done at a PC service place, as I did not have the equipment to open up the laptop).

Now, I don't even know if the RAM is related to this, but shortly after I started using the laptop (perhaps a couple of weeks), it started crashing (BSOD). With time, the crashes became increasingly frequent. They often happened when I booted the PC from sleep mode, and then eventually *always* after playing video games for a while (specifically I played a lot of PUBG and StarCraft II, and the problem was especially bad with PUBG, but it would happen with any game). However, the PC could crash at any time, for instance if I was typing in Word.

I delivered the laptop back to where I bought it, and they tried to fix it. They said the problem was that the motherboard was defect, and had swapped it with a new one. When I got the PC back, it worked just as new. But after perhaps just one week, the crashes started happening again. Again it's getting worse and worse.

So now I am wondering what the problem might be. I did a RAM test with MemTest86 a while ago and did not find any errors with the RAM. Still, I am particularly worried that there might be something wrong with the RAM, as I fear the warranty will be void if I send it back and they find out it's the RAM that's frying the motherboard.

So, anybody got any suggestions? Is this the RAM or something else? Why did the problem get fixed when they swapped the motherboard, but then keeps coming back afterwards?"	techsupport	techsupport	1

It took me a long time to get round to reading it, I had other stuff I was more interested in first.   Now I know what all the hype is about.   

I’m curious to see if longer book titles will come into fashion as a result of Becky Chambers?"	"I agree and well put!  I loved that some of the people on the Wayfarer hated each other but worked together anyway.  That it didn’t require universal liking for them individually to be all content, and the whole little crew to be content,  They could do it with some people being in a constant state of ceasefire and politeness and spending time alone.

922	"The scariest thing to me when I hear these stories is what we're these parents like in this child's infancy? The right brain, which basically determines our mental health, our ability to appropriately appraise internal and external stimuli and regulate emotions correctly, houses all our unconscious ""knowledge"" and implicit schemas, develops in those first three years of life necessarily in the interpersonal context of our relationship with our parents. Our parents regulate our brain chemistry for us, control how much NT floods our developing brain and therefore has a huge impact on how it develops structurally and psychologically."	It's very unlikely. Narcissism is a defense mechanism and a means by regulating chronic negative affect. It's an emergent system that protects one from trauma/retraumatization. Its evolution likely depends on the kind of abuse one suffers rather than any externalities. There are subtypes too. Some narcissists actually show the opposite of grandiosity and latch onto others they hold in esteem (until inevitably those others fail them in some way or another). 	IAmA	IAmA	1

"I previously wondered about a similar problem when you factor in the walk up to the station.

Depending on the location of the station, you can see trains/busses arrive and leave from a distance before you actually arrive.

The effect scales by from how far away you can see the station. This surely skewes the _perceived_ average waiting time."	programming	programming	1

"	I will try to reply to your points in order, thank you for replying, you have a well thought out point of view. Yes birth control fails, but that does not grant the authority to end a unique life to the victim of the failure. There is one birth control method that works with complete success: abstinence. Sex is always going to run the risk of pregnancy and a life should not be ended when the risk becomes the reality and that isn’t what a woman or couple wanted. There is no risk if there is no sex. (I am not religious and this doesn’t come from any moral place, it’s just a fact). There are massive effects to a woman’s body, but they are not the same as the effects to a life when it is completely ended, (and in life-threatening cases I believe that the woman’s actually life or death situation takes precedence). I do not believe men should be able to “skip town”, neither does the American legal system, which compels proven fathers to at least pay child support, which I think should be more severe. Even at the extremely early stage when a fetus is only a cluster of cells it is still genetically unique from the mother, and within 6-8 weeks will have its own independent heart beat, blood type, and brain activity. That seems like a very simple standard for a human life, because if someone only had those descriptors they would most likely summarize from them that the subject is independent. And I am not remotely religious, I just value life.	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	1

You lied by omission by intentionally withholding your past history with your friend when you were asked a direct question. I strongly agree with the belief that what’s in the past is in the past and it’s irrelevant to your present relationship.

But you did answer the question, and you answered with four truths and a convenient omission. 

And, quite frankly, I don’t feel particularly sorry for you. In your original post, you said:

&gt; Something similar happened previously where I didn't tell the truth about something that happened I a previous relationship and she asked me again and I told her the truth.

Why is it so hard for you to either a) tell your SO that you aren’t going to divulge your history, or b) to be completely honest when you do? I wouldn’t put up with a significant other who only told the truth when it’s convenient to him because that’s shitty.

946	my boy showed me him right when he dropped KIDS and I was hooked, also we eatin fam this beat switch	"holy fuck guys, I was working concessions in my theatre and fucking Vince Staples came up to my stand w/ his girl (?). At first it was just his girl ordering and then he pops out and was like ""can I have this shit"" holding up some sour straws. He leans in and was like ""come here real close I got a question."" and I ofc leaned in and he said ""If I get the nachos or chicken tenders, which one is gonna fuck me up more?"" and I was like ""Shit man I don't know, I haven't tried either."" But I was like ""I got a question for you though, you're Vince Staples right?"" and he said yeah and oh boy I haven't fanboyed out in a minute and I was wilding, told him I fucking loved BFT and Summertime 06 and he's one of my favorite rappers and I'm a huge fan all that shit. My man thanked me and pulled me closer ""So if I get the chicken tenders, how long will it take?"" I told him like 5-8 mins. I was shaking throughout the entire transaction holy fuck im still shaking. Don't remember what drinks he got but pretty sure it was two icees and I remember saying ""you sure not sprite?"" and he laughed. I recognized his face but he was wearing a black hoodie so I didn't know forsure so I had to ask. 

My dude asks me then ""How are the previews tho? I'm seeing incredibles 2 and I'm not trynna fuck around and miss the previews."" I told him that the movie just came out today and I haven't seen it yet either so I have no clue but it's Disney so they're gonna be fire. He told me he wanted the nachos then and ""a shit ton of jalapeños"" and you already know I grabbed him like 7 containers of them and gave them to him and he was like ""I appreciate it man thanks."" I also told him that I've seen him live a lot including in 2015 when he opened for Earl at the observatory and he was like ""damn you were there? that show was shit, I was shit, Earl was shit."" and I was like ""yeah a fight broke out at the end."" and he was like ""yeah man I remember that shit."" my dude left and I thanked him and said I was a huge fan and legit all my friends there didn't believe me but luckily my homie working door described him the same as I did so I think one of my friends still working is gonna go and say hi to him when it's over.

Sorry for the massive essay I'm legit freaking out he's in my top 5 favorite rappers and I can't believe that he went to my theater holy fuck I'm still shaking. Don't think I'm gonna go back since he doesn't fuck with photos but I want to mentally compose myself and thank him for everything he does.

EDIT: http://imgur.com/a/Bqwzc3d

I caught him walking out since I had to turn in my 2 week notice for work anyway and I said ""Yo Vince, I just wanted to say meeting you just made my fucking year man, I really appreciate it. I know you don't fuck with photos that much but would it be cool if I took one with you?"" and he said yeah its fine. I asked him how incredibles 2 was and he said ""Oh it was ight pretty sick."" And since Mac Miller is one of my all time favorites as he was leaving I asked him ""Yo wait, just one more question, how's Mac been"" and he just told me ""he's been good"" and I wished him a good night and told him to keep dropping amazing music. Still shaking btw. sorry for being generic white boy lookin but I'll take that over no photo with him"	hiphopheads	hiphopheads	1
947	There's definitely the possibility for endogeneity here. I can't be certain without having seen the actual paper itself yet, but I would hope that they accounted for this somehow in their analysis. If not, that's potentially a huge issue and really limits the implications of the findings. I don't know the psychology literature as well (I'm an economist), but this wouldn't get published in a good economics journal without accounting for such issues. 	"I'm not the person to whom you're replying, but I'd like to chime in here. In economics, we use two different terms to discuss these things – ""statistical significance"" is very different from ""economic significance"". If I'm researching the impacts of a new law has on companies' dividend payments, I could get a very statistically significant coefficient estimate indicating a 0.001% increase in dividend payments from the law. While I may be pretty certain that that effect exists, it doesn't really have any sort of ""actual"" impact on things in a realistic sense. The new law doesn't really matter (at least for dividend payments) from a practical standpoint. 

In this scenario, the statistical significance I'm discussing is all related to the p-value. The reason we care about that is because we want to be certain that the effect we're looking for actually exists. With an r-squared of 0.13, saying that 13% of the variation is explained by the estimation equation, that's not telling us how confident we can be that our independent variable of interest has an effect. The p-value for that estimate tells us this – the statistical significance of our (potential) effect. Once we've established that the p-value gives us enough confidence in our coefficient estimate, then we can directly interpret that coefficient estimate as the magnitude of that effect. That gives us the economic significance. The r-squared doesn't really directly tell us either of these, which is why r-squared isn't directly used much in this type of analysis. "	science	science	1

I think you might be wrong about this. [This](https://www.fedpol.admin.ch/fedpol/en/home/sicherheit/waffen/verboten.html) says those weapons are banned, but you can apply for a permit. However it doesn't say how easy one is to get. It's also apparently [really hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Switzerland#cite_note-WG-2) to get concealed carry permits, but I can't read German or French so I'll assume the Wiki link is accurately sourcing. Let me know if you can read in those languages and if the wiki link is misrepresenting its source. 

Switzerland also has [strong legislation regarding who can and can't own a gun, and gun shops must follow a strict procedure when selling](http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerland-gun-laws-rates-of-gun-deaths-2018-2#gun-sellers-follow-strict-licensing-procedures-7), which is also the case in Canada, but not so in the states. Also, [gun ownership in Switzerland is lower than the US, but gun deaths are still the highest of any country in Europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/swiss-guns/553448/). 

Also, things can be related to two factors. Switzerland also has strong social safety nets, so it isn't really like they have huge problems with other types of crime that are likely to cause gun deaths (drugs, robberies, etc). 

All in all, it seems really disingenuous to suggest that guns have nothing to do with gun deaths. Switzerland has high rates of gun ownership, but lower than the states, it's extremely hard to get them if you're on any sort of list, they take care to make sure they know who's getting a gun and why, it's hard to transport them, and the social safety nets present prevent the non mass shooting types of gun crimes. However, at the end of the day, their gun crimes remain higher than the rest of europe and their gun ownership remains much smaller than gun ownership in the states. 

I don't think comparing gun ownership to racism makes sense."	What I meant was the lack of easily available, semi-automatic guns. No one's shooting up a school with a hunting rifle.	canada	canada	1

But if we continue to reject that relationship (to our own detriment), He isn't going to force it on us.

Repentance is us prodigals swallowing our pride, turning our faces back to Him, and accepting what He wants to give us."	"Yes, I believe that God answers prayers and intervenes, because I have seen it happen. Not in every case that I might have hoped to have seen it, but I have seen it.

But sometimes it seems that the answer to prayer isn't a quick delivery out of the bad situation. Sometimes the answer that I get, that I see in others, is internal. It's a sort of settling of the heart, a peace of mind that almost makes no sense given the surroundings. Paul wrote about ""the peace that passes all understanding"". It's a sort of inner strength that gives a person the ability to make it against incredible odds.

And here's a thought: Christ is not indifferent to human suffering. Far from that, He chose to *join* us in our suffering. That's something I haven't seen in any other religion.

The rest of what you bring up sounds to me like what C.S. Lewis called ""the problem of pain"", and he wrote about it much more eloquently than I could.

One reality of politics is that there really are 'sides' on issues, and two sides' views can be mutually exclusive.

There reason people get fat eating day food three meals a day is because they already aren't the type of person concerned with what they are eating. It's because they are also eating a large fries and drinking soda every meal leading to huge calorie intake. 

Fast food options (the good ones people want not the shitty salads) don't have to be super unhealthy if you just control your intake. A burger is protein, fat and carbs. Sounds like macros to me!

You might need to watch sodium content though since they want their burgers to taste good. My home cooked stuff gets seasoned though so I honestly couldn't even say if fast food is worse in sodium than home cooked. "	"I'm trying to think if higher in fat actually means gain more fat. I really don't think it works that way, but I'm pretty early into my biology degree and need a lot more experience to say for sure. I want to say it doesn't though. Fat is calorie dense so high fat could make you fat because you're eating a surplus, but that's ops goal in the first place and same calories of carbs would still make you fat if all you did was eat. 

Point being that as long as you get protein needed to build muscle even overeating on fat probably isn't going to make a huge difference. If like 90% of your daily intake is fat and you are still somehow hitting body weight in protein the issue isn't that fats are making you fat the issue is you are eating like 9k calories lol. 

Basically if you are hitting your protein goals and calorie goals with fast food in your diet you really aren't doing anything wrong. Like 30% fat or 40% fat isn't a make or break difference. If you are higher in fat you are lower in carbs or protein so it balances out weight gain wise unless you are significantly low in protein because then your bf% might increase more due to less muscle gain.

The lottery starts before we are conceived. Your parents had to meet, and the conception of each was as improbable as your own. And so on back, through your four grandparents and eight great grandparents, back to where it doesn’t bear thinking about.

   This is another respect in which we are lucky. The universe is older than a hundred million centuries. Within a comparable time the sun will swell to a red giant and engulf the earth. Every century of hundreds of millions has been in its time, or will be when its time comes, ‘the present century’. Interestingly, some physicists don’t like the idea of a ‘moving present’, regarding it as a subjective phenomenon for which they find no house room in their equations. But it is a subjective argument I am making. How it feels to me, and I guess to you as well, is that the present moves from the past to the future, like a tiny spotlight, inching its way along a gigantic ruler of time. Everything behind the spotlight is in darkness, the darkness of the dead past. Everything ahead of the spotlight is in the darkness of the unknown future. The odds of your century being the one in the spotlight are the same as the odds that a penny, tossed down at random, will land on a particular ant crawling somewhere along the road from New York to San Francisco. In other words, it is overwhelmingly probable that you are dead.
In spite of these odds, you will notice that you are, as a matter of fact, alive. People whom the spotlight has already passed over, and people whom the spotlight has not reached, are in no position to read a book… What I see as I write is that I am lucky to be alive and so are you."""	Glad to help!  The other thing I remind myself is that every generation before me fought tooth and nail to survive so that I may be here to continue that billion+ year legacy of my ancestors, and to give up on life is almost to spit in the face of every person who survived rapes, attempted murders, fratricides, patricides, horrible awful tortures and all kinds of horrors i couldn't begin to imagine so I'd have the opportunity to try and live better than they did.  Only caveat is that it requires you to believe that life is better than death, which can be hard to believe sometimes	atheism	atheism	1

1. Humans since 1474.  
2. Social or cultural differences rather than biological ones, since 1945.

*In the 20th cent., as sex came increasingly to mean sexual intercourse, gender began to replace it (in early use euphemistically) as the usual word for the biological grouping of males and females.*  
  
*It is now often merged with or coloured by sense 3b:   
Psychology and Sociology (orig. U.S.). The state of being male or female as expressed by social or cultural distinctions and differences, rather than biological ones; the collective attributes or traits associated with a particular sex, or determined as a result of one's sex.*

1945   Amer. Jrnl. Psychol. 58 228   In the grade-school years, too, gender (which is the socialized obverse of sex) is a fixed line of demarkation, the qualifying terms being ‘feminine’ and ‘masculine’.  
1950   Amer. Jrnl. Psychol. 63 312   It [sc. Margaret Mead's Male and Female] informs the reader upon ‘gender’ as well as upon ‘sex’, upon masculine and feminine rôles as well as upon male and female and their reproductive functions.

His Issues? What issues? What did her bf do wrong by stating that he is uncomfortable with her traveling several states away to help an ex for the reason of ""a visit for moral support""? Her bf didn't even give her an ultimatum. So are you suggesting it was wrong for her bf to truthfully and simply state he was uncomfortable with this? What the hell was he supposed to say when she told him? Lie?"	"&gt; she replied it was her ex bf and that she loves her friends and he doesn't say it back.

It would have been a big problem if he would have said it to her, but it is far worse she said that to him. To say that means she is very emotionally invested in her ex, and when she said it, it appears she regarded him as her SO and not you.

In regards as to her SO is, there is overlap and there should never be overlap. So how can you convince her heart to be your 100% full-time SO? It can't be done as all she can do is follow her heart. It also means her and her ex have unfinished business, as their breakup is not final.

I advise peacefully bowing out of this relationship because it is imbalanced. You are her full-time 100% SO, and she is not yours. Whatever emotional business she has with her ex, she must deal with alone. It would also be in her best interests to be free to deal with her ex single. Otherwise, it would only pain you so much if the devotion you show to her is not returned. It would pain her also as the relationship prevents her from following her heart. So OP, my conclusion is that your life would be more calm and fulfilled as a single available man."	relationships	relationships	1

"I wasn't sure, but I wanted to make it clear that this particular mine isn't a strip or mountaintop removal.

The general trend in reduced coal output in WV (currently) is almost entirely related to the relatively lower cost of natural gas vs. steam coal;  there is very little demand for steam coal in domestic markets.  

High quality metallurgical coal is actually doing very well in WV, with a stable market and steady production.

1022	"&gt;Plus, you don't even know another language

How could you possibly know that? I actually do know French somewhat. For example, bear is ""ours"" (pronounced OORS), which doesn't line up at all with ""Jezebel"". 

I also have access to Google translate, as well as the common sense to realize that these already incredibly weak phonetic connections will not hold up across all languages. "	"&gt;&gt;I meant that they necessarily have the same truth value (this is what logical equivalence means), not that they just happened to have the same truth value. Sorry for not being clear on that.

&gt;You are still wrong. Plain wrong.

...and then you go on to cite a source which supports my point:

&gt;- ""In logic, statements p and q are logically equivalent if they have the same logical content. This is a semantic concept; **two statements are equivalent if they have the same truth value in every model**"" [emphasis added]

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Are not logically equivalent statements, even though they both necessarily have the same truth value.

They do not necessarily have the same truth value, they just happen to have the same truth value. 

&gt;Under S5, they absolutely do, because under S5, any extraneous qualifiers are pruned.

The premise means exactly what it states: that it is possible that G exists. That's a statement about what's possible, not about what's necessary, or about what exists. We use S5 to show that that premise entails those other statements, but the premise itself is only a statement that G is possible. 

&gt;&gt;That's plainly not what the statement means. We can logically deduce ""G is"" from that premise, but that's not what the premise means.

&gt;Under S5, you are wrong.

Under what the words expressed in the premise mean, I'm right. The words do not mean that G is necessary, they mean that G is posssible. S5 is what we use to deduce the conclusion, but those logical inferences are not stated in the premise. 

&gt;They cannot be logically equivalent and mean different things. That's not how that works.

Of course they can, and this argument is a perfect example. The premise and the conclusion must have the same truth value, but they don't mean the same thing. The premise means that G exists in at least one possible world, and the conclusion means that G exists. 

&gt;The premise G is possible is merely stating G exists

False, the premise is merely stating that G is possible, not that G exists. 

&gt;In this case, to accept the possibility of G is to accept the existence of G, the element being proved, because that is the definition.

To accept the possibility of G is to commit oneself to the necessity and existence of G, yes, but precisely for the reasons that the MOA describes. It's not the case that the whole argument, S5 included, is present in the premise. The premise means one thing from which we can logically deduce other things, but those logical deductions are not part of the premise itself. 

This is also true of *any* deductively valid argument: to accept the premise(s) is to commit oneself to the truth of the conclusion. 

&gt;You've said that it's possible to prove the possibility of G without proving its existence in all possible worlds, and that is not actually possible.

I've explained several times why this is false. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

"	"First of all software should never allow you to brute force by attempting millions of logins. So that's not how brute forcing works. 

So how does it work? When a database is hacked, the hashes and usernames get sold on the internet, often for a lot of money. From the hashes, you can't reconstruct the real passwords. So hackers can: 

* Guess a password 
* Hash it
* See if it matches any of the hashes in the database. 

[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs) has a nice video where they demonstrate this in practice. As you see, hackers also use big dictionaries to guess for common passwords with variations like a 3 instead of E, or an underscore in your name. 

As others said, the MD5 algorithm that was used before is terrible. This is for two reasons: 

* Too many inputs hash to the same output. So you didn't need to crack the exact password to find a matching hash. 
* It is too easy to calculate the hash. Decent computers can calculate billions of hashes per second, and therefore guess that many passwords. 

The first problem is solved by the popular SHA-256 algorithm. It is still very easy to calculate the hash, but that's ok! That makes it very suited to verify the authenticity of files, server certificates, and blockchain mining. 

For password hashing, a more complicated cryptographic hashing algorithm is required. Currently Bcrypt and Scrypt are recommended. Only a few hundreds of hashes can be calculated each second, making brute forcing extremely ineffective. "	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1

1029	"I was also raised to never expect better and I come from a family with generations of abuse. I know my great grandmother and grandfather were both abused and grew up in abusive families. I was raised being forced fed the false idea that I was my father's property and he could do anything he wanted to me and I had no rights. 

Yet as young as 14, I was protecting my mother from my father's physical abuse and pulling him off of her and getting beat in her place so that she wouldn't get hurt. Finally at 21, I cut all ties with my father and helped my sister move out as well and she lives with me currently. My mom never left him even though I tried to convince her. I wonder why I was so different in how I reacted vs my mom. I just know that I could never be complicit in my child's abuse like my mom was even if I was also a victim of abuse. I was a child and still did something to stop my abuser and did what I could to protect my mother despite the repercussions being horrible for me but I can't say she ever did the same for me even though she was an adult woman. 

Before anyone claims I am victim blaming just know that I was also a victim of physical abuse and psychological/verbal abuse since I was 6 months old (father would slap me, a baby when I ""misbehaved"" to the point I learned to stop crying at the sight of him until I was 21 when he tried to strangle me and then beat me so badly I blacked out) to the point my father nearly killed me twice. I just can't make sense of it and I can't sympathize with it. 

At a certain point, the mother was choosing her own life over her children's no matter how much she was abused and brainwashed herself - when she became a parent, her paramount responsibility was to always take actions that would protect her children. There must have been things she could have done since her daughter was able to do these things to save the rest of her family..."	"But this is the thing - you don't really get to develop those instincts when you are raised in an abusive environment. You are taught and forced to ignore your instincts and even if you have a bad feeling, you have NO ESCAPE. You can't turn around and walk the other way if you're an 8 year old kid who realizes that dad's home early and so that means that he's in a bad mood and is gonna beat up mom tonight. From the moment you meet them or are born to them, your abusers condition you to go against every instinct you have to protect yourself and instead relinquish your rights and safety into the hands of your abuser. 

I've had a lot of toxic friendships in my life and put up with a lot of shit from strangers that most mentally healthy people who haven't experienced abuse would never accept or excuse and continue associating with the shitty person bc my self protective instincts only kick in if I am literally getting the shit beat out of me and am about to be murdered since violence was such a normal and mundane thing in my household to the point a slap or two from my foot taller, 100 lb heavier father barely would even register with me. I would continue to have to interact with him while being in the same room until he dismissed me since the alternative (which would be me listening to my gut instincts) would be to get away from him asap but that would lead to a worse punishment."

As for Peter's statement about Lot's righteousness, you're reading more into it than what it actually says. To wit: Peter says that Lot was righteous while *in* Sodom &amp; Gomorrha (see verse 8), and that because of that he was delivered from the cities' destruction.

And just how you can't ""put new wine into old bottles (Mark 2:22)"", the new revelation needs to be separate from traditional Christianity.

The Book of Mormon is a book of scripture, similar to the Bible, that is comprised of the teachings of various prophets of God who lived on the American continent between 600 BC and 420 AD. It begins with a group of Israeli refugees fleeing the Babylonian invasion of the Kingdom of Judea in 600 BC. And follows them as they are lead through the wilderness by God, and across the great ocean to the Western hemisphere where they establish a colony that grows into a thriving civilization. The pinnacle of which is when they are visited by the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ, in fulfillment of centuries of prophecy. Two centuries following this Messianic visitation however, they descended into cataclysmic civil war resulting in their entire destruction.

There's not much to be done in terms of more efficient heat conversion: IIRC, the solar farms that use molten salt for heat gathering retain more than 90% of the heat before being used for generating power, and there are hard limits to how efficient that heat transfer can be.

"	"&gt;If the block reward drops from 2-3% to 1-1.5%, then we would see BTC market prices squeeze up enough to draw an additional 1-1.5% BTC into the market to replace the halved rewards.

That is true. But just consider that holders don't have any costs to cover (costs in life perhaps, but no current costs related to the procurement of their coins). And it's not 1.5% just once, but for four years. After the next havening, the following 4 years will have 650,000 less BTC that will be mined.

JUST WRITE WHAT I TELL YOU TO WRITE DAN, AND I'LL PUT AWAY THE MACHINE GUN!"	"Edmontonian?

Welp Edmontonian here. I bought my 2011 coyote in June of '10. I have been driving it every winter since. 

The biggest problem is the sheer price of the snow tires. Nothing smaller than 18"" wheels will clear the brakes of my Mustang. I'm running 20's in the summer with M/T rubber. In the winter I have the stock rims wrapped in goodyear winter rubber. The winter tires cost me more than the M/Ts did. 

Now, I definitely enjoy driving something with 4wd/awd more than driving the mustang on really snowy days (two weeks ago when we got that 15cm of snow - I took my wife's F150). It's a little more peace of mind. However

-I have never hit the ditch

-I have never run into another car or object (except my own garage door: see below)

-I have never gotten stuck (WITH the snow tires - the first winter before I got snow tires, I got stuck in my parent's crescent and my neighbor broke off my spoiler trying to push me out). 

Eventually you learn to take 'er easy in really slippery areas. For snowy areas: you don't go into a situation you can't get out of. You shovel your driveway and put down sand because the hardest part sometimes is getting up your driveway.

Oh, that thing about taking off traction control and giving it more throttle, don't do that. That's how i tank slapped my garage door and put a dent in my rear quarter. Instead shift to second and give yourself a very slow roll out. IF that doesn't work dig yourself out. Trust me.

**EDIT**

I've seen a couple replies regarding how driving in the city is different than driving in rural areas. When I first bought my Mustang, I lived in the city, near the city center, on a bus route that's plowed immediately if it snows. Now I live in a suburb and commute in on a highway through rural areas. What I've found is that it's entirely up to how the municipality or counties specify their snow contracts. In my 'city' - suburb - they have their own snow removal equipment, and everything is scraped down to bare pavement and sanded almost immediately after a snow. Half of my highway commute is one county, and their contractors are very good about clearing the highway. The second half of my highway commute is handled by the city municipality, which has their own equipment, but contracts out for this part of the highway. It's constantly awful (very slippery). And in to the big city, the municipality handles all snow removal. It's the worst. Takes them forever to get rid of the snow, they don't scrape to bare, they decided to use calcium chloride spray instead of salt/sand, and it provides no traction. The other night I had to drop my niece off after a family gathering and drove through a bunch of rural areas on side two lane highways. Didn't have any issue, just kept my speed in check."	cars	cars	1
1075	"&gt;Satan encouraged Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge, and god cursed them with mortality in retaliation.

It wasn't in retaliation, God already warned them that eating from the tree would cause them to die. It was literally poisoned fruit, and Satan told them to eat it.

And also, it's not the tree of knowledge, it's tree of the knowledge of good and evil. There is nothing wrong with knowledge itself according to this scripture. In fact, the scripture implies *that they already knew what was good beforehand* and that eating from the tree caused them to know both good *and* evil.

1094	"It certainly wasn't meant to be a trap, only to submit that there is a clear difference between your example of explaining something to your children as a comparable gulf between God and us - *you* are the shortcoming in not being able to teach/communicate effectively at your child's level. You haven't been trained, you don't know the words, you don't know how to demonstrate, you don't have the wisdom, activity book, whatever, and while no one can perhaps teach the emotional aspect of disease or debility, there are people trained to communicate with children to understand these cognitive concepts. But God, who is omniscient and omnipotent, has no limitation - were there something he wanted us to understand, there is literally (literally, literally) nothing in his way... In fact, any shortcomings we would have in understanding something he could simply correct for us. The clear answer from a theological perspective to counter this is just to say that we are not meant to understand, that this is merely a part of the process of coming to terms with our faith in his plan and his unlimited wisdom. I don't buy that, being secular, but it's a reasonable answer from that perspective.

Also, the square circle is a bad example, too... These are clearly definable, tangible concepts whose form is rooted in strict guideline - any change, and it ceases to become what it originally was. We're not talking about transmutation of concepts that must simultaneously be what they once were and another thing all at once, this is asking to explain a single concept. It may be a complicated concept, but it is a single concept that stands by itself. I don't think the Christian God would be limited in such a fashion, so, again, it's a choice that he has to not explain it, and for whatever reason he would choose."

1101	"I am not convinced by any of the candidates. They are a bit wild, some like horses, but no more hints.

If that had been a thing, there would have been more hints during the books. Ashara Dayne's child seems the most likely candidate. 

Also, your forgot one theoretical candidate: Jon Snow. He could be Brandon's bastard. Ned claiming him to be his son would both offer him the status as Star without threatening his children's position. Jon is a annoyance as eldest son of Ned, he would have a better claim if he was the original heir's son. Disclaimer: I don't believe that myself, R+L=J is pretty much set for me. "	"It's important and it's not important. 

It is important what people believe in particular Dany and Jon, if he thinks Rhaegar is his father. If Dany thinks he is real, he is a legit, male-descendent Targayren claimant who is before her in her succession. Would Danaerys Stormborn, Mother of dragons, respect the established laws of succession, or would she rather fight he own family for her ambition? Does she consider herself above the law? If so, this might be bad. And would she allow him to get near her dragons and maybe claim one? 

it will also be interesting to see how she reacts to this news. Presented with all the information in-story, what does she want to believe? If she believes he is legit, she will have family again, a nephew, maybe future husband. She will not have children, but she will have grandnephews and/or grandnieces. Would she rather want to believe so she can have that, or rather not believe and be the special one who claims the throne? She#d be in the same position when she was just the younger sister of Viserys, but she is a queen now, and I doubt she can go back. 

What Job thinks is in that regard only interesting if he turns out to be a legitimate son and heir like in the show. I think (?)  annulment like in the show means he is the heir. And as heir he has a duty to fulfil. Also, it puts him in direct opposition to Aegon and Dany, since his claims in that scenario supersede theirs. If he is an illegitimate son, and indeed now part of house Stark, he is no threat and both can ally with him. And it could relieve Dany of a lot of concern since fighting Aegon doesn't mean she exterminates her family. "	asoiaf	asoiaf	1

1103	"Dude.

You very obviously don't want to have a relationship with this woman, and for very good reason.

Why on *earth* would you consider it? 

Even if you did feel attracted to her, she's volatile and doesn't treat you well. The only reason I could think of for not just writing her out of your life is that you care about her daughter."	"I've had a lot of relationships and watched friends have a lot of relationships. 

Honestly, the best ones I've seen are the ones which make both partners feel like they have an opportunity to feel happier, whether that's through improving their health or their outlook or taking better care of themselves. 

Something in your post stuck out at me though:

&gt;I'm not planning on telling him bc I'm worried if I told him I have all these things I need to fix and am working on, he's gonna think it's too much to deal with. So I'd rather work on it on my own without having to rely on him for emotional support for it. 

So the long and the short of it is: If this guy is good for you and he's the right guy for you, then there isn't anything you need to hide from him.

One of the things that happens when you're in a stable, healthy relationship is that you and your partner are able to talk about how you feel, talk about your concerns and worries, and talk about things you find difficult or frightening, without either shoving that all onto your partner's plate or refusing to let them anywhere near it.

Relationships really are all about sharing, and while I suspect you come from a background where there wasn't much support or care available for you, that person will have time and space for you, and you'll be allowed to have your own concerns and your own needs, and you won't be pushed away to just deal with those alone.

I'm guessing (from my own experience) that you're accustomed to having to be very self-reliant. Nobody was ever going to come and dry your tears and solve your problems for you, so down in the core of you you believe that you always have to be ready for the world as you know it to just drop you completely at a moment's notice. You believe that you'll always need to be able to pick up your shit and be ready to walk away if you want to feel safe.

I know this because I've felt the same.

But it isn't true.

You won't always be treated the way that the people in your past have treated you. When you find a partner who loves you and cares about you, you will find that a bond of trust grows between you and that you will be able to be vulnerable and you will be able to ask for their help. The surprising thing about this is that it does not make you weaker, which was always my fear. I feared that if I let myself start 'relying' on somebody else, if I let myself get ""too comfortable"" and started to ""take things for granted"" then when it all fell apart as I was sure it inevitably would, I'd be left broken and helpless.

But it turns out it doesn't work that way.

When you start to trust someone and allow them to see all of who you are, even the bits you're afraid they might not like, a pretty startling thing happens: you start to see that those things that you've been trying to keep anyone from seeing, the things that you're ashamed of or the things that make you feel weak or like you're damaged? They're not that big a deal. You start seeing them through someone else's eyes, and as your partner opens up to you, you see that they too have things they feel ashamed about or places where they're too bruised to bear being touched.

Your post is full of fears; fears that you'll spoil it all, fears that you'll rely on him too much, fear that he'll feel pressured, fear that you aren't reading him right and one day he'll just ghost you...

...they're all legitimate fears. It's not that you're wrong or that you're inventing problems or anything.

The thing that I'm trying to articulate is that if you share these things with your guy and if he's the right guy for you? He'll understand. He'll listen. 

Right now you've pretty much decided that the responsibility for managing the balance and exchange of emotions and emotional labour in this relationship is your responsibility. You've decided that you're saving him from a lot of hard work by just managing all of your relationship-related feelings, thoughts and worries all by yourself. And that's not an unreasonable way to think. But I'd like you to ask yourself this:

Imagine that your lovely guy were having all these thoughts and experiences that you were having. Imagine if he found that being with you made him feel so happy that he felt able to improve himself and care for himself. Imagine if you discovered that he'd been carefully concealing some things that he didn't like about himself, things he was afraid you'd think were too much work, because he feared you'd think he was too much work.

You'd want to know, right? You'd want to be able to tell him that it didn't change what you thought of him, maybe you'd even want to tell him how attractive you found it that he was striving to be a healthier, happier person and that he was willing to admit to his flaws so that he could try and mend them.

You feel like he's doing so many good things for you, but I don't think you realise how many good things you could do for him by being your real self. He clearly likes you, likes who you are. If he's the right guy, he'll be ready to develop an understanding of what makes you the person you are - good things and bad things, the fun stuff and the hard stuff.

You're clearly smart, you're clearly strong, you're clearly emotionally intelligent and you obviously have the drive and the desire to be happier and to be healthier. If this guy is the right guy for you, you are either going to have to come clean about your worries and insecurities sooner or later or you're going to have to accept that you'll only ever be able to have half of a relationship with him while you carefully 'protect' him from the truth of you. 

The truth of you doesn't sound like it's any worse than the truth of most of the people you're going to meet in life, but with the added bonus that you're smart, you understand yourself, and you're driven to be and to feel better. If he doesn't like that? Then he's not the guy for you.

Go be real. I think you deserve to be."	relationships	relationships	1

1113	"There is no gas. Foot's off the pedal. To continue the metaphor, the wheel is spinning very rapidly and the brake is applying comparatively minuscule decelerating force. 

To explain why the braking force is so small, consider that the Moon is only ~1/80th Earth's mass, far away (238,900 miles, 384,400 km), and the force of gravity falls off at the square of distance.

Since the Earth is so much bigger, it has a comparatively huge amount of angular momentum, all of it left over from when it formed. The Moon has already been fully 'braked' by Earth's own tidal force affecting it, which is why it always faces us with the same side. Meanwhile, we've got so much braking left to do to reach that point that even after 4.5 billion years of tidal braking already, we'd still need 50 billion more years to be mutually tidally locked with the moon. By that time, the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, and maybe even the Universe would all have been long gone."	"Let me explain where the slowing force of the tides comes from, as best as I can at least.

The Moon pulls on the part of Earth that is below it, making it bulge towards the Moon. This is high tide. 

Meanwhile, the Earth spins, moving the part that is bulging so it is no longer directly below the Moon, but a little offset. 

Because the bulge is trying to turn away as the planet spins, but the Moon is still pulling on it (since it has mass), this slows down the motion of the planet's spin like a brake. 

Since gravity is mutual, the pull of the bulge also makes the Moon move a little bit faster, effectively making it gain the energy lost from the planet's spin. Some energy is lost to heat, caused by friction from the bulge against itself and the rest of the planet as its atoms and molecules try to move.

Compared to these forces, the impact of a wave against a shore is so negligible in terms of energy that it would have no noticeable impact on the process, if it even could have an impact. If you are considering Earth as a closed system, remember that angular momentum is always conserved. 

If there were no Moon, there would still be waves and movement in the ocean's water, but these would not affect the Earth's spin (i.e. it's total angular momentum) as they must by the laws of nature come out in the wash.

TL;DR, the slowing of the Earth's spin does not come from the impact/friction of tidal waves, but from the asymmetrical pull of the Moon's gravity influencing both bodies."	askscience	askscience	1

His striking is incredible, absolutely. He made me a fan of the sport in the first place. His ground game shortcomings are well known these days but he knows that full well himself. 

He's a smart dude as well. His ethos is minded towards turning weaknesses into strengths, so I'm confident it won't be a weakness for long. "	"In person he's one of the most nicest dudes you'll ever meet. Super friendly, super polite, and easy to talk to. Really just radiates a good vibe and is an all-around good guy. 

All the confidence and bravado in interviews is calculated. He knows the game and how to play it. You may be surprised to know how humble he is in reality. 

He stumbled over his words and was (self-admittedly) nervous as fuck giving a speech to 100~ at my brothers wedding. Yet he marches out to the octagon like he owns it in front of thousands. Go figure. 

If you're looking for a reason to love him I can give you several, but none for why to dislike him. He's just too nice a dude to say otherwise. "	MMA	MMA	1
1124	Apparently it doesn't harm the dog, and it sorta cracks me when you do hear/or see it, cause it usually turns it into a somewhat squeak toy sound.  So you see this giant malamute or sheperd making this squeaking noise.  But when you live in an apartment/rental community, I think it's more dicked to have to live with a neighbor that has an uncontrollable dog that barks at every hour. 	I used a bark collar and it was great, instead of barking he does a low growl instead and now we don't even have to use it.  I wish more of my neighbors try it as some of the larger dogs are soooo fucking loud and IMO a way better solution than cutting their vocal cords.  	worldnews	worldnews	1

a friendship!**

Hey, my name is HuShang, I’ve been coaching starcraft 2 extensively for the past several years. Recently, two of my students told me separately that they wanted to reach grandmaster in a single year. A VERY ambitious goal. It’s quite difficult for most players to reach grandmaster alone, not to mention trying to make it there in just a single year! But… they’re both very competitive and told me they’re going to practice diligently. So, I told them it was possible to make it with a lot of hard work and dedication. 
     
Here’s the crazy part though: They want to RACE to grandmaster. Yep, you heard me. And they want to let you in on the fun! They are both going to stream their progress regularly, and you’re free to tune in and monitor their progress! You’ll be able to follow them, give them advice, talk smack with them against their rival, and root for your favourite player to make it to grandmaster first! And what’s a race without a bit of punishment for the loser? 
We’ll be letting YOU the viewers decide on their punishment. You can vote here at this link below:

Without further ado, lets introduce the competitiors! First up, the zerg player!   
    
**Schlooti**  - currently platinum league!
   
Schlooti is a 24-year-old Australian who moved to Canada because the grass looked greener on the other side all the way up until the snow hit. He is currently in his third year of a Kinesiology bachelor’s degree and spends his spare time rock-climbing and gaming. Many of Schlooti’s practice habits come from a history of music where he had to practice for hours on end, refining a single section over and over. The man is, not surprisingly, taken considering his heart throbbing looks and both him and his significant other are owned by a cat named Lilly. To keep the lights on, this dude works as a delivery driver for dominos… So, you know he is a professional at delivering on time. Can you say the same for mMRBanshee?   
   
[Follow schlooti at this link!]( https://www.twitch.tv/schlooti)     

And your second competitor! Playing protoss… mMrBanshee!   
   
**mMrBanshee** - currently platinum league!
   
At the age of 24 mMrBanshee is a Brazilian gamer who has accomplished many things including bringing a box full of pig eyes to school, and dropping out of college twice. Now after a life full of excitement he streams SC2 and chills after work so he can provide for his SO. mMrBanshee used to compete in Taekwondo at a very high level until the fateful day he, due to overtraining, got injured. He’s looking to bring all of that ferocious determination to Starcraft now. Schlooti is destined to lose this race, he lack's the discipline of a real fighter. His opponent will have you believe that he can deliver things on time, but let's be honest… we’ve all had problems with domino's delivery before.

1154	[Took a quick search around and this seems like it'd be helpful for you.](https://referencehometheater.com/2013/commentary/4k-calculator/) There's a good chart that compares resolutions, screen size and viewing distance to see if you'd benefit from a 4k TV at all. Also, keep in mind resolution isn't the only factor. Backlighting/contrast, color gamut, and other things are equally if not more important. A OLED 1080p TV will blow a regular 4k standard LED TV out of the water in picture quality because of the color and contrast for example. 	"I think I'm loosely following what you're getting at but I'm not 100%. Basically it's all just data, and how it's stored and displayed depends on the medium. When you produce a copy of a VHS, you're taking a low quality physical medium (magnetic tape) that is very susceptible to damage and copying it to digital (requires digitizing) or to another VHS (bad medium with physical flaws). In the transfer from mediums, information is lost. Going from digital to digital is easy because in the end it's just reproducing 1s and 0s. ""Lossless"" essentially means that you can throw away information without it being visible apparent that you did. Video compression algorithms and processing have improved over time allowing this to be possible. 

Some youtube videos look good or bad for the same reason. Some bottleneck caused the quality to be bad. Either their source copy was bad (VHS) or their transfer of that information wasn't good (low quality rips, highly compressed output, etc). 

BR has become as close to the original in quality because the bottlenecks have been reduced or removed in most cases. Most films from before were shot on 35mm film which has similar ""resolution"" to 4-6k digital, though film doesn't have pixels so it varies. Therefore, the quality has always been there, we just lacked the technology to transfer that to digital, mostly because converting that much information into digital video decades ago was extremely difficult and nobody would be able to display it even if they wanted. It was pointless. Now people have BR players and 4k TVs, meaning that it makes sense to reproduce these old movies in better digital formats, especially now that technology has made it easier and more economical. 

In short, it's become easier and cheaper to remaster older movies, and now it makes sense because we can store a 50GB on a dual layer BR disc versus a 4.7GB DVD of yesteryear and actually watch them because of better TVs and better disc players. 

I was kind of all over the place because it's late and I'm tired but hopefully that helps a bit. A lot of factors lead to where we are now. "	movies	movies	1

1158	"&gt; Modern processors do a really good job with branch prediction, so loop unrolling, for example, is a lot less effective than reducing instruction cache load.

A lot of key unrolls are not about avoiding the branch prediction, it's about being able to use a ""long"" instruction to perform multiple operations in parallel, e.g. when adding two arrays.

&gt; Again, it depends entirely on the specific case, so, as a general rule, you don’t want widespread inlining and unrolling.

Widespread is fuzzy, but ""you don't want widespread inlining"" is fairly nonsensical. Inlining enables tons of other optimizations like const propagation etc. It's basically the most critical optimization there is because many other optimizations cannot be propagated across function boundaries (or any basic block boundary).

There are specific counter examples but most programs will run fastest at O3. Even the phoronix benchmarks that people are throwing around here to try to ""support"" the idea that O3 is sub-optimal, from years ago where compilers didn't leverage inlining as well and processors had smaller icache, have the property that O3 is basically never worse by a significant amount. In some cases it's essentially the same accounting for noise (a tiny bit worse in the graphs), in some cases it's a lot better."	"A pity -fvisibility=hidden is not mentioned. This is, in my experience, one of the combinations of flags that is the highest combination of being a very good practice, but is almost never used in the wild.

It makes it so that symbols from libraries are hidden by default, and have to be explicitly exposed. It should really be the default, but as it stands the default is to expose all symbols (I've been told on Windows, that hidden is indeed the default). While this is convenient, it has an adverse affect on link times and optimizations. This flag is also good because it forces you to be very explicit about which symbols in your library are directly user facing, and which are not.

I have been playing Guild Wars since Prophecies released and leading a guild for all 13 of those years.  My passion is my guild.  While it might not be a game mode I believe that it is people and community that keeps the game alive and entertaining.  Rest assured I do not ever intend to quit and will keep going for another 13 so long as support isn't dropped from the Guild Wars universe. 

As far as actual game play.  I enjoy all the game modes.  The most active I am probably is in raids, currently 3 days a week. While to a point the could be considered money making, I clear run raids multiple times a week for no profit after the first.  I have been leading teams and clearing them since release and host casual raids to bring people into the mode.  I love it because of the coordination with others that is required.  Large enough to meet many people but small enough to get to know some of these people spending hours with them every week.  I have met many talented and friendly players I have known for years inside and outside raiding.

Really, I play this game because of the people and friendships I make long the way.  Without them the game would get old quickly.  I love constantly meeting the people that come into my guild.  I take great pride in leading it.  The vast majority of my time is spent maintaining it and making it a place everyone can enjoy their time in and make some great friends along the way.

Why do I want set of legendaries?  Lets be honest.  Who doesn't want 22 legendary weapons?  They are awesome and expensive skins.  They would defiantly get bound and used.  It would also be particularly convenient to have stat swap-able weapons in addition to armor, and hopefully trinkets soon so I can freely play all my classes, in any mode, without being limited by cost or inventory space.

I only own one legendary weapon, Juggernaut.  I hate farming with a passion and avoid it wherever I can.  I simply do not have time to labor in a game.  Most of my gold is made with long term investments in items I believe will go up in value.  You can ask just about anyone in my guild how much I detest grinding maps like Silverwaste or Istan for profit and rather spend time doing things I enjoy with people I enjoy, even if there is no practical benefit to my account.

I wish you the best of luck in your MBA and CFA.  I personally am also going for my MBA and CPA.

One can't do what one doesn’t know how to do or knows anything about. Problem is though, that Omnipotence makes Omniscience impossible. We are currently researching how to remove memories and have been mildly successful in doing so. An Omnipotent god would be able to remove any memory he has, including the memories that he removed or had those memories. Which means he then can't be Omniscient.	"Dopamine is released when imagining a desirable future, which religion generally does. Religion, generally speaking, holds to patterned traditional practices which means that believers are reminded of this desirable future on a regular basis, so dopamine is released on a regular basis.


Atheists lack these patterned traditional practices which means they are less regularly imagining desirable futures, which mean that dopamine is less regularly released. What it *doesn't* mean is that Atheist brains are less *capable* of releasing dopamine, just that there is less cause to do so.


I don't know, but I'd imagine that Parkinson disease will often prevent people from imagining desirable futures or outcomes which will lead to a drop in dopamine release, or perhaps the decrease in some other way prevents dopamine release.

1169	"Housing is a good example: investors buy houses, because everyone needs houses and space is limited =&gt; price should always go up. At one point investors take up such a big part of the housing market, driving eachother's prices up, that the people who actually need a house can't afford it anymore. Then their investments aren't worth anything anymore =&gt; bubble pops. 

With student loans it's quite similar: prices go up because ""everyone needs education, right?"" But there will be a point where people won't be able to afford it anymore, not being able to pay back their loans, or just skipping higher education in total. 

When this bubble pops, people who paid thousands in student loans are fucked, people who can't afford their loans are fucked, people who give out student loans are fucked, and the education instances themselves are fucked. At one point ""everyone needs a student loan"" just doesn't hold anymore, and everything that's based on that collapses."	"First of all software should never allow you to brute force by attempting millions of logins. So that's not how brute forcing works. 

So how does it work? When a database is hacked, the hashes and usernames get sold on the internet, often for a lot of money. From the hashes, you can't reconstruct the real passwords. So hackers can: 

* Guess a password 
* Hash it
* See if it matches any of the hashes in the database. 

[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-RbOKanYs) has a nice video where they demonstrate this in practice. As you see, hackers also use big dictionaries to guess for common passwords with variations like a 3 instead of E, or an underscore in your name. 

As others said, the MD5 algorithm that was used before is terrible. This is for two reasons: 

* Too many inputs hash to the same output. So you didn't need to crack the exact password to find a matching hash. 
* It is too easy to calculate the hash. Decent computers can calculate billions of hashes per second, and therefore guess that many passwords. 

The first problem is solved by the popular SHA-256 algorithm. It is still very easy to calculate the hash, but that's ok! That makes it very suited to verify the authenticity of files, server certificates, and blockchain mining. 

For password hashing, a more complicated cryptographic hashing algorithm is required. Currently Bcrypt and Scrypt are recommended. Only a few hundreds of hashes can be calculated each second, making brute forcing extremely ineffective. "	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1
1170	"I think it had some incredibly good base systems. The physics based tools worked well, and they really nailed the sense of adventure by reading their players really well and rewarding ""I wonder if I can..."" kind of mentalities. Cooking was fun, trading was fun, weapons were visually cool, world interactions with your tools was fun, and it just overall had a really solid base.

Unfortunately they were missing any interesting dungeons, the weapon degradation mechanic was not well implemented, the overworld was visually bland in my opinion, and the enemy variety was sorely lacking. The plot was pretty much non-existent and what was there was kinda nonsensical. Combat was serviceable but ultimately didn't maintain interest through the length of the game. The way they designed the last boss fight was weird and unfun, almost punishing you with a weaker boss for doing well. Also the ""boss fights"" were underdesigned slugfests that didn't feel like Zelda bosses at all. With no dungeons, no interesting bosses, a very very small roster of enemies, and no mechanical tool discovery throughout the game..... it really missed the mark as a Zelda game. 

If I had my way, I'd have them cut the map-size down in half, layer it more like LttP was where everything is more tightly wound together and visually distinct, rework the weapon durability systems, cut the orb of power and korok seed puzzles down by at least half and funnel that manpower into making real Zelda style dungeons complete with tool unlocks. The story could be improved as well, though honestly that's not super high on the priority list.

1175	It's complicated for sure, because it is neither the cause, nor *just* a symptom. It's basically a feedback loop, as is the case with many depression symptoms. The depression itself obviously has deeper reasons, but the condition worsens *a lot* because its symptoms make it worse. You are already in a bad spot mentally, and then you stop doing exercise, eat unhealthy food and do other things that affect you mentally (making you feel even more worthless) but also phsically, by having effects on your body chemistry. Then in turn the depression gets worse, the symptoms get worse, and you do even more damage to yourself. It's a vicious cycle. We know exercise, diet and social interaction all play a huge role in depression and yet those are exactly the things that go down the drain once depression hits.	"This is anecdotal, but I can say from experience that it plays an immense role for me. I have managed exactly once in my life to eat healthy for an extended period (half a year) where I cut out industrial sugar and junk food completely and mostly ate vegetables and my usual depression pretty much went away completely. Then something occured in my life that threw me off the wagon and as soon as I stopped eating healthy, I spiraled back into depression.

1187	I'm glad young earth creationism wasn't pressed on me as hard as it was for others. When the preacher spoke of Adam and Eve being the first people I just basically always knew it was a fictional story but there was the possibility for me they were two of the first people leading to the Jews. 	"Yea if contemporary writings from the same time period the gospels were supposed to take place existed it would at least suggest some hallucinating cult leader who was crucified for thinking he was god in the flesh and a bunch of people following him around like a prophet.

This is basically the story of Mark which is the oldest extant gospel. The resurrection was added after the fact. Two other gospels are based on Mark and some lost document sometimes called Q. They fabricated lineages and virgin birth stories and included a resurrection story complete with an empty tomb.

The gospel he mentioned is the most recent of the 4 gospels written somewhere around the writings of Josephus and possibly based on the logos. The writings of Josephus were more around the historical events of the destruction of the Jewish temple and the Jewish messiahs that actually lived and recorded king Herod, some dozen people named Jesus, and the other people found in the gospels such as John the Baptist and Pontius Pilate.

The gospels record these people differently so suggest they existed in both narratives but the gospels changed them for poetic license to implant some made up character into history. Eseubius (spelling?) forged Josephus around 400 AD to make it look like this Jesus was historical. The next best writing to mention the christians simply says there was a cult surrounding a Chrstus sometimes interpreted as Christ which simply means savior or the same thing as messiah and the Jews had quite a few failed historical messiahs.

Around 200 years *after* the forgery of Josephus the church leaders determined anything but the holy trinity version of god/jesus/holy spirit was a heresy and that led to a few schisms including Eastern Orthodox and the sect that eventually led to Islam. 

Since this time another 900 years passed before Protestantism and the Catholic church reformations. Recently (1965) the Catholic church has been a lot more open to other religions and science partly popularized by an even older statement from the time of Galileo (the bible tells us how to go to heaven not how the heavens go)... even after all this time it took until around 1900 for some people (mostly americans) to ditch science and return to biblical literalism including a literal Jesus, a literal flat earth, and a literal 6000 year ago 6 day creation. 

Basically true Christianity took 95 years after the supposed Jesus lived to be a separate identity, 20 years after he supposedly lived for any biblical writings to exist that still survive, even longer for anyone to recognize Christianity as an actual religion based on an actual dying and rising man god, and hundreds of years to determine the nature of the Christian god... The bible is comprised of books put in it before people agreed on Jesus being historical and edited to make him look historical and edited poorly that thousands of contradictions remain. 

There is no contemporary writings of Jesus from his life and zero evidence for the savior cults that sprung out of Judaism to be following around a historical character (that had all the attributes of jesus) during the time he was supposed to have lived. There is plenty of evidence to suggest Jesus was made up to satisfy some messiah claim and only believed by one sect who ignored he failed to return with a golden new Jerusalem in the second century AD or earlier. Every christian since then has made up a new version of heaven and Hell and interpreted the bible differently to make it somehow jive with their grasp on reality.. Sometimes ditching reality when they get too caught up in the myth."	atheism	atheism	1

It also does .5Ax1-4slots whenever you use a center slot. It needs 2.1A of USB power for max charge current.

1242	"&gt; Other than liking some of the sounds, what exactly do you think BotW does with its sound design that is exceptional?

As someone also in audio design something remarkable about the Zelda serious is how well the sound design is. Some players have played Zelda titles blindfolded because of how different the sounds are in the game. There's a difference depending on what link is walking on as far as even grass and dirt. Hitting a weapon on various objects will also result in different sounds. 


This might seem pretty simple but a lot of AAA titles don't take those things into account. If a attack something in most games it's going to result in the same sound in stone or metal, if it even changes at all across some environments. 

https://nintendoeverything.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-dev-on-recording-the-games-sound-effects/


This is just a small article on it. But if you're also in audio design then you know most games now focus on background music rather then sound effects and most are digital now. Even in AAA titles it's rare for a company to make the environmental sounds in a natural form. They focus too much on what the weapons sound like and having dramatic music.

1245	"Well, OP seems to be unaware of the latest scientific data.  The issue of biological gender differences as pertaining to life/career choices has been studied extensively and the science has been settled.

My beef is that this issue is always framed in the media as a polarizing ""gender representation"" issue.  While the genders are in fact not evenly represented in all things, there is no evidence to suggest that an even representation between genders is a benefit to anyone.  Meanwhile we have gender-based affirmative action programs, for example the ongoing push for more women in STEM-related fields.  The data seems to suggest that these programs are fighting against gravity.

In the battle of nature v. human social construct, nature wins.

Of course I would be in support of additional empirical exploration of these issues.  Right now, it seems the ends (equal representation) have no basis in reality, and so the means can only be counterproductive."	"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719?journalCode=pssa&amp;

The science has been done, and there is significant evidence.  Above is linked just one study, but there are many others.  At this point, we know that gender differences have a definite impact on the lives and careers we choose.  You had best get used to the fact--it IS a fact.

The degree of impact in relation to other factors?  That is still not settled and perhaps it never will be.

Questions like ""are men and women evenly represented across X"" will of course frequently be answerable by ""no"" and so these questions will always be polarizing.  Framing the question like this is an unproductive exercise unless your aim is to divide people.

We should be asking more questions like ""Is everybody living a fulfilling life of their choosing?"", ""Who is being left behind, really?"", and ""Why?""

&gt; Amuro has changed a lot

Coming from someone who didn't like him in 0079, I'd say his progression makes sense considering how much time has passed/what he's been up to since the one-year war. He's mellowed out but is still largely himself, you'll see that in the next few episodes.

&gt; hopefully I'll be able to continue this series provided Kamille doesn't become even more irritating.

1250	"&gt;The problem stems from the definition of the word god. If that was narrowed in some way, then atheism would mean something.

I agree.

&gt;I reject the notion that the word god should just apply to whatever someone decides it applies to. If we limit that, we can get some good definition for atheism.

The problem is if we reject it, then we are going to miss out on some arguments. I think Aquinas' arguments are strong, and the common atheist counter arguments seem to me to miss the point. Failure to consider the argument as it was made, rather than as we choose to understand it, means that not only are we missing out on a good point, we're reinforcing the idea that the ""other side"" (from both perspectives) are wrong and fundamentally incapable of reason when really we're just chosen subtly different definitions. 

I don't think nature or logic owes us a useful definition of atheism. If we're committed to truth, we should see where the rabbit hole goes, not reject it merely because it places our favourite label in a sensitive position. "	I think it's a combination.

1252	"One basic thing to consider is that when it comes to two critical features of what brains do - motor control and sensory processing (perception) - the brain (or number of neurons in it) must scale with the size of the body, or it's going to get worse at control/perception. Other things being equal, if you double the amount of musculature, you need to double the amount of neural hardware controlling that musculature (each muscle fiber is innervated by - on average - a single motor neuron axon); if you double the size of the retina (sensitive bit in the back of the eye), you need twice the number of neurons in the brain to process the doubled input (each optic nerve axon has a particular set of neurons it synapses on in the thalamus). Etc Etc.

Given that point, you would expect that if there's a simple linear(ish) relation between body size and brain size, then motor/perception performance are being kept constant. Assume everyone does that; then if you can add some more neurons, you can do.. more.. call it cognition, I guess. You'll also have a higher brain/body ratio, so you get that cognition/ratio correlation."	"I was reading about the Parker probe and it's amazing just how close that thing is going to get to the sun; but it of course made me wonder how much closer we could get.

Is it conceivable that anything could be constructed that could survive passing through the corona? It seems stuff must be whipping around like crazy in there, plus the insane temperatures. To my knowledge the highest known melting points are in the thousands of degrees, but I figure there is also some kind of blast force or something going on there.

*Edit* and if the corona is so easy, can you conceive of a spacecraft passing through the *photosphere* and surviving?

Not that it is possible with any known technology, but is it even physically conceivable that something could survive a close approach towards the surface of the sun? What would be necessary (special materials? some kind of super-magnet?)?

1255	"&gt; So it's said a lot that free will exists, and that we are not ""predetermined"" to act a certain way, and God didn't want to create ""robots"". That because of this, he is not responsible for our actions despite creating us. But is this really an option? 

  
No. Even under compatibilism God would have full control of what constitutes an agent's nature. In short, he could have created men such that they always *freely* choose good things. Which there is no logical problem with. Jesus is an example of a person who always freely chose good things. Angels are beings that presumably always freely choose good things; except for that one guy who used his freedom to rebel. But in Satan's case again, God created him such that he would freely choose evil. He had full control of what constituted his nature, just like Jesus, just like angels, just like humans. So again whether or not we view it as ""robots"" or beings with free will in a deterministic universe, God is still responsible.   


There is room for randomness creating ""freedom"", but it's not clear what value randomness would be to God or how it's really 'free' in any meaningful way that would be relevant to moral responsibility.   


&gt; So my question is, what is it about our decision making process that makes us have free will, and what is it about the robot exactly that makes it so that they lack free will? 

  
Nothing if we accept compatibilism (presuming the robots are sufficiently conscious and have a ""nature"" to act according to).   


&gt; It's generally accepted that robots do not and despite future advances would not have free will. 

  
not sure about that. "	"Ah yeah. Moral instinct does exist in reality. It's as real as vision or any other evolved attribute. Trees obviously don't have it. Primates do. You might as well ask if trees can fly. 

You're conflating description with prescription with regard to objectivity. A descriptive account of moral instinct is definitely objective. It really exists, we can explain why it exists, and show examples of it existing. A *prescriptive* account of moral behavior would not be objective if we follow Hume's is/ought distinction.

My husband and I have been married for about 10 years and we have one 6 year old child together. I have always wanted a somewhat large family,  consisting of 3 or 4 kids. My husband has always been adamant on just 2 kids. Before we got married we had several talks about me wanting 3 or 4, and him wanting just two, so I decided that I could be happy with just two. 

We spent the first four years of our marriage making sure we were where we wanted to be professionally and financially before we welcomed our son into our family. Pregnancy was wonderful, labor and birth went pretty flawless, and honestly we had a happy healthy, mostly easy baby! I was no where ready to have a second child right away, but knew that one day I did want another one. 

When our son turned two I found myself ready to have another one. I brought it up to my husband, and he said he wasn’t ready yet. I gave it some time, maybe 6 months, and brought it up again, he still said not yet. This process went on for 3 years. At this point our first child was 5 and I was beginning to get frustrated, and that’s when my husband told me that he no longer wanted a second child, he just wanted the one. 

Hearing that he only wanted one felt pretty heartbreaking to me. I can honestly see some of his points, but still want a second. His points are 1. Kids are expensive. 2. He wants to travel and give our son experiences that he doesn’t think we can do with two kids. 3. He likes that our son is older and is becoming more independent and he doesn’t want to go back to having a baby rely on him. 4. He doesn’t think he can handle two children, that it would be double the noise, toys, clothes, money, and so on.

I just feel a bit lost, and have tried to do some research into it, and have found that it boils down to me having to choose him, or another baby. Can I be happy with what I have, or is it worth leaving him to hopefully “complete” a family elsewhere. Honestly, I’m not happy with either scenario. I’m not going to leave him over this, but it’s just really hurtful that he gets to make a major life decision for “us” with out me agreeing, and that he went back on our agreement when I already showed compromise when I agreed to go from 3/4 down to 2. 

I’m just looking for advice or maybe someone who has been in this same situation who can give me some insight or help me with these feelings. I’m worried that I will deeply regret not having a 2nd kid, and will end up resenting him for it. Thanks in advance.

The Catholic church is using the free, untaxable income they get to protect and cover for child molesters. There is no excuse for this. It doesn't matter how much they spend charitably. They still harm children and have negatively harmed thousands of lives.

So, people that willingly give money to the church are saying, ""I'm okay with my money being used to protect child molesters."" And the church can get away with it because they don't have to disclose where their money goes or how it is used. It's disgusting and immoral and no amount of charity work can change that.

So, any organization that donates or is charitable shouldn't be held accountable for any crimes or harm they do because they might have a net positive influence in the world?

Missing the point. If you're running a node to earn tx fees, yes a HW wallet would be inconvenient. But we're comparing using on-chain bitcoin (where there is no such capability) to LN. The only difference is that you have to sign to receive txs in LN, which you can do securely through a HW wallet.

&gt; In LN you have to use the same address within a channel for all transactions, until that channel is closed. You won't generate or use any new addresses.

1287	"It only matters if I want to make the claim *the biggest reason why there aren't as many women in gaming as men is because of the belligerent community.* If you would like to reread our conversation, that is not my argument. I'm saying there exist women who shy away from the community because it's belligerent. And that's a shame, and we should try to fix it.

Now, I was anticipating the ""but the same applies to men"" argument, and I don't disagree. I'm distancing myself from the league community for the same reason, and I'm a dude. What I think we can all agree on though is that women are disproportionately affected by this because a significant part of the toxicity is specifically aimed at women, particularly those who speak up about it or voice things which (some) men don't like. This is also my response to your last point. This isn't *just* about toxicity in general, although it also is. If you would scroll back to the original tweet you were arguing against, this is about toxicity specifically toward women. I'm trying to avoid the word because of the ensuing baggage, but yes - sexism. Both are worth fighting against. 

And before this train of argument continues, *yes* there probably also exists toxicity specifically against men, *yes* that should be opposed as well. I would argue less than against women, and I'm sure lots of people would agree. But even if you don't, *fighting one of these does not exclude the other.* *These are not mutually exclusive.* *They do not even oppose each other.* *They complement each other.* So ""this also happens to men"" is not a reason not to do something about any of this. It's all the more reason to start *somewhere* instead of arguing ""let's not to do anything about it.""

(I would just like to quickly note that your last statement only makes sense assuming women and men are equally prone to toxicity. I don't plan on arguing about that because it's not relevant for my point and I haven't made up my mind on that, but it is worth thinking about. Just an aside.)"	Where is the proof that it *isn't*, because that's the bigger assumption here, I think.

Things have moved on to estimating how much is down to the genes, rather than whether the genetic component exists at all.	"I didn't elaborate because I've had this conversation before and it tends to end up dragging on forever, but here, 3 seconds of googling, [US National Library of Medicine](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/traits/intelligence):

""Like most aspects of human behavior and cognition, **intelligence is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors**.

Intelligence is challenging to study, in part because it can be defined and measured in different ways. Most definitions of intelligence include the ability to learn from experiences and adapt to changing environments. Elements of intelligence include the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and understand complex ideas. **Many studies rely on a measure of intelligence called the intelligence quotient (IQ)**.

Researchers have conducted many studies to look for genes that influence intelligence. Many of these studies have focused on similarities and differences in IQ within families, particularly looking at adopted children and twins. **These studies suggest that genetic factors underlie about 50 percent of the difference in intelligence among individuals.** Other studies have examined variations across the entire genomes of many people (an approach called genome-wide association studies or GWAS) to determine whether any specific areas of the genome are associated with IQ. These studies have not conclusively identified any genes that underlie differences in intelligence. It is likely that a large number of genes are involved, each of which makes only a small contribution to a person’s intelligence.

Intelligence is also strongly influenced by the environment. Factors related to a child’s home environment and parenting, education and availability of learning resources, and nutrition, among others, all contribute to intelligence. A person’s environment and genes influence each other, and it can be challenging to tease apart the effects of the environment from those of genetics. For example, if a child’s IQ is similar to that of his or her parents, is that similarity due to genetic factors passed down from parent to child, to shared environmental factors, or (most likely) to a combination of both? It is clear that both environmental and genetic factors play a part in determining intelligence.""

Answer me this. 10+ years ago, we had DRM. Far worse than Denuvo tbh. How many people do you legitimately think have been heavily affected, first by having a regular desire to play 10+ year old games, and then by the inability of those games to work?

Literally the operating system those games were made for is a bigger barrier to entry when it comes to getting a game to work. It's absolutely complaining for the sake of complaining. It's a nonsense point based on assuming the absolute worst possible outcome, because people want to complain. It's so blatantly obvious to see for anyone that isn't hung up on needing everything to be some anti-industry circlejerk and some principled stance.

1308	"The western civilization had more than 300 years to grow out of horrible abuses of wild unregulated capitalism. If you'd roll back to 200 years ago you would not find a good capitalist country because none existed. Communism as an implemented idea does not even have 100 years and had to come into this world with wars, basically ensuring that the country will inevitably fail in its implementation.

Funny thing is, revolution is not even necessary. Capitalism eats itself via automation. So whether you want it or not, you will have to face the ideas of communism or see the humanity destroy itself.
"	"&gt; Automation results in society with little or no central authority. 

If that would be true, we would not have needed anti-monopoly and antitrust laws. But as history of capitalism shows, automation leads to concentration of enormous wealth, financial, political and military power in the hands of the few. It definitely creates and enforces central authority. Hence our efforts to prevent that via laws.

&gt;“a description completely disproportionate to the small incision that takes only a few seconds, heals within hours, and has no serious consequences”.

So-called male ""circumcision"" involves **excision**, not just **incision**.

**In**cision is cutting into someone's body without removing a substantial amount of tissue. **Ex**cision is cutting off part of their body, as what occurs when the foreskin (which would grow into about fifteen square inches or more of tissue were it left to develop to its adult size) is ablated.

1315	"I was motivated to get this job because it's located in a smaller town that doesn't have very many entry level jobs. I was working at a supermarket and talking to a customer I was helping take her stuff out for her, and mentioned that I liked the idea of working in the restaurant because it's beautiful and seems like a very good place for someone my age at the time but I was TERRIFIED and couldn't go in, but she encouraged me and told me I should, that she was a member there and that everyone was nice and friendly, so after work I went in, got an application, and got hired on the spot. 

Best part would have to be all the friends I've made, coworkers and members. I'm pretty good with people, I know and call a lot of the members by their first name as they do to me as well, and a lot of them are nice and make you feel like a human instead of just somewhere there to do whatever they want you to do.

Worst part, for now at least, would have to be how bad our management is and how they don't want to promote me.

Possibly because the membership at the club I work at is fairly cheap for being a private G&amp;CC.

BUT you can also participate in tournaments and special events. You get to talk and meet other members. It's basically one large family honestly.

In terms of the stereotypes I like to say there are stereotypes for a reason. I have had quite a few rude people here and there. I was working a fundraiser we were having at our club (we didn't make any profit off of this), and I had to close up a wall on our tent that one of the guys that participated in the tournament/fundraiser opened, he ran up to me and slapped my hand off the wall saying it's too hot and he payed $700 on the fundraiser, typical dickhead.

What part of the post indicates that I'm NOT following my doctors and physios plans and instead seeking medical advice from Reddit? The mention of the injury is 100% context only. I don't know what triggered you with my post but you're being overly reductionist about cardio goals too. If my aim is to maintain or lose weight, maintain my base while unable to run, strengthen for a specific sport, and find efficiency, how the hell is that not a worthy discussion? It's of a flavor that I see all the time on this sub! That's not to say that others maybe/maybe not abiding by the rules excuses me here — I'm saying this is the kind of thing posted and driving discussion every day! So why not give it an opportunity before you throw a wet blanket on it? Sorry — but the rules you're citing, this post just does not run afoul of any of them, much less several of them as cut and dry as you suggest here. Not cool. 	"That's disingenuous. 

1) There are posts about the relationship between workout, diet and losing fat / making gains every day on this sub. 

2) I'm asking specifically about feedback on cardio types as a soccer player and cycling, rowing, ellipticals, etc. simply aren't the same. From a fitness perspective as well as from an efficiency perspective. That's just a fact.

3) Is this r/diet? By your logic, just because I mention burning fat my question is reduced to counting calories? Why should anyone post workout plans here? Just count your calories and macros! The mere mention of wanting to lose fat makes this unworthy? Nevermind that people post that simple of a question all the time and get detailed feedback on counting macros and monitoring nutrition. How is this worse / less meaningful discussion?

4) Where do I ask about managing my injury or asking for rehab advice? Nowhere. I know my plan, I have doctors, I don't ask for help with any of that. I just gave context for my question. 

It's frustrating to read the rules, post accordingly, and seek feedback from a knowledgeable and sizeable subreddit, and have it beat down for semantics like this. "	Fitness	Fitness	1
1322	"&gt; So if I start with a worldview and infer from the world information according to my worldview, then that inferred information cannot be correct or should be treated as false?

It will probably have some intense bias. Plus you're putting the cart before the horse. Worldviews are created by experience, the world you live in shapes your views.

&gt; All the evidence as in all things able to be observed by man? Ins't that a big expansive? I have to see everything that exists before I am able to come to the conclusion I have?

No, obviously not. Good thing others have done a lot of work for you already. You could start with the falsifiable claims your religion makes and see if those hold up. Then maybe continue with it's philosophical claims and see if those make sense.

&gt; But isn't that just you parroting their appeals to ridicule? ""It's only an appeal to ridicule fallacy if I disagree with it.""

No, that's not what I'm saying. If a claim is so preposterous and contrary to what we know to be correct, it's excusable for people to not take that claim seriously. Example: Flat Earthers.

&gt; I have not seen such a demonstration. I've seen theory crafting and massive extensions of ideas into areas they have not been observed. I have seen nothing to convince me that all life mutated from a single life form

Might I suggest r/Evolution and r/DebateEvolution for excellent sources?
&gt; nor that life was formed by non-living material.

You are aware that theories about abiogenesis are not included in the theory of evolution and are in fact an entirely different branch of science?

&gt; Because I don't believe it is equally evidenced.

I don't believe you have a good grasp on the theory of evolution.

&gt;  I have witnessed natural selection in action. I have not witnessed macro-evolution in action

You are aware that macro-evolution doesn't exist? It's a term used and abused by anti-science apologists.

&gt; You can flail about all you like demanding that they be considered the same thing, but you're not going to convince me with said flailing.

Flailing? Do you know the [analogy of the colored text](https://i.imgur.com/oAnfA.jpg)?

&gt; I'm not obligated to believe all life mutated from a single celled organism just because you can show how a beetle can change the color of its wings or how a finch can change the size of its beak.

You do know there are a TON of books on diversification of eukaryotes? Also, why are your standards of evidence so unreasonable? You'll believe religious claims with no evidence but plenty of evidence against it, but not scientific claims with plenty of evidence FOR it?

&gt;  No amount of you insisting that they are the same will suffice. I have not seen any convincing evidence to suggest that macro-evolution as described by evolutionists happened.

Macro-evolution, Evolutionists...Looks like your well got poisoned. Maybe you should go FIND the evidence for evolution, it's really easily accessible. And while you're at it, you should also go read TalkOrigins, because you've been lied to by apologists and pseudoscientists.

&gt; Where did I do that? Was it where I said that I don't believe in evolution?

You do believe in speciation and mutation, but a bunch of mutations over a very long time is just too much?

&gt; Also, so you are ok with arguments that contain zero reasoning as long as you can google the reasoning? You are ok with people not presenting arguments if it is 'common knowledge' that their point is automatically true?

I would just google the reasoning. It's probably going to be clearer than what most people can put down in words anyway.
Let's say I'm in a discussion about truth and someone mentions Tarski's semantic theory.  I'm not going to expect them to explain the entire theory to me, but that doesn't make their point necessarily right. 

&gt; So what you're saying is that anyone who believes differently from you simply hasn't looked hard enough? That is the only possible explanation for why people believe differently from you? Everyone else that believes in anything that you don't believe is simply being biased and hasn't 'tried' hard enough?

No, that's a strawman. I believe that **you personally** haven't looked hard enough, which I inferred from your lack of knowledge on the theory of evolution, and simply faulty ideas about it.

&gt; And would it be wrong for me to think the same of you and your standards of evidence then?

You haven't caught me in an error yet. 

&gt; Ok then, how about aquatic fossils on mountain tops or otherwise above sea level? 

You do realise those mountaintops used to be ocean floors, and that the dating of the fossils and geological strata of the mountains line up?
How do you think mountains are formed?

&gt; How is it that these findings do not support the possibility of a global flood?

Because we have WAY better fitting naturalistic explanations with EVIDENCE. 
Oh, and because flood myths don't line up with anything. Because they're fictional. Unless you want to start moving the goalposts and have this flood last as long as multiple millenia?

&gt; There is a difference between 'science' and the scientific community. Both are wildly different. For example, you yourself would not be part of 'science', but rather the scientific community. Science doesn't need to use rescuing devices to maintain its belief because science is not a person nor an entity.

I ment that 'rescuing device' is not a scientific term. Cognitive bias would be a better word. But no matter what word you use, such things can be overcome, both personally, by scepticism to your own beliefs, and scientifically, by controls and reviews.

&gt; No, I've seen them.

And that automatically implies EVERYONE has them?

&gt;  When I provide evidence or arguments for the existence of God, instead of falsifying or show how they are wrong, instead the other person tends to just try to explain it away.

That means the evidence or arguments can be used to support alternative hypotheses, and thus, are not good evidence or arguments for your claim.

&gt; For example, to say that fine-tuning is not evidence for a designer because fine-tuning can also be explained by a multi-verse. 

So? Fine-tuning of the universe isn't even real. They were generous enough to give you an alternative option with more parsimony even though they could have just shown you that fine-tuning is nonsense.

&gt;  This is then used as reasoning for rejecting fine-tuning as evidence. 

Well, yeah. If two hypotheses are equally supported by the same evidence, you'll need other evidence to support one of the two hypotheses.

&gt; If any possible alternative explanation is found, then the pro-God explanation is tossed out and considered 'not evidence'.

Correct, because a postulate of 'god' is about the least parsimonious you can get.

&gt; Unless the bias is systemic. Scientists =/= science.

There are anti-bias components SPECIFICALLY in the systematic enterprise of the scientific method.
But you can check that out very easily. Does the shit science give us WORK? Like, cars, computers, vaccines, medicine, preservatives, plastics, solar panels etc?
If the answer is yes, they must be doing something right, because the creation of all those things are based on scientific theories.

&gt; What does this have to do with rescuing devices?

If other people keep proving you wrong, the rescuing device might keep working for you, but everyone else will move on.

&gt; Also, I don't believe that. Nowadays suggesting something that the majority of scientists disagree with just gets you shunned and called out.

Bullshit. You might get called out to support your suggestion, i.e. put up or shut up, but you're not going to get shunned unless you're dishonest in your work.

&gt; If the scientific community at large doesn't want to believe what you are suggesting, then they will work towards silencing you.

That's a lie perpetuated by pseudoscientists that don't get taken seriously. ""They're silencing me OMG!"" No, you're just full of shit. 

&gt; It has happened in the past and it would be naive to think it doesn't happen in the present.

Oh, like how Darwin got ridiculed? The truth will come out at some point in such situations, there isn't a great conspiracy of scientists, they all work to find out what's correct.

It's also naïve to assume that your worldview is correct and that scientists are just suppressing it.

&gt; Truth and falsehood have obvious meanings. 

No, they don't. That's my entire point here. 

&gt;  The one I question is belief. What does it mean to believe something? 

An acceptance that something is correct or factual.

&gt; Am I a believer of something simply by asking myself ""Do I believe this?"" and answering ""Yes.""? 

No, because you're not using the underlying reasons for your belief. ""Do I believe this?"" ""Yes, because of X, Y and Z reasons""

&gt; Apart from that, what can be observed within a person that shows that they are a believer of something?

Nothing, you can't observe mental states (yet). All you can do is to compare their actions and words with their professed belief and see if it holds up.

&gt; Is it only a willful insistence that marks a person as somebody who believes something?

It's primary, but only by the words and actions of that person can you conclude if they believe in something or only profess to believe in something. 
"	"&gt; Logical contradictions are not real though. 

Neither is omnipotence.

&gt; They are just an abstract construct with no real counterpart

The counterpart would be a non-contradictive statement.

&gt; They do not qualify as a ""limit"", because they are not real.

Who are you to determine what does and doesn't qualify as a limit? Also, how do you define 'real'?

1323	"I will concede that you are probably right that it's not the same.

However I stand by my statement that a woman cannot be excused for negative behavior because everything wrong with the world is because of men."	"I blame sex ed, or lack-thereof, for one. Men slut shame because they assume women who sleep around:

1. Have STD's (but of course those young men feel invincible and so the same logic doesn't apply to them because they're just so ""awesome.""

2. Have a loose vagina. I can't remember the number of times I heard guys in high school say things like ""She's fucked EVERYONE. It's probably like fucking a bucket of water.""

These boys get poor or no sexual education and then nobody corrects them until their mid-late 20's, if ever.

Obviously, religion is another big problem. But again...the men who were raised to believe that promiscuous women are sluts don't apply the same logic to men. I don't know why that is. 

Personally, if my wife told me today that she REALLY had sex with 100 men before me, I can honestly say I wouldn't give a fuck. She's clean, so who cares?

Oh and it's also worth noting that a lot of men who slut shame are jealous because that same woman won't fuck HIM. You know, the same kind of guys that bitch on FB about how nice he is and how women don't appreciate him. "	sex	sex	1

1330	I'm trying not to give into to confirmation bias but this is exactly what I was thinking. running with what I'm reading here, Ive been looking at the failure state of various semiconductors and transformers. Given in 2018 a major event wouldn't be sneaking up on us, I think the problems could be mitigated. 	"Whenever I search about EMPs, results fall in to a few categories.
*tin foil hat preper folks 
*people who make money on Add revenue
*people who watch too much TV

But never an *actual* engineer or physicist, and enough of those folks hang out here, thought I'd create a new search result on the subject. 

What I can never find, is what specifically ""frys"" when exposed to an EMP? Do capacitors explode? Resistors melt? I'd imagine at the very basic level, the copper will not stop being copper, and mosy software could be restarted. 

 Wouldn't surge protectors, breakers sheilding and fuses do a lot of good in protecting electronics in most cases? "	askscience	askscience	1

1332	"&gt;Why don't new fathers experience a child penalty?

1) Because men cannot get pregnant (which affects the majority of women's hours worked and time-off for the delivery and maternity leave).

2) They do the opposite and put in more hours (and aggressively seek promotion) when the child is born. "	"&gt;That is more tolerable than “if you have a kid and you’re a woman you get a massive permanent pay decrease.”

Women only have a pay decrease in comparison to those who don't drop out of the labor force. 

You're calling on governments to mandate that their husband (what about single mothers or IVF babies?) take paternity leave, and believe somehow this would have a butterfly effect in correcting the earnings gap.

But it won't, because you're purposefully ignoring non-parent men and women, and the fact that men simply work more hours and produce more units (see: Uber drivers) than women, on average.

In that case, i think you should start to become friends with your phone’s “Do Not Disturb” Function.

"In addition to Mr Agnu's reply, since you're getting two lenses it could be worth considering buying filters that fit your larger lens, and buying a cheap adapter/step-up ring so that you can use the same filters on both of your lenses.

Eg. My largest diameter lens is 77mm, so I buy 77mm filters and a set of step up rings - meaning I can use the same filter on all of my lenses.

If the size difference between the two is large, you can buy a specific sized adapter ring that will help keep any vignetting down (though you should be okay)."	photography	photography	1

It’s a 60/40 split 40% finishes in the ufc the rest decisions Connor has in 10 ufc fights 7 ko/tko 2 decisions 1 loss I’m no math expert but that would be a 70% finishing record now what’s more dominant ?

I had the same problem, but I still want to dry my clothes on a line.  So recently I put up about 100 feet of line all over my mostly unused attic.

I plan to put in like LED fans and rbg light strips and other cool stuff like that later on but this is what I'll start with. Also last time I posted a couple people said I should wait for like newer stuff coming out at the end of April and that probably is a good idea but right now I'm using a old dv5 laptop and It's been 4 months of torture so I am near wit ends.

1356	"First: I Was A Toe-Breaking Tantrum Thrower.  I am still known to kick things when I'm angry, but as I am approaching 50, I know not to kick hard things anymore. ;)  Seriously - I broke a lot of my toes, but luckily never my big ones.  Big toes are the problem - the little ones heal up, no big deal.  So as long as they heal up correctly, it's fine, and you can start working on helping your son learn how to hold his temper. (Which, you know, you sound like you have under control anyway.)

Second - your sister and Mom are overly indulgent Aunt and Grandma.  As others have noted, this is the prime year for tantrum throwing.  You give into it, you have a problem for many years to come.  I wish you a supply of comfort food and the adult beverage of your choice to get you through this phase, and recommend you tell your family the barest minimum you have to about your day."	"First:

&gt;I almost want to show up to that birthday party and bring a slice of my wedding cake as a gift.

If you do this, Instagram it.  Because at the very least, she could have attended the ceremony but chose not to do that.  Rude and deserving of shame.

Second:

I married later as well - attended so many wedding showers, baby showers, first birthday parties, recitals, etc.  And from my side, despite sending out Save-the-Dates nearly a year in advance, I had a 60% refusal rate.  Some people claimed they couldn't find babysitters - we're talking people who lived 10 minutes from the venue and invites were sent out 8 weeks ahead of the wedding - some people said they had other plans (and were totally vague about it), and some people didn't even bother RSVPing at all.  I felt bad for my parents because some of these were their family friends, too, for whom they had made the effort to attend wedding for their children.  It felt like an insult.

Guess what?  When it's come to subsequent events in their lives, I've had no problem RSVPing ""No thank you.""  (And so did my parents where it applied to them.) I figure at least I'm giving them the courtesy of an RSVP.  I also knew which friends to value - the friends who would make an effort.

Like many others here, though, I am questioning your Mom's devotion to your sister.  Unless there's some travel involved, there is no reason I can think of that she can't leave her cell phone on vibrate in her purse and keep checking it.  Or even if there is travel, there's no saying she can't just fly in for her other daughter's wedding and then fly right back out.  I get your sister is probably scared and frustrated, and maybe your Mom is trying to make her feel better by not being the only one to miss your wedding...but your Mom is missing your wedding in preference to your sister.  I feel like you should be able to talk to your Mom about this before the day, especially since there's no saying your sister is even going to deliver a month ahead of time."	relationships	relationships	1

Having read the article, it looks like it was just a genuine screwup.

Please, do not let this prevent you from calling ambulances in the future for either yourself, bystanders, or anyone who might need them.

Really, truly, this is not a standard state of affairs and should be treated as just a colossal cock-up which is not in any way the norm."	"&gt;What is wrong with Australian gun policy in your opinion?

Well... I have a lot to say about it, but in general terms I actually think that our gun laws are *roughly* fine, even if they don't serve my *personal* wants and desires. Everything I want is either ""something I would like, but understand is unfeasible"" or a small tweak to the existing laws.

For an example of the first category, I think it should be easier to own semi-automatic rifles. I think they are fun and they have utility for sports, culls, and even for personal interest such as militias, if you're into that. My feelings on this are supported by the gun crime statistics in the US; the vast majority of gun deaths are from handguns, with very few deaths from rifles overall, and even fewer from expensive, military-style weapons, such as AR-15's. However, I accept that there is no political will for this, and if you pardon an expression... this isn't the hill I want to die on.

An example of a small tweak would be reversing our position on suppressors (aka, ""silencers""). Noise pollution and hearing damage are real issues that are often overlooked. Despite what Hollywood will tell you, suppressing a weapon doesn't make it silent; it turns it from ""causes permanent hearing damage on firing"" to ""causes slightly less permanent hearing damage on firing"", especially for rifles. There are some pistols where suppressing them makes them safe to fire without ear-pro, but for most rifles, it just reduces the damage.

There is no way that adding a suppressor to a weapon will turn it into a silent killing machine where someone could walk from room to room killing people without people in adjacent rooms hearing it, like Hollywood might say. [The difference between a suppressed and non-suppressed AR-15 is very little](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuS9XnY-IRA), and if you watched this video in a different tab, only listening to it, it would be difficult to tell which shots are suppressed and which are not. There's a difference, but it's not much. You'll notice, for example, that even with the suppressor attached, the shooter in this video is still wearing ear-pro.

I have other thoughts but that's basically two things."	australia	australia	1

A mentally unstable person running someone over with a car is not a terrorist attack.

Just like someone braining another person with a maglite is not a terrorist attack.

Slow your roll. Breathe.

&gt;Is killing people worse than hurting them?
&gt;Uh, yes. Literally everywhere says that murder is worse than assault.

If the intent was equally malicious, then the outcome is just aesthetics. 

To my mind, someone who is pretty clearly not right in the head freaking out and driving into a crowd is at *worst* as bad as hitting someone in the head with a maglite.

To put this in perspective - it'd be like getting smashed with a small crowbar. In the head. Is that terrorism? I don't think so. It's also pretty fucking awful.

&gt; Terrorism that kills people is worse than terrorism that doesn't, but the baseline is still terrorism.

So we are agreeing.... that ""both sides"" are to blame here, then?

Since there were terrorists who killed people on one side, and terrorists who didn't on the other?

&gt;No, they don't. Nothing justifies his terrorism.

Uh.... did I say they did?

Two things can happen and be independent of one another.

How, you ask?

THING ONE - local politicians shit the bed and let a counter-protesting mob loose on the streets, surrounding the area where the original protest was occurring despite not being permitted. Cops could have stopped it but were instructed not to. 

THING TWO - After the protest is over, someone who was a counter protester is struck and killed by a vehicle driven by a mentally unstable person who was a part of the protest. 

It's OK to be mad that someone is dead because they got hit by a car in the road while also wondering at the screw-ups that led to them being in the road to begin with. 

That's called nuance.

Why is the story not about mental health in this country, once you absorb the fact of an innocent death? Oh, right - the kid was on the ""bad guys team."" Way easier to shit on him and his team than actually do something that matters for a change.

&gt;Nothing justifies this terrorist attack from these people, no matter how much you try to pretend it does.

So let's play a game.

Let's assume the kid actually DOES have mental problems. Like, a severe personality disorder where he really should have been in therapy more, maybe on meds, probably not driving, etc.

HYPOTHETICALLY if that were true, and he was experiencing an episode when this happened, would you still be labeling him a terrorist?

The Calculus for gst removal is more than the revenue impact though. Gst is poison and will always be associated with excessive spending.

Your statement ""Temasek Holdings have never made a single cent"" is a strawman argument. I don't know anyone who claims that Temasek Holdings has never made a single cent. There are several claims against Temasek Holdings

1. The financial reports are ownself-check-ownself. Lack of accountability except to the BOD. Generally this is viewed as a conflict of interest. 

2. The opaqueness of the reporting allows the company to present data selectively. It also leads to a possibility of private parties with knowledge of Temasek operations benefiting from decisions made  using public money

3. The big one in my opinion is the contentiousness of whether Temasek is using ""public money"". The reason why most people feel it is public money is that from it's inception it was given the assets previously managed by the Singapore government. The Singapore government got these assets by taxation of the general public.

4. Those that believe that Temasek is using public funds, believe there should be transparency, or at least a disclosure after a couple of years for accountability's sake - especially for example if Temasek invests in a company, but as a introductory fee, a family member gets a couple shares at a discount.

Parents, friends, relatives, co-workers, all wanted to introduce me to this or that nice girl they were sure I'd just adore. A couple of times I went out with some friends (because they were annoyingly insistent) and the mandatory girl they invited, only for them finding out I was really nice to her with the intention of befriending her. Which I did in those occasions. I was very clear stating my intentions just after the first half an hour of conversation, something like: ""look, I'll be honest, I told your friends many times that I'm not interested in dating anyone, but they wouldn't listen, so, tired of this situation, I finally told them *yes* so we could get to this moment and they change their attitude from now on. I also think you are very nice, intelligent and funny, so we could try to be friends, if that's right with you"". Both times we were dining out, so we had plenty of conversation and it was nice except for my friends, who were kinda offended (those from the second ""incident"" were so angry that our friendship was never the same again after this).

This happened quite a few years ago, I'm married now, and those two girls (from both said occasions) are still very good friends of mine.

With my parents this whole issue was very, very difficult. They said many times that it was something I was doing to them, that I was unfairly punishing them for something they didn't even know what it was, and such preposterous stuff.

Athena was jealous of a woman named Arachne because the woman was known to be the most talented weaver.

This is where we get the word for spiders from, and also it makes you wonder about the inscription ""weaving spiders come not here"" which is posted outside of Bohemian Grove. Athena also turned Medusa into the spider haired demon that she was known as, because she was angry at her for escaping Poseidon's rape attempts, and then she helped to kill Medusa. She also helped start the Trojan war because she was angry that Paris didn't deem her the most beautiful.

1467	"He bailed on the hike, but ""ghosted"" on the friendship. I'm using quotes because even though I know what phenomena I'm talking about, I'm suddenly very unsure if I've been using the right word to describe it this entire time. That said, in my experience, people generally don't appreciate it when people bail out or taper off friendships with no warning either. I've always been told that was inconsiderate and that the ideal response to not wanting to be around another person was being upfront and honest. 

It's unreasonable to actually expect ideal behavior from everyone all the time in practice, but we all have some idea what it's supposed to look like, so what's the harm in discussing whether or not that standard was met. That's what the gift of hindsight is for and for the most part, nobody hesitates to critique situations where women reject and/or disappoint men. It's happened in this thread a few times. 

People are willing to make excuses for the things this guy failed to do (ask about her relationship status, been upfront about his expectations instead of going silent, etc.) but not willing to do the same for OP who, at worst, didn't immediately see what was really going on. Once she did though, she acted in good faith, and I don't think she's been given enough credit for that. She could have bailed on him then but didn't. Instead, she chose to talk to him about it, and I think that was very mature. 

Actually, let's say that happened. OP realized that he thought this was a date, decided she didn't want to deal with potential drama, cancelled the hike, and then stopped talking to him without explanation. How does it compare to what actually happened? For instance, if what the guy did was a 3 on a 1-10 scale of general badness, what score would you give to someone who ended a relationship that way? 

If you think the score would be different, then I'd like to hear why since the only thing I can see that changed about the scenarios is who initiated the break in contact. Do you think she has an obligation to tell him that she ""figured it out"", or do you think bailing out or tapering off is really the ideal way to go about it? "	"It probably would have been better than ghosting honestly. Men always tell women to be more upfront, so I think it's fair to point out his lack of grace in backing out of their friendship. I don't think he was wrong not to communicate with her, but I think the lesson in empathy can go both ways. 

In this case, if the lesson is getting women to realize that men don't them friendship just like women don't owe men relationships, the flip side of that should be men realizing that it's important for them to be straightforward with women regarding their lack of interest in friendship. On an individual basis, I don't think it's necessarily wrong not to, but if men are going to criticize women for dancing around rejection, then I don't think they should be given a pass in situations where the roles are reversed. 

Other than that though, I agree with everything you said.

1469	"How are counter spells a mistake? 

Also, some of the best spells in modern are 4 cmc or greater. Not out of Tron either. Cryptic Command, Jace, Teferi, Bloodbraid Elf, Baloth, Thragtusk... the list is endless. That’s why instant speed removal and counter spells exist. So people can play those top end threats before they die. So it’s not unbalanced. Cutting instant speed removal and counter spells from the game so you and your ilk can “have more fun” sounds like a game I don’t want to play. Degenerate combo and creature decks that ignore everything your opponents do. You lose so much in the way of archetypes and game plays. 

Additionally, you shouldn’t encourage people who post low-effort stuff like this. This game deserves better and the community does as well. OP posted a whiny title and that was literally it. This should be removed, not debated. Teach people who play this game to justify and defend their arguments. Not whine about how their mana dork was killed and that’s not fair. "	You haven’t articulated anything though. All you have stated from all of your comments above are that you want mana dorks to live so you can out value your opponents. You are complaining that instant speed removal is somehow unfair, but the implication is that you want to play things at a higher cost earlier than your opponent can. I would argue that you are trying to be the “unfair” player here. I use that term loosely in this instance because that is a viable strategy. However so is instant speed removal. It’s what keeps things like a turn one elf from turning into a three drop on turn two, potential for a five drop on turn three if you played another dork. All things in this game keep something else in check.  You created an impressively low-effort post about how “unfair” shock is. You need to re-evaluate your understanding of this game. It sounds like you are a very new player, and that is fine. I encourage you to learn more and enjoy the game for what it is. However, with that in mind, don’t get salty about your dudes dying to removal. If someone kills your creature, look at it like a compliment. They understand the value of that creature and respected the threat enough to answer it. People who whine about things like that are no fun to play with or around. Contrary to popular belief, Blue decks are fair, and instant speed removal is needed. You will see that over time. 	magicTCG	magicTCG	1

1473	"You literally just made an argument that steam isn't a DRM system because .02% of their games don't employ DRM, which doesn't even include valve's own products.

Yet you're accusing me of omitting and skewing information - I'd like to know exactly what I've omitted or skewed in this discussion.  It's fine that they give that option to developers, but that really doesn't have anything to do with the point that I'm making. I said that steam is the biggest DRM system on the market, and it is. 

Systems like steam exist and have existed under different companies for many years. Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, GOG, Ubisoft, EA, etc. You don't have to imagine what steam would have looked like under EA or Ubisoft, because they already exist and most other systems that I've used were just as good, if not better than steam, which takes up like 2 gigs of hard drive space and requires 50 mb updates seemingly every time i open it. 

Don't get me wrong, like I said I like steam and I use it. I just get annoyed that people bend over backwards to ward off any negative thoughts about it or valve, but then will at the same time froth at the mouth over another company. People personify these businesses like they're professional wrestlers and it's just really obnoxious how people have these unfounded biases and think one company is god's gift to gaming, while another, that could be doing something better (like GoG) is either ignored or bashed because it's against their naive hive minded train of thinking.

1474	"There are a wide range of views on this. Personally I won't feign respect to a deity in which I invest no belief. 

I do what I consider to be the balanced approach: I silently wait for the prayer to end before eating, usually with my head turned to look out a window. I do this out of respect for those present, but without deference to their practices or beliefs. I do not bow my head, hold hands, speak or listen; because, I am not a participant in the prayer. 

I've also tried excusing myself: ""I beg your pardon, however if you are going to pray, I will excuse myself and return when you're finished."" This is not received well - only because theists don't generally understand that forcing people to participate in religious practices can be offensive to an atheist's conscience.  

It will be perceived as rude and start a conflict if one ignores the prayer, continues speaking and begins eating. However, one could argue: ""From my perspective it is slightly rude to expect everyone to delay their meal while you conduct a ritual for a religion to which we don't belong, but we didn't object. It is extraordinarily offensive to expect that we will also participate in that ritual by bowing our heads, holding hands and listening to the recitation."" "	"I totally agree. I also don't personally understand how the universe came to be, so I've decided that god must have created it. I also don't feel any need to actually prove that god exists, or why god's existence is necessary to explain the unexplained. Finally, I absolutely love your approach of seeking out those who have a different view, challenging them to change your opinion and then simply ignoring questions or points which have the potential to interfere with your world view.

1484	"Fair enough on the timing. There have been so many clandestine meetings that it's hard to keep track. In any case...

We now know that Erik Prince was sent to the Seychelles by his business development consultant at Academi. Do you know what ""business development"" is? It's sales. Do you think he was introduced to this guy because he tells great jokes? Or because he had a business proposition? We don't know for sure, but as detailed as Prince was throughout that discussion, he sure was vague about ""just having a drink"" with a guy from a hostile foreign power. He could have said a lot of things, like ""He had some ridiculous proposal that I would have never agreed to and I walked away from it."" But he didn't, which implies he had to make up a story on the fly and that was the best he could come up with sans counsel to advise him not to answer. 

I could speculate on all kinds of reasons why, but Mueller has better leads than I do. Whatever it was, weeks later his sister is the most underqualified education secretary ever named. "	"It's happened on the left too, but I don't think they are necessarily swayed by the wild sorts of theories like Pizzagate. I said this in a different thread, but the Trump-Russia conspiracy is like a Tom Clancy novel. Believable on some levels, but difficult to pull off and not something they're going to stand for. Some of the stuff being pushed around by the Russian bots and the Alex Jones' of the world are basically L Ron Hubbard stories. The people pushing the stories don't actually believe them in the latter. 

All of this stuff with Trump-Russia just doesn't pass the smell test, and I wish more GOP supporters were just step back and look at it all and think, this isn't right. I mean, we're seeing that to an extent. Even Joe Walsh on Twitter is like, if Obama did something like this, we'd all be really mad, so why are we okay with this? "	worldnews	worldnews	1
1485	"His lyricism is not on Slim Shady through TES level come on. Did you listen to Revival? Even Kamikaze. I'm not refuting that you can age well or age like wine, I'm just saying that decline happens more often than not. It helps that none of those artists you've mentioned have rapped on Illmatic levels over a whole project. I think it's absurd to  hold anyone to that standard when Nas for 24 years since has not been able to reproduce it despite how good IWW or Stillmatic or LiG were. It's also crazy to say that age SHOULDN'T affect your lyricism. Like I outlined in my previous comment, it should. Naturally if you stop doing something for years or as often as you did before when you were younger you won't be as good at it. I agree with you that Nas let his decline happen, but that just proves my point that decline is natural. So yes, decline HAS to happen but by being diligent like the people you mentioned you can really circumvent it. Kinda like LeBron or Federer who have done well despite getting older in sports.

EDIT: Changing your comments quickly with shadow edits is kinda lame. I don't even remember you saying it doesn't have to and also you added more rappers to your list but that's fine. Doesn't refute that decline is natural. "	"Well Idk how long Nas was working on this project. Judging by Ye and what like Char has said this project seemed rushed. I don't think it was the album Nas talked about on Nas Album Done.

It's possible for sure but I just think the added responsibilities that come with age along with things like writer's block will naturally hurt most artists over time. Because really at this point what does Nas have to rap about?

Yea it's alright it just made me feel like you were editing other things. It's cool"	hiphopheads	hiphopheads	1
1486	"Consider that you are not omniscient. The people you cannot find a way to empathise with (who might also find it difficult to empathise with you) have clearly walked a different path in life, leading to different ideas and solutions. 

They are not evil, and the moment you content yourself to the idea you cannot see them in any way but an *enemy* you begin to tread the worn path that lead to the worlds greatest atrocities. The moment you start thinking it is impossible to get through to people, you should find yourself terrified at the implications. Because if it’s “us or them” then the only outcome that is guaranteed *is* tragic. 

At worst, assume your disagreements arise purely because others are uneducated, but don’t discount the idea that there is critical information that you are missing too. Nobody expects you to ever be persuaded that it’s ok that you and your loved ones are threatened, but is it possible for you to imagine that for some reason the people threatening you feel just as threatened *by* you? 

It’s hard. But the final thing I find helpful is to really focus on listening. When you feel that knee jerk or sigh because you’ve “heard it all before,” stop yourself. Try to take your own emotional response out of it. Assume you’ve misheard or misunderstood and listen. Instead of simply replying with your opinion or outright ignoring them, try to stand in their shoes, given just what you’ve heard, and ask an honest question relevant to your own view that you feel isn’t adequately answered. It’s got to be genuine, though, or it won’t work. This way you can work someone towards your own concerns in their mind. Sometimes they won’t be able to answer a question, and when you reach that point you know you’ve hit somewhere you can start changing someone’s mind. (Or rather, helping them change *their own* mind.) "	"I find when you recognise you're playing the role of the ""listener"" and keep that in mind, it's easier to figure out what to do. 

Unwarranted advice in these situations often doesn't go down well. You really have to listen for a ""question"" before giving it out if you've got it. I say ""question"" because it could be ""I just don't know what to do... *Pause*""

Otherwise, basically everything you say should be to let the other person know that you *are* listening, that you're trying to sympathise with them, or open questions (NOTE: These have to be carefully worded. Don't include an assumption in the question, and never try to finish their thoughts for them.) 

Your priority is to listen, not even necessarily ""understand."" You don't have to contribute anything at all except an ear to be helpful. A person is helping themselves by simply airing and thinking through their thoughts, and most likely the only reason they need you is for the reassurance that they're not being silly or dumb, or because ""talking to an imaginary friend is what kids do."""

That sounds like a pretty good partner you have there. It just might be time to drop the ""de facto"" part when referring to him/her.

Anyhow, you only need to file a tax return if your income is more than $10,400 (standard deduction + personal exemption).

As in other cases, it would only come up in the case of an audit. The IRS would have to suspect that some income was actually yours, else it would be a non-issue.

That said, you can still file tax returns and start the status of limitations (the amount of time the IRS has to audit you). After 6 years, even if the return was erroneous, the IRS wouldn't be able to audit you.

1494	"What happened to #ListenAndBelieve?

Why would a woman EVER lie about rape?

I'm sure Bob Mueller's laughter was etched indelibly in his victim's hippocampus."	"&gt;Michael Kimmel’s new book, “Healing From Hate: How Young Men Get Into — and Out of — Violent Extremism,” is about young men who find a purpose in the unlikeliest places. If you’ve ever wondered why nearly all the people you read about who are joining the Islamic State or neo-Nazi groups or the white-nationalist alt-right are men, Kimmel contends it’s no coincidence: He believes that gender, specifically masculinity, is both “the psychological inspiration” that sends young men into these groups “and the social glue that keeps them involved.”

Masculinity is the original sin in the Church of the Divine Feminine.

But they don't like that rotten old Bible in which the original sinner was a woman.

And women don't have to engage in violence to carry out their ideology. Feminists now have the government to carry out violence on their behalf because the promised land of feminism is totalitarianism.

&gt;Among other things, Kimmel uses his unusual access to “formers” (people who have left these movements) to reveal the process of radicalization. Ingo Hasselbach, who founded a program called EXIT Deutschland, recounts how he once drew young men into the neo-Nazi movement. “I liked to approach fourteen to sixteen year-olds after school,” he tells Kimmel. “The first thing I did when I met one of these boys was to show him that I wanted to be his friend, to hang out with him, which, coming from someone older, especially someone over twenty, was a real compliment. I’d act a lot like an older brother; we’d go into the woods together and do things like Boy Scout exercises, building forts and making trails. I’d always slip in a bit of ideology against foreigners along the way.”

Sort of like how Ernest Roehm (founder of the Sturmabteilung) liked to slip away with the young boys and teach them all about how to be a Nazi. His 'mentoring' of the handsome, young Aryan men is what got him liquidated during Operation Hummingbird.

Never trust people who romanticize or valorize youth over wisdom.

&gt;Hasselbach said they’d look at maps of Europe from 1937 and talk about the land that was “stolen” from Germany, and over the course of many conversations they would sow the seeds of victimhood and what Kimmel calls “aggrieved entitlement.”

Sort of like how feminists claim that 'muh Patriarchy' stole all female agency since time began? 

It's as if victimhood and identitarianism can only lead to bad outcomes, especially if you are in an out-group from the Sacred Victims...

&gt;Kimmel does a good job laying out the events that lead men to violence, and the trajectory seems standard. They are people who have endured humbling setbacks: lost jobs, difficulty in school, family issues. Kimmel makes the case that rather than look inside themselves for the source of this misfortune, these men find fault with the system, or immigrants, or unseen outside forces conspiring to keep them down.

Re-write this paragraph and see how it reads:

""Kimmel does a good job laying out the events that lead WOMEN to FEMINISM, and the trajectory seems standard. They are people who have endured humbling setbacks: lost jobs, difficulty WITH MEN, family issues. Kimmel makes the case that rather than look inside themselves for the source of this misfortune, these WOMEN find fault with the system, or MEN, or unseen outside forces conspiring to keep them down.""

What are you working on? 

[2019 Winter Rust Sign Up](https://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/9jx2d2/gunnit_rust_summer_rust_2018_results_and_2019/)

GUNNIT Rust Contest Date is March 24. 

**Explanation**

GUNNIT RUST IS A GUN BUILDING CONTEST! YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO BUILD AND SUBMIT YOUR OWN HANDIWORK. WE ALLOW PNEUMATIC GUNS BECAUSE OF OPPRESSIVE REGIONS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TIERS FOR DIFFERENT PROJECTS. THIS HAPPENS TWICE A YEAR. THIS NEXT CONTEST DATE IS **MARCH 24** IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ASK THEM! OTHERWISE, SEE YOU ON MARCH 24th.

**Current Rules:**  
The rules and tiers are minimal for maximum creativity  

 * No Kabooms  
 * No breaking the law  
 * Pneumatic guns allowed because of laws.  
 * .25acp energy is more or less the bottom goal but not super enforced.  
 * Submit on the contest date titles ""Gunnit Rust: Title Goes Here"" So Coyote can find it easily and link it to the official contest thread in a comment.  

**Participation Tiers**

* Tier I **Built Gun (or Suppressor)** Basically, you build a gun from non-gun components. We have allowed commercial gun springs and barrels(or Barrel Liners) for safety but if you have the skills, doing your own is mad props. The rules are pretty arbitrary and you can convert pellet guns, toys, or flare guns etc. Note that I have included suppressors in this tier assuming you form your own baffles.
* Tier II **complete built receivers, uppers, and 80% receivers** with commercial parts This is where all the 80% receivers, re welds, and parts kits on built or substantially modified receivers would go. Again a winner by Karma and I encourage people to favor the guys doing more work. Note the change for built upper. By built upper I mean you made an upper from sheet metal plates and an MP5 forend or something. It is substantially more then Tier III so I added built upper receiver and obviously your M11/9 or AR-15 can be the base receiver now
* Tier III **Assembled Gun** More commercial parts allowed . Parts kits turn into guns here. You'll note that this is where the AR-15 assemblies went. Obviously the 10/22 that won the category for Summer Rust 2015 had the advantage of not being just another AR.

I imagine she said that only because it's clear you aren't interested in that kind of relationship dynamic yet she still very much wants to be with other men.

Especially if she said nothing about it for two years. If she never mentioned it before but now suddenly feels the need to, it's quite likely that she's got a particular third party already lined up (and has possibly already been cheating with said third party) and wants permission so she doesn't have to feel guilty about it. In OP's shoes, I'd be very cautious and very suspicious right now. "	"Exactly. I didn't think I'd ever have it in me to hurt someone's pet until I lived next to asshole neighbors who were never home and left their dogs outside for 8-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week. One of them in particular would bark for hours on end at nothing. A few weeks after moving in, I went next door to talk to them and got a polite version of ""fuck off, we don't care"" and nothing changed. I tried speaking with them a second time, and even left a letter on their door explaining that their dogs barked constantly when they were gone and that I just wanted them to show some basic neighborly courtesy. Still nothing. So I called my local police. They don't respond to dog noise complaints, even though there's a local noise ordinance specifically about barking dogs. I tried animal control as well, and they don't deal with it either. Ultimately, I tried one of those anti-barking sonic devices and it mitigated the noise significantly enough that I got my sanity back, but if that hadn't worked? I'm not sure what I'd have done.

So imagine yourself in my situation. Your neighbors are uncooperative. The authorities are useless. The dogs are still barking for hours every day, denying you a moment's peace and even ruining the quiet moments because they leave you on edge waiting for the next time they start up again. How long would you last before you started contemplating doing something drastic just so you could have something as simple as a quiet moment in your own home? 

OP and her husband have been absolutely awful to the people living near them and the fact that they've let it continue for two years is just unconscionable. "	relationships	relationships	1

1531	Typically a server tips out the help staff 20% so if the server gets a total of $100 they will give out $20. Usually 5% to the bartender, 10% to bussers, and 5% to a food runner or expo. This is typically based on your end of night tips. Some places though base it off of 2% food sales and 2% drink sales. But whether or not a person believes in tipping or not the waiter still makes jalf the minimum wage per hour. And this is why tipping is a thing. Cheap food and attentive staff is there because of the cheap labor it costs the restaurant. But you're right if you dont tip then the server is technically losing money. 	A restaurant usually runs at about 20% labor cost and 30% food cost. This makes up about half of the sales. The rest go to overhead like building matinence, equipment, paying managers, r&amp;d, rent, insurance and of course profit. So in the restaurant the food cost and labor cost is known as controllables. You can control how much you pay people and you can control not wasting food. So if we would pay the wait staff double, which is minimum wage, since they become non tipped employees we will end up at around 30 percent labor. So how do we control this change in labor While keeping this business afloat? Charge more money for the food because we can only take half of the sales to put towards these two things.  By charging more for the food we can make up for the change in labor cost. 	pics	pics	1

1536	"&gt;a 2 bottled water a day habit is running you $650/year

What? My household (2 adults) drinks only bottled carbonated mineral water. We go through quite a bit of it, especially in the summer, and we spend less than $250/year on it. I agree it's not ideal, but that price is ridiculous. What the heck are you drinking to arrive at that figure? Does it have gold suspended in it?"	"Consider the convenience price. We considered switching in the past and this is the reason we did not. The expendable water filters, minerals, and CO2 all cost; so does the bottled water, but the difference is I can buy the latter at the grocery store. There is also an up-front cost to purchase the equipment -- which is not available at the grocery store. The bottled water is instantly available with no work from me, while I need to wait and plan ahead for a drink made at home. I can throw a 9L pack of water in my car and never purchase a drink away from home. It is far less likely that I will diligently take my single reusable bottle of homemade water with me everywhere I go, nor is it likely that it will hold enough. This is even less practical for my husband due to the realities of his job. 

Furthermore, we don't own our home, we can't install a permanent fancy system. The kind of filters you can use in a pitcher all come in loads of plastic anyway, and I sincerely doubt they're more environmentally efficient on a per-liter basis than the mass filtration the bottling plant would use. To buy these filters, we need to drive 45min away from home! It sounded attractive to us too, but when you consider the practicalities it gets more and more ridiculous. We're not going to switch for now. It may make more sense after our next move, especially if we get stuck somewhere without recycling again. 

As far as I'm concerned, this is our dumb thing. We don't waste money on cable, we don't smoke, we limit packaged products in the rest of our grocery shopping, it's not like we're unconcerned about health, finances, or environment. I agree that bottled water use isn't an ideal choice, but sometimes it irks me that people get so insistent about its evils when other choices people make are arguably worse and those are normalized. I'm sure something you enjoy consuming is not good for your health, your wallet, or the environment, and I'm sure you made a considered choice when you decided you could consume that thing and still keep your values. You don't see me acting like you're stupid or lackadaisical for doing so."	science	science	1

This is the cost for Eve doing what he knew she would do.

My issue there is the punishment, the world is temporary because of the price of our sin. Labor in the field and childbirth, death. Those were the outcome of a situation. The only outcome. Gods will, not ours. This world of pain and suffering was his creation and I find it insulting that the official texts blame Adam and eve. Instead of gods shitty parenting. Shitty only because he knew what eve would do. He knew it as soon as soon as he put the trees roots down. 

I say, if God did create us he owes us the truth. Maybe not eternal life, and never eternal suffering for doing what we had to survive his fallen world. His imperfect creations.

The pharmaceutical industry and healthcare has been broken for so long that it's allowed ""Big Pharma"" to fester into what it is.

You lied by omission by intentionally withholding your past history with your friend when you were asked a direct question. I strongly agree with the belief that what’s in the past is in the past and it’s irrelevant to your present relationship. Personally, I wouldn’t have answered the question at all and have told my current SO that I don’t want to know about his previous sexual encounters and he doesn’t have a right to know about mine (we are both STI free and have no children so any exceptions that I would see as valid don’t apply).

But you did answer the question, and you answered with four truths and a convenient omission. 

And, quite frankly, I don’t feel particularly sorry for you. In your original post, you said:

&gt; Something similar happened previously where I didn't tell the truth about something that happened I a previous relationship and she asked me again and I told her the truth.

Why is it so hard for you to either a) tell your SO that you aren’t going to divulge your history, or b) to be completely honest when you do? I wouldn’t put up with a significant other who only told the truth when it’s convenient to him because that’s shitty. 

Yes, it was a kiss, and in the grand scheme of things — whatever. It’s not a big deal.

It's semi-private, but not back-door; everybody knows it's there, and everybody knows you can talk on it, and in some cases people know what's said. More importantly, this is done with the full knowledge of all parties with clearance. Ideally you use it to do things that everybody knows about and not cut secret deals, but if you do, it's international politics, not national fraud.

Having a back door is supposed to be truly secret. You don't put a red phone on your desk, you don't tell people about it, you don't tell even the people who should know classified things about it. And if you do this for the purposes of a quid-pro-quo relationship with a foreign power, it's even less justifiable.

Fuck Tim Tebow was better at slinging the rock than KB and won a playoff game for the broncos and isn't in the league. Tajh was a much better QB than Bryant and he's out of a job, he isn't even a backup. Who knows why those guys like McGloin are still in the league is a mystery, but its just a long shot to think that he'd learn a new playbook and start for a team desperate enough for a one year QB play well enough to get NFL looks as a QB and ontop of it all stay in the league. He'd have the good looking combine numbers and measurements teams would want out of a TE or WR, teams carry multiple TEs and WRs which at least gives him a higher probability to make a roster spot competing for 3-4 spots rather than 1-2. He knows the playbook here and he has the tools as an athlete to possibly make it at that position, but I don't know of any NFL GM who is looking at KB as a prospect at QB.	CFB	CFB	1

"	"&gt;Reinking used the stolen BMW to evade police for 34 hours. This never happens if police do their job and stop this thug from committing grand larceny. The police wouldn’t have allowed him to get away with Grand Larceny, which led to the shootings.

It's confusing but I don't think your timeline is right.  The BMW was recovered the same day that it was stolen which was on April 17th.  It was equipped with GPS locator which led them straight to its location which was an apartment complex.  So, they had the car, but because it was an apartment complex, they didn't know who had stolen it so they recovered the car (on the evening of the 17th) and processed it for fingerprints.  The shooting took place on the 22nd.  After the shooting, the key fob to the BMW was found in Reinking's apartment during the search linking him to the car theft.  So, no, Reinking didn't use the BMW to evade the police for 34 hours.  It probably would have been better if he actually had the BMW at the time because it was equipped with a GPS locator.  Instead, he was able to avoid police by hiding in the wooded areas and was actually caught in the wooded area near the Waffle House.      "	news	news	1

"&gt; I can't track down what right to deletion means in the GDPR but it should merely be very specific in that only your name must be deleted.

Your name isn't the only thing that can be used to connect the data with your person. That's why everything has to be deleted.

&gt; Any cases that resulted in a guilty verdict should be exempt from right to deletion. Citizens have a right to know what crimes have been committed and the news should have a right to spread that information.

Only if the person effected or the crime is of public interest. If the crimes of every citizen are public, there's no privacy and no rehabilitation. In countries, where the people take privacy more seriously, like Germany, the crime record of a person is a thing between the person and the state and no one else. The publication of mug shots in the US is seen as barbaric, here.

&gt; And the biggest and most complex one of all. Who has the right to collect what data for how long

What? Complex? No, this is very simple. Anyone that has explicit consent by the person, whose data is collected, as long as they state the reason for collecting the data and for the duration that this reason is valid/the data is necessary. This has been the law here in Germany for a long time.

&gt; Really this whole law should be thoroughly crafted in cooperation with industries in order to understand what information is useful and for how long it is useful.

That can only be decided on a case by case basis, which is why the requirement for stating the reason of the aggregation exists.

&gt; There is data I want a company to hold in perpetuity. All my games should hold all of my login information for as long as my account exists for example.

They are only supposed to delete data that can be used to identify you, like address, date of birth, eye color, etc. Unless you request the deletion of your data, your virtual characters and save data are save.

&gt; God knows how much information I've brought up here exists in the GDPR but is poorly documented because the actual steps to GDPR compliance isn't written down anywhere in laymans terms which is something that should also be done when making such sweeping changes to companies around the world.

&gt; I can't tell if the law was rushed or if they wanted to right crappy vague laws on purpose or if it's just a failure to write out in laymans terms what changes need to be made to be in compliance.

Justification happens before God, not before men. James also gives multiple examples: Abraham was ""justified by works"" and Rahab was ""justified by works"".

Certainly this doesn't mean that we can earn our own salvation (and the Catholic Church has consistently taught that we cannot earn salvation). But it does mean that works play a role in salvation along with faith. Faith and works are the hammer and anvil that God (by his grace) uses to shape us into righteous people. Faith and works are both subservient to grace, but both are involved in the process of salvation."	"Most people look at Ephesians 2:8-9 as presenting a contrast between faith and works: ""You've been saved by grace **through faith**. This is not your own doing, and it's not **through works**, lest any man should boast."" I don't think this reading is accurate.

I think Ephesians 2:8-9 is contrasting *grace* and works, not *faith* and works. ""It is by **grace** you have been saved (through faith); it is not your own doing, and not **as a result of works** lest any man should boast.""

1595	"&gt;The dots themselves are obviously physical (as little bits of your screen lit up brighter than nearby spots), but the more abstract concept of a 'line'? That only exists because of the physical relationship between the 8 dots. Still, though, that relationship is physical.

This is where it all falls apart. You're telling me the dots exist, because they are the ink on the page, but you're not telling me what a line IS. Math doesn't exist in your world. Pure and simple. Now, toes can be counted, and scores can be added, but math isn't a physical thing. Period. End of story. Math is a concept that you apply to real things. 

Your idea caves in on itself. No one really believes that. No one truly believes only the physical exists. You said it yourself, math is a concept. What you have to accept is that a concept exists, because the definition of exists is:
have objective reality or being.

Objective:
not influenced by personal feelings or opinions in considering and representing facts.

Real:
actually existing as a thing or occurring in fact; not imagined or supposed.

Being:
existence.

Math is an occurring fact not influenced by your personal feelings. 2+2 is always 4. Math exists, it is not physical. *shrugs* It's a simple concept. It ruins your idea of reality because your idea of reality is based on a presupposition you have, not the definition of the word reality.

EDIT:
To drive the point home:

Concept: an abstract idea; a general notion.

Abstract: **existing in thought** *or* as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.

You can see based on the definition of abstract that there are things with physical or concrete existence. Physical or concrete is a type of thing that exists. A physical existence, or a concrete existence. You can also have a non-physical existence as I described above. 

Existing in thought. Thoughts are not physical. It's like a rant, but it's just laughably false that everything is physical. 

"	"The 'six' day creation is my comment on significant number not believing. What would have been more clear is to say that 'the 6 day creation view is not a majority view'. The expansion is simply to note that the biblical age we get is based on how you read the bible. Some add all of the genealogies to get the age of the earth, which isn't really a certain conclusion. I don't think people understand that there isn't a bible verse saying ""The earth is X years old.""

&gt;Whether the number is 18% or 39% or any percent between, I would say that is indeed a significant number. Or were you just talking about the 6 day creation thing? 

I think you're pushing back from the wrong side here. I would argue that either 62% or 82% is a significant number that do not believe. 

At the same time your point is well made. As I said above a better wording would have been to say the majority does not hold the 'Young Earth Creation View'."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Look at banks. Banks are incredibly regulated. My father was a CFO of a mid-sized bank. One of their claims to *success* was lower NFS fees. This attracted obviously lots of poorer customers who willingly overdrew their accounts and racked up charges. The government sees this and says that's exploitation. His bank did a study of the customers who overdrew to understand why they were doing this. They found out it wasn't from a lack of understanding how NFS charges work but that it was ***cheaper*** than the alternative like a late phone bill or power bill! This same finding occurred when evaluating pay day loans. [Source](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/payday-loans/). When big brother stepped in to try to regulate they actually hurt consumers by removing their only options to credit. 

Your point regarding lobbyist isn't without merit. Companies use government to create regulations that hinder their competition. This is what the cable/telecomes companies have done. I'm in agreement with you that government has failed us in prohibiting these monopolies and oligopolies to form. I'm fully in support of co-ops forming to compete against these overpowered private interests. "	"&gt; Also Obamacare slowed the rise in insurance prices and healthcare costs.

I've heard this argument so much that it's been accepted as truth however I find it very disingenuous since: ""One reason for moderate premium growth in employer-sponsored insurance is the steep increase in deductibles, which rose from $616 in 2007 to $1,505 in 2017 [4]. Increases in required cost-sharing (eg, copayments) and the spread of high-deductible insurance, which started before the ACA's enactment and shows no sign of abating, have left many workers feeling underinsured.""

You keep insisting on a discussion, and that was never my intention. Imagine you, me, and a group of people are standing around. Now picture 200 children and women say ""that guy over there molested us for years,"" and that guy then says ""yeah, I did, sorry about that."" Now, that is more than enough for most rational human beings. We would advocate justice for his victims, and certainly wouldn't want our own kids around him. Once he is tried in court, we respect the ruling and applaud the legal system for rightfully protecting minority victims from a predator.

But there's one guy in the group (you in this case) who goes ""hold on everybody, we need to discuss how this guy is probably not really guilty, and is himself a victim of a liberal witch hunt by people frustrated with Trump. And while we're on the subject, let's talk about how touching kids wouldn't be so bad if we just didn't make such a big deal about it."" 

At this point, I look to the other people in the group and say, ""This guy either has such bad judgement that he can't recognize a self admitted predator, or he does recognize the situation and just dose not care - in which case, he has poor values. Regardless, he either has poor judgement or poor values, and we don't really need to waste time talking to him.""

You don't like that, say I'm calling you names, and then call the entire group prudes.

Now I admit, I have not been nice to you, and that is not something I enjoy. But, you are easy to read. From the beginning, I said you had a strong bias, poor judgement, and poor values. You are certainly not someone I would ever want around my or anyone else's children. Even if you are not a predator yourself, I don't believe you have the common sense to recognize one.

1621	"&gt; They may not have WANTED to fight, but they sure were fighting for slavery. Straight up, unambiguous fighting to protect the institution of slavery.

They seceded for a myriad of reasons, and, yes, slavery was the *single* biggest issue. However, saying the Confederacy/Civil War was *about* slavery is like saying the American Revolution was about taxes.

The root issue was that there were major political divides between the North and South (and not just on slavery).  The North used it's massive population (comparatively) to wield political power in the Federal government passing laws very unpopular in the South (again, the slavery issue is a blatant example).

[Look at the 1860 Presidential election for a visible representation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860#/media/File:PresidentialCounty1860Colorbrewer.gif)  Lincoln was elected despite the fact that he didn't carry a single Southern district.  Imagine if this was the 2016 election map.

However, the Civil War itself was to preserve the Union/preserve independence from the Union - not to end or preserve slavery.  Lincoln himself said that if he could have preserved the Union by allowing slavery to continue, he would have. Additionally, Congress had introduced bills to allow the South to keep their slaves and yet the South **still** chose to leave - simply because they no longer trusted the North to act in good faith for both parties. The [Crittenden Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crittenden_Compromise) and the [Corwin Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corwin_Amendment) and the [Dred Scott case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford) just years earlier are prime examples of this.

Even more to the point, the average Southern soldier didn't own slaves and the average Northerner who fought for the Union would be considered severely racist by today's standard's as well.  Had they believed that they were dying en-mass only to end/preserve slavery, nobody would have fought.

Even more, several slave holding States (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee) stayed in the Union - [up until Lincoln declared de-facto war on the then Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lincoln%27s_75,000_volunteers).  They switched because they believed that the Union under Lincoln was the aggressor - as is stated by officials in each state.

1623	"For one, I'd be curious to read those Dead Sea Scrolls that she is referencing. For two, that's an impossible explanation of Jesus walking on the sater. (A) the Gospels specify he was in the middle of the lake, not on the edge (Mt. 14.24; John 6.19; the lake is 13 miles x 7 miles. That would be QUITE a jetty!). (B) There was a violent storm going on (John 6.18). It's not a plausible explanation for this situation.

Secondly, not everything is subject to evidence. I saw a rainbow two weeks ago. I have no evidence of it, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. Rainbows don't leave evidence. For the Jesus story, we have three accounts of its occurrence. It's not like they could take a picture. The only people who could testify to its truth are the 12 disciples who saw it. There's no other possibility for evidence, not even corroborating records. Only 12 people saw it. A few years back some friends and I saw a mountain lion cross the road in Vermont. Scientists say there are no mountain lions in Vermont. He was there and gone before we could take a picture. None of us have any evidence; there are no corroborating records. But we know what we saw. We all saw it. You say there is ""absolutely no evidence"" of the walking on water, but we do have evidence. We have the records from those who were eyewitnesses. Though you may doubt Matthew (as many people do, but I don't), John's Gospel is much more an account from an eyewitness. That's the evidence we have. To rebut the accounts you have to prove that Matthew and John are incompetent to be telling us history."	"&gt; You start with an entirely false claim about the nature of slavery

Disgusting apologetic? Perhaps you think there should be no punishment for blasphemy. But since we're in a section about debating religion, possibly you want to know that blaspheming God is one of the most serious offenses around. I would expect that any judge and jury, if they are doing their job, give serious punishments for serious offenses. To me, that's the point. Reward good, punish bad.

What is the appeal of GraphQL over the OData standard? Is it simply anti-MS sentiment (and a lack of implementation frameworks in non .NET languages)?

I was communicating with the developers of one of our customers explaining our usage OData in an API we were considering exposing to them, and they suggested we consider GraphQL.

I had never heard of it, so started researching it. Not only did it deviate from REST spec (have to POST when getting data) the way you built queries and filters just seemed awkward and unintuitive compared to OData's SQL like query language using query string variables.

1631	"How I do it : 

1 main multiplayer game (used to be CS then stuff like Planetside, CSGO, H1Z1) now it's PUBG and rocket league from time to time.

I like to become good at one game at a time when it comes to a more multiplayer/competitive game and stick with it untill I get bored and move on to the next thing.

Then I make a list. I'll get 1 single player game that I CANNOT discard for anything else untill it's completed (unless the game is trash but I usually pick something I know I'll enjoy). 

This is hard to do sometimes but I always tell myself that If I want to play the next thing on my list I just need to power through it, sometimes that means to forget about side-quests etc, but I don't like to leave a game without seeing the ending. (I leave exceptions for games I decided to replay). 

So my main SP game right now is FarCry5 but I'm replaying Bloodborne at the same time, it works for me too since one is on PC and the other one is on console. 

Anyway... this works for me... but I almost need to make a list and stick with it, review the list every 2-3 months maybe to add or change stuff (for which games take priority next) It's also a great way to wait for sales since... if you know X games is 3-4 games away on the list there's just no reason to buy it now.

It’s an obligation, and your first sentence shows that you aren’t fully understanding what the burden is and means. Just think about it logically, can you actually prove that the purple invisible elephant doesn’t exist? Like seriously prove to me it doesn’t exist and isn’t floating above you right now...

To entertain your question here is my answer: There was never evidence to say god does exist. Why am I trying to disprove something to you that was never proved in the first place? How *can* you disprove something that was never proved? And no, I don’t think we would end up at the same place. I wouldn’t have anything to prove since I’m not making any claim? The religious person would begin trying to prove god’s existence through normal religious examples (miracles, complexity of life, etc.)

The burden of proof isn’t a cop out, it’s a method that’s used to determine if the claims a party has made can be backed up or proved. If people are going to make claims, then they need to be backed up and the burden of backing it up lies on the person making the claim. 

The issue, is that religion is so tied into our lives, that people are literally born with the belief that religion and gods are already accepted as “proven”.

If you run out of AdBlue and delete the error your car will start but it will not meet the Euro 6 anymore. So you will be driving illegaly.	One reason that is often brought up is removal of engine errors that would otherwise make you unable to start it like low levels or no AdBlue at all.

1639	"There is nothing wrong with the overarching method they are pursuing their point, even if there may be problems with a specific argument they make.

A Christian wants you to believe in Christianity. I, as an atheist, doubt their god claim. For them to get me from where I am now to becoming a Christian, they must create a logical path. They must first successfully convince me a god exists before they can make any further arguments that their god exists and is the only god. You are right when you say that demonstrating *a* god exists is not the same as demonstrating their specific god exists and their dogma is correct, but you are wrong to fault them for attempting to make this first and important logical link.
