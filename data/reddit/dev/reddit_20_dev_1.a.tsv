And, I don‚Äôt understand what arranged marriages have to do with remaining single. More likely, women have more social and societal mobility to chose their partners and women have the opportunity to remain single if they so desire. Society previously, and I would argue still, puts pressure on women to find their value through their relationships. Modern society has hopefully reduced those pressures a bit therefore changing the demand for relationships, but I don‚Äôt see the correlation with male shyness and flirting as these aren‚Äôt necessarily relational currency.

But there's arguments to be had about whether or not that's accurate. "	"Ok being a horrid asshole to drop some facts, and I do this because behaviorism, sentience and higher cognitive-function is something of a passion of mine. 

**Crow's do NOT know what ""death"" is, most humans don't even know that**, secondly **all animals- and organisms of prey know what ""fear"" is**. It's why human beings fear the unknown, why we automatically dislike difference, why we fear the dark, why we'll see our clothe on a chair as a burglar or a monster: But **we'd never see a thief/burglar as a piece of cloth on a chair**. ""Fear"" is a response to analyze, react, or flee from a unknown function. Godamn bugs have this reaction, that doesn't mean they know what true ""terror"" or ""fear"" is. 

That's our biology.

""Fear"" is one of the hardest things to ever define in earth-life because you *literally* have it even among alpha-predators like Lions, just **[look at these humans stealing meat from lions literally from under their nose, with no real enemies even lions flee in panic when faced with the unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBpu4DAvwI8)**.


But back to the topic at hand. 

Crows are still smart as shit, they know displacement of volume, something humankids don't understand until the age of 4-6, which is why kids are so fucking horrid at pouring liquids from containers. **Dogs and cats don't even understand this**, far from it. Also they're one of the few species seen having fun without any real biological narrative as a genesis. For example, dogs, cats, even humans, we are ticklish but that comes from a urge for us to learn to protect vulnerable areas like armpits, neck, crotch etc., but to ride down a sled down a slope of snow has no real (known) biological prerogative. Same with crows, yet they are one of the few known species to actually sled down snow with objects.

Plus for example... Florida is fucking big and if you aren't putting anything in it then you have a LOT of distance to cover with each mile you lose efficiency and power. 

Liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof. A plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit, draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage.

""least utilized hours for power consumption presently"" Until you have a very cold winter and everyone is running their heat and charging their cars. My city had a big cold snap and they said they hit their largest peak load in over a decade. 

Its about 400 miles down from the Georgia Florida border to the tip. You are looking at a 5 % loss of power to get it all the way down there. Doesn't seem like a lot but it is especially during times where you are not at optimal power generating hours. 

This isn't taking into thought the keys which will need power still but don't have enough land to generate their own. 

But enough of Florida. What about a state like California. You would need to find a place to put a power farm. That will also cause issues because the mountains, Depending on where it is earthquakes are a possible problem a well. 

I am very pro clean energy but it isn't as simple as people say it is and  things like Solar and Wind are probably not what we want for large scale energy production.

33	"  I've been lurking on this sub for over a year now, never thought anything would ever happen to me that I would end up posting here... until tonight.
  
  Today was freakishly warm, up to 72 degrees where I'm at, when we've had (mostly) nothing but cold, dreary weather recently. So, being the ride-even-in-sub-freezing-temperatures motorcycle guy that I am, I decided to take another ride, this time at night. 

  Started off being a great ride, there were tons of motorcycles out taking advantage of the weather and I was just heading back to my house when I fucked up;

  On the stretch to my house, I'm cruising at the speed limit enjoying the scenery, when all the sudden a car with bright lights comes right up to my ass, and stays there.  Being a motorcycle rider that enjoys keeping his license, I typically don't speed over the standard 5 over, and every day you'll have cars riding your ass, seemingly because they assume since you're on a sportbike, you should be going fast. Well, this happend to me all throughout the day, and now this car was really pissing me off..

  About half a mile down the road, they're still on my ass. Way too close. Obnoxiously close. I've had enough of this today, and I snapped. I nailed the throttle, and took off like a rocket down the road, just to show my ass and maybe get the message across they need to give me some space. Once I've gone a few times over the speed limit, I look in my mirror, and see the flashing blues...

At this point Im literally just a few hundred feet from my house, which is pure figurative insult to injury. I immediately stopped, and waited to see what terrible things were about to transpire... until me and the officer got talking, I explained what I *thought* had been going on, and get handed a ticket totaling around 100$ for not having a tag light... that was it. 

  The worst part is I never do this. I'm always the calm rider who does everything in my power to not be ""*one of those*"" motorcycle riders. I had just been tailgated so close, so many times today, that I snapped... and the *only* time I do this, it happens to be a cop. Fortunately, I was let of extremely easily. If he wanted to he could have ruined my world. Let this also be a lesson to other riders; when its warm and other riders are out, the *bad* riders are also out, and cops are likely to assume you may be one of them. Ride safe! (And smart!)

TL;DR: Got tailgated, wanted to show my ass and sped off on my motorcycle to send a message - tailgater turned out to be a cop, but I only got a minor ticket.

You started out with ""illegal"" then ended up arguing with ""legal"". I never said that the entire US is MY property. I argue that a nation has territory. If you're arguing for abolishing all nation-state borders in the world, just say it.

The few basic functions of a government are to define and defend property rights, defend against foreign aggression, protect its citizens against each other, and adjudicate disputes, within its border. If it isn't allowed to assume a border, the necessary qualifier for all those functions would vanish.

Neither do I have a problem with it. But how would you achieve this ideal? It's easy to just state an ideal.

"I own a 1200D and have the kit lens with it (18-55mm f3.5-5.6) and it's alright, but in low light, it's horrible, and I'd like to have a bigger depth of field too, because the aperture on the lens I have makes it difficult for a nice depth of field.

I also want to use this camera for video shots, and although it's not the best camera for videos, I'm better off working with what I have to gain experience before stepping it up.

I was thinking about getting the 50mm f1.4, it's a decent price, 100 euros, and it seems like a really good lens, although it doesn't have a longer focal length.

78	"&gt;What are you looking for from me?

You chose to link the definition of a product recall to me. I asked why. You said Apple doesn't do recalls. I pointed out that they tried to avoid this when possible but had recalled in the past. You said that the fact that they had not recalled the butterfly keyboard defects because it is not a safety issue. I pointed out that I agreed with this, but nothing would stop Apple from issuing a recall on the butterfly keyboard if they saw fit, and choosing whether or not to do any sort of out-of-warranty replacement/repair policy was their choice.

&gt;The language Apple chooses to use is combed over by lawyers and I‚Äôm sure they are good ones.

No kidding. Most multibillion dollar electronics companies have good legal advice.

&gt;Apple didn‚Äôt design it to fail

Doesn't mean that a defect doesn't exist. GM didn't design their ignition to be defective, Fitbit didn't design the Fitbit Surge to cause Allergic reactions. NVIDIA didn't design the G84/G86 GPUs to fail either, but they did, and Apple and other manufacturers did extended repair policies (outside of a formal recall) on them.

&gt;there are external factors that can cause these failures

Of course. However, the number of reports I have heard anecdotally (personally, online, etc.) suggests to me that it isn't just people being abusive. Longtime Mac buyers I know personally who take very good care of their hardware have had issues. Other people ITT report the same, and it's not just reddit - check other forums and news articles.

Apple historically has not admitted to every problem immediately, choosing to ignore some, and then offer extended support on others.

&gt;Apple knows the number of people having the issue vs the sale numbers of each model.

Going back to the lazy Fight club economics example of car recalls (or the real life example of the GM recall), Apple ultimately chooses whether or not they will do extended field service for a product/part, and if it's economically worth it. They may or may not, whether or not an actual problem exists.

This isn't a criticism of Apple individually. The [capacitor plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague) bit a lot of computers and electronics in the 2000s. Most motherboard or other consumer electronics manufacturers chose not to extend coverage, both Apple and elsewhere. [The original time capsule was bit by the capacitor plague](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/19/time_capsule_death/), among other Apple products. While this constituted a legitimate defect (due to the bad caps), Apple generally chose not to service affected products outside the original warranty terms - despite them all being ticking time bombs.

Your original reply was the definition of product recall, for reasons that are still unclear.

I totally agree Apple has not recalled the keyboard, which was the point of my original post (field service actions are cheaper and at your own discretion on how widely you service or if you choose to issue them in the first place).

**EDIT**: Your comment history suggests that you claim to be an Apple tech; if true, then your experience is worth something, but so are the experiences of other techs ([example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8g4pb7/why_isnt_apple_recalling_the_20162017_macbook_pros/dy9fgy8/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8g4pb7/why_isnt_apple_recalling_the_20162017_macbook_pros/dy999rp/))."

117	"So 7 months ago my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me in a terrible way, he's been an asshole, I've basically moved on but he has been strange to me. Last I head from him was when I texted saying ""i wish we could end on better terms"" he replied ""stop talking to me""

Anyways, before we started dating, I had a little fling with his best friend -- very accidental, just happened to like each other a lot, strange situation. It was almost like a ""who do i choose"" situation, but they both were fully aware of the situation, so there was no lying and I feel like, while unfortunate, it wasn't necessarily super immoral. Anyways, we didn't go very far, but during the course of my relationship with ex, we have been good friends.

Break up happens, his best friend is very much there to take care of ex, he acts as a liaison when needed between ex and I. He was a really good guy during break up, cheering ex up, etc.

I see them out the other week, I say hi to the friend and he tells me ex forbids us to speak (Even though I consider him a good friend). Kind of sucks, but whatever.

I see the friend the next week. Ex isn't there. We finally get to talk after 6 months. At first, it is just friendly talk about random stuff, then we get to talk a little bit about how he thought my ex was terrible in the break up and that he is sorry, etc. Then, the drunker we get, the convo evolves into something else. He tells me he misses me, confesses how much he liked me when I was with ex, and that he wants to ask me out in the future when things have calmed down. One thing leads to another and we end up having sex. It was great, and while drunk we say that we want to continue to do this, secretly (obviously not a sober idea).

He texts me the next day saying basically ""that was great. also really terrible, lets forget about it and move on."" I agree. It's fucked up to continue.

I see him out this week. He pretends I don't exist. My issue is that, if you sleep with a friend, yeah, it might be awkward. Maybe there has always been sexual tension and now that we have had sex, he isn't into me anymore. Maybe he just feels too guilty for sleeping with his best friends ex (of course he does). Maybe he thinks saying hi to me will lead to sex again. However, besides all of those perfectly understandable reasons to feel awkward or not want to really speak to me, is it not the decent thing to do, that after you have sex with someone who is supposed to be a friend, can you at least acknowledge them and make eye contact, smile, say hi?? something?

Am I an asshole for sleeping with my exs best friend, after my ex was terrible to me, and after years of liking the guy (I have no real loyalty to my ex anymore, but should I)? Is he an asshole for doing it, since he has always liked me and now I am available, and my ex chose not to be with me? Is he being an asshole to me by not saying hi, or should I be more understanding? Does my ex have every right to forbid us to speak to each other, forbid us being friends?

**tldr; I slept with ex's best friend, we have liked each other forever, but now the best friend is pretending I dont exist. Ex also has forbidden him to speak to me/be friends with me. Ex doesn't know we like eachother. Who is the asshole? Ex, best friend, me? All of us?**"	Lol no, OP you have no need to apologize. Otto really now, this is extremely irresponsible advice.

&gt;The right to live and the right to medication are two entirely different things.

What about a new born with a life threatening illness that can only be treated with life saving medication? 

It also slipped mind that either way you WILL get the medication you need via Medicaid. But having every asset and valuable stripped away from you, just so you can live another day is wrong, at least in my opinion.  



&gt;Do you have a right to the Advil or Mucinex at your local Walgreens? Now, I could see a very strong argument for people to have the right to *access* medication. What I mean is, I don't think people have a *right* to most private industry products and services. For example, you don't have a right to buy a Samsung TV. If they decide they don't want to sell TVs this week, tough titties. If the electronics store owner simply doesn't like you, so be it. I can see where we'd want to say ""Biogen, you *cannot* refuse to sell your product to someone"". But I don't see how we can fairly say ""Biogen, you have to sell your product for X price because we say so"".

I completely agree. 

 &gt;Believe it or not, even a product like a life saving medication is subject to price elasticity and can't simply be raised indefinitely.

This is where you're wrong. When your life is on the line, you do whatever it takes. Nothing is too expensive when it's life or death



&gt; Companies want to maximize profit, not simply price items as high as they possibly can. 

Not the pharmaceutical companies we're discussing. The companies we're discussing raised prices ‚Äì not to fund research to discover new drugs ‚Äì but to boost profits for executives and investors. In essence, they operated more like hedge funds than traditional pharmaceutical companies. Then these same companies bought critical life-saving drugs made by one manufacturer and then worked to keep competitors out. Valeant for example raised prices on 2 life saving drugs(Cuprimine and Syprine) from $500 (which was already profitable for a standard pharmaceutical company) to $24,000 for a 30-day supply.

&gt;Do companies have a ""monopoly"" over a specific product? Sure, that's the entire point of patents - to allow temporary total control over a product *you* created. That doesn't constitute an industry monopoly which would require govt intervention. In fact, it's quite silly to think about considering govt intervention is entirely what a patent is!

I agree.

143	"Im not sure if you are still answering questions, but in the hopes you are, I have a few I'd absolutely love to hear your opinion on. Im having a bit of a hard time nailing down a specific question, but if you have any thoughts on the subject I very much like to hear them.

First off, im familiar enough with machine learning, but it isnt my main area of expertise. My overall thoughts on machine learning are ""great, as long as you have a stationary set of events."" in short: ""you a want a machine that can handle these events, you get enough data on those events, and you train it.

What id love to hear your opinion on is: what about the non-stationary events. What about something it has never seen before. How can you train a machine to correctly deal with something it wasnt trained on / to ""handle the unexpected""?

From my point of view, it sort of seems like this is a bit of a glass ceiling in current machine learning research, as there is a fundamental difference between ""teaching a machine to teach itself how to do a specific task or set of tasks"" and ""teaching a machine to teach itself how to learn"". (personally I suspect that quantum computing is probably required to make the latter actually feasible, but that is a whole other topic).

Based on what Ive heard from a few different sources, it sounds like a lot of places are almost making backward progress on this, and are basically using the ""shotgun' approach to try things without any thought of *why* they should or shouldnt work, and then choosing whatever works for the task at hand without any thought as to what happens when it encounters a task it wasnt trained for."	"How could it *not* be? The Earth still generates a bit of heat even ignoring human activity (producing best from past collected energy), from it's hot core.

* Auburn +4 (@Ole Miss): This line is too low (should be at least 7) and is a clear overreaction to Auburn's loss to Tennessee. Yes Auburn's offense has been anemic at times lately, but Ole Miss is the perfect prescription for a struggling offense (especially with the # of injuries Ole Miss has had on defense) and Auburn's defense is still insanely good (#2 overall defense on S&amp;P+) and going against an Ole Miss offense that just lost WR DK Metcalf for season. You should take this line before it moves even further this week (I got it at -3 when it opened yesterday).
* Nebraska -3.5/4 (Minnesota): Two reasons I really like this spread. First, when Martinez is healthy Nebraska has played at a much higher level than their record might indicate, and Nebraska really should have beaten both Colorado and @Northwestern from a win expectancy standpoint. Second, and I refer to this as ""trench warfare theory"": teams are more likely to struggle the week after facing Ohio State/Clemson/Alabama, and my theory has always been the OL gets worn out through attrition (along with probably getting hyped up for a big game and giving it your all etc. etc.). Some examples of this include Syracuse (lost 44-37 @Pitt after their close loss @Clemson), Texas A&amp;M (followed up their loss @Alabama with an ugly 24-17 win over Arkansas), Arkansas (after playing well against Alabama they blew the lead in the 4Q this week at home to Ole Miss), TCU (followed their loss to Ohio State by losing decisively 31-16 @Texas), and Indiana (Played pretty well in a 49-26 loss @tOSU, and then was murdered by Iowa this week 42-16). Minnesota is good, and the line is pretty much spot-on value wise as these two teams are about even overall, but I like Nebraska in this spot.
* Michigan -7 (@Michigan State):  Yes Dantonio is scary, yes Michigan State has been unpredictable, and yes, MSU's ATS is insane against Michigan the last 10 years or so. That said, this line should be -10. Michigan is just a much better team this year, with a suffocating defense (best in country) that really only seems to surrender points in the first 3 drives of a given game before completely clamping down, and Michigan State doesn't have enough firepower on offense to make this a close game (the loss of White really hurts as they used to have two true #1s with Felton Davis/Cody White and Darrell Stewart is still out, RB LJ Scott still isn't back, and the OL is still banged up). MSU's defense has largely been lights out against the run this year - as they are most year - with one of their specialities being an infamous safety double a-gap run blitz Narduzzi crafted awhile back. But the downside of having the extra emphasis on the run game is space is opened up for TEs/H-Backs that are either man-free or largely unaccounted for outside a soft zone, and few teams have utilized their collection of HBs and TEs as well in the passing game as Michigan has this year. We already saw Northwestern take advantage of this in their 29-19 win against Michigan State in how they utilized their split-back Cameron Green. Michigan State was also +4.1 on their turnover margin against Penn State and really won more so on Penn State's own blunders than Michigan State being a consistent threat offensively. Finally, even with this team's unpredictability, I don't see Michigan State being able to bring their Dantonio special back to back weeks - Last year Michigan State beat Penn State 27-24 in a close game and then lost 48-3 the next week @Ohio State, and similarly, last year the won @Michigan 14-10 before barely holding on @Minnesota in a 30-27 win. So I get while going against Michigan State/Dantonio is scary, but Michigan +7 is just great value.
* Fresno State -14 (@New Mexico): I take Fresno State almost every week, and probably will continue to take them every week until Vegas finally makes them the 20+ point favorite they should be against most of their conference opponents. Fresno State just plays lights out defense week in and week out.

&amp;#x200B;"	"There's a few things at play with USF. 

The programs success with filling the stadium in 2007 shows the interest is there. However, the prolonged terrible seasons turned off a lot of fans. Attendance wasn't *terrible* last year but you expect more butts in seats after the team wins 11 games the year before. Now that they've posted back to back 10 win seasons, maybe the success will continue to bring in the casual fan.  Losing that public perception of being in a 'power 5' conference doesn't help. 


Part of the issue with attendance has also been time of games. The AACs desire to have games on primetime weekday slots on ESPN means some teams (such as USF a lot of the past couple seasons) have played games on Thursday or Friday nights. These are still work nights for some people or these are weeknights where there are student events or clubs or Greek things going on. Not a lot of people want to go to a USF game at 7-8pm, leave around 10-11 or later, then not get home on a weekday until midnight almost between commute and traffic. 

I reckon a lot of complaint with Raymond James is also the general decor and feel. The red seats don't really scream USF and is frequently the butt of many jokes rather than seats.  They put a banner up over the Bucs banners but it doesn't *feel* like home. 

Being closer or actually on campus mainly benefits student access. The student section typically turns out well and is sometimes dependant on Greek life (for example recruitment is the first couple weekends of school, directly clashing with attending games). Being within walking distance or a 10 minute shuttle ride across campus is much more favorable than paying 20 bucks to park and drive and such, not to mention those without a vehicle to do so. 

Location wise, Ray Jay is sort of ""better"" in Tampa, it has a lot of major roads nearby so the infrastructure is better. But it's also not really 'home', and I think that's what matters. "	CFB	CFB	-1
148	"Me (25M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been dating for 3 years. Just before out 1 year anniversary we had a 3 month break and we got back together. The reason for getting back together was that I felt like that all the reason we broke up were resolved.

I feel like I‚Äôm at the end of the straw now though. Everything we talk about is to do with our friends getting married and how we have been dating for a while longer and still not engaged. Just to mention we decided not to have sex or move in together until we are married just out of a commitment to each other. I am dying too though, haha.

A month or two ago she said we need to start having serious relationship talks and I do agree. I‚Äôve been actively looking at houses and wanting to take her to open homes (she always pulls out), but I go and I get into the mindset of looking for just me. I‚Äôve started to be way more open about my financial position and what exactly I‚Äôm bringing to the relationship and potential marriage ‚Äì this included what I‚Äôm earning and what I‚Äôm exactly saving each month. I‚Äôve even had meetings with the banks to help get all unnecessary spending reduced, I thought I‚Äôm doing the right responsible thing. She was upset. Telling her my meetings with the banks about home loans and saving, but I hadn‚Äôt mentioned to the bank about saving up for an engagement ring. She didn‚Äôt think any of it matters until I actually proposed.

This leaves me with eh feeling like she wants to be engaged or married because of everyone else, her life plan or the sake of being married.

She‚Äôs also unwilling to share her financial position and talk openly about what bills she pays 'because that‚Äôs private'.

Yesterday we‚Äôd had another one of these conversations about how we had serious things to talk about. But I don‚Äôt honestly know what that is. To expand more she doesn‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôs taken care of, to which I don‚Äôt get.

I feel like I pay for everything, which I don‚Äôt mind doing, but when she makes a point about not being taken care of, it makes me upset.

Of course I want a deeper dive into a game before reviews, but the ""review in progress"" format they have went to for quite a few games has rubbed me the wrong way, where they constantly update the front page every time an entry is made, even if it's a minor update, just to draw page views.

So I don't read IGN much anymore so I have no personal experience with this.

But doesn't that make sense? Would you rather they just put their ""Review in progress"" on the front page once and then after it gets updated or finalized it doesn't go up again?

&gt; Did you have at least one project with ~50k LOC and at least 3 devs working on it for 3+ years?

I'm really interested in this and am even considering doing a larger survey about this since I have a feeling that most developers advocating against static typing simply haven't worked on large enough projects to see the benefits it provides and the problems you no longer have.

IMO static typing isn't even for preventing run-time exceptions, but more for documenting the business logic in code and being able to navigate/refactor code easily. Tests do help with refactoring as well, but why choose one when you can have both.

Only a subset of maintainability issues come from a lack of static typing, so there's no wonder statically typed codebases still have issues."

As for the first part, people's standards on what counts as violence/reasonable peaceful protest are always iffy.

Similarly, I can imagine people in the 60's thinking that freedom riders were performing crimes by committing ""trespassing, unlawful assembly, and violating state and local Jim Crow laws"" and should instead have just followed the law by holding a legally sanctioned, orderly demonstration.

But towards the end of Saturday and the entirety of Sunday, it somehow fixed, probably by luck, I had just dialed the perfect AFFA adjustment for my distance.

When you say that ""it probably just happens that this man-made concept is objectively true"" you give away the core of the argument.  On naturalism it's just lucky that math applies, but on theism the reason is that the universe was designed to be fundamentally intelligible.  I don't think this is Craig's strongest argument.  I think an atheist can make a pretty good case that it's just impossible for any universe to exist where math doesn't apply.  I don't know what that argument is, it's not obvious to me, but I don't think this could be as strong long term as the cosmological argument you respond to in the second part of your post.

Hey, thanks for engaging with me and being polite.  I hope I was fine for you, and that this exchange was a positive experience."	"I like this post. I think you should look into some of the philosophy of the American Founding Fathers, Especially James Madison. This is why I follow deism.

Madison was the primary author of the Constitution. For centuries, the contemporary thought was that Gods by their will, granted Kings and queens to rule. The kings and queens then treated their constituents as property, or rentals from god. 

Thus religion was often used as a tool for their political and Machiavellian objectives. Think about Charlameign getting the title of Holy Roman Emperor and using it as a badge of authority to conquer land. Or think Henry the 8th basically creating a new form of Christianity. People think he did this just so he could get married, but what he really did was cut the papal influence from Britain and give himself a larger influence over the British people since he was not only their King, but basically their pope now.

As you can see, religion was not absolute and the rules and customs could easily change as the ruler saw fit. But what the founding fathers and especially Madison noticed was that religion was flawed, but the idea of Theism was not. Kings and religions had too much power and the ability to change. But Madison took a Deistic approach that said philosophically, god exists. And God gave rights (life, liberty, and property) to man. We are going to write a constitution that protects these rights by outlining the rules and procedures that the government must follow. Oh, and by the way, there is a separation of church and state. So now you can't have government officials select one religion to rule them all.

So even though the constitution can change, the concept of God giving rights to all individuals (rather than Kings and religious leaders) is concrete. Due process of the law must be used before these rights can be taken away by the government. Not saying due process always works correctly, but we can always look back and retroactively change the outcomes of supreme court cases with new rulings that are not clouded by the obviously flawed cultural (or religious) beliefs of the past."

"As much as I dislike parts of GW2, this is just wrong. Max levels comes around the end of the base game. Even when looking at pure story content there are now also two big expansions of story missions and two seasons of smaller story missions with a third in progress, so there's way more story to be had after max level. Like 3/4 of the game's story comes after max level.

If we compare this to the other topic about good endgame, this is like Pokemon Gold and Sun's second half after the credits, and that was an example of good endgame according to the other topic, so it's unfair to ignore that here.

So that was the ""unrepeatable"" content in the sense that it's kinda boring when you know what's going to happen.

At some point content is going to repeat. If we look at repeatable content, stuff that you do multiple times for rewards, that would be comparable to for example World of Warcraft Path of Exile from the ""good endgame"" topic, where you can create new characters or builds, farm instanced areas, raids.

All of these are in GW2 too. With condition builds being good now (where they were terrible on release) and with the expansions giving all classes new mechanics there are many ways to play professions so there's definitely reason and fun to be had in levelling new professions or builds you haven't tried before.

There's still the dungeons from the core game, and fractals expand on them by making them a bit more random to keep things interesting. Then another step up is to do raids.

And then on the completionist side (unrepeatable) there are so many fun achievements that have you explore entire zones for things you probably skipped over before.

Of course you'll eventually get bored, but that goes for all games from the ""good endgame"" topic. But your point that there's nothing to do after max level is just absurdly wrong."	Games	Games	-1

So if you want your physics to be accurate at higher speeds you need to use Einsteins laws of general relativity instead of Newtons laws. This makes things much more complicated but more accurate. The threshold for when you switch away from classical physics and to relativistic physics depends on your application. However a good rule of thumb is around 10% the speed of light.	This is so true.

First off: you seem like a genuine bad-ass-m*therf*cker. Do you miss those days or are you grateful for having survived?

I recently began entertaining the possibility of pursuing photojournalism and fashion photography; my inner cynic is telling me that the future for journalism looks bleak - in a sense. Journalists are receiving less compensation, less protection, and so on...  Any thoughts?

What are your thoughts on the current vs the past state of journalism &amp; photo-journalism? What are your opinions about people such as Sebastian Junger, Tim Hetherington, Don McCullin, Marie Colvin &amp; Paul Conroy, etc.?

I'm left with the impression that the state of today's journalism is completely different than what it was yesterday. It all seems quite romanticized -- in hindsight.

When they nerf trist, I‚Äôll just start playing xayah and Varus who I think are just as strong, if not stronger, than trist right now. 

In my opinion she can take the range nerf to make her have to step up more in lane and make her more vulnerable to poke. But that combined with other nerfs will force her out of play completely. Combined with the range nerf I could easily see the E resetting jump getting removed, and E damage on the tower being nerfed.

207	It's so nice to see a school investing into esports and not excluding SC2! Just for that I hope you guys are successful.	"&gt; There are so many possibilities of GO the theory is there isn't enough time for humans to realistically play out every potential. So in this sense with an AI you can have it try trillions of variations in such little time its scary.

AlphaGo does not consider trillions of possibilities. It has learned a positional understanding/intuition from seeing how positions play out. The original combined supervised training using expert games with Reinforcement Learning based on self-play using self-guided Monte Carlo search/sampling. The newest version, AlphaZero, was trained solely from self-play, and achieved the strongest results ever in Go, Chess and Shogi. Interestingly, when playing chess against Stockfish, AZ evaluated less than 100'000 positions every second, whereas Stockfish evaluated like two thousand times more. AZ had learned a better evaluation function, and was able to waste much less time on considering less promising branches.

Having unlimited Actions Per Minute is useless if the actions are not well-considered. Even in simple Atari games, RL agents are often trained with frameskip (unconditional input repetition) to reduce the complexity. Anyhow, when Deepmind take on the challenge of SC2, they will obviously not want to be seen as cheaters who use a superhuman action rate. They take on the game from a perspective that closely resembles ours. Full fog of war, acting through a movable view etc.

Starcraft is complex in many ways that Go is not. Namely with high interaction rate (and merciless opponents that don't wait), vast and continuous action space, indirect and incomplete access to game state (imperfect information) and indirect access to the full action space (through movable view). All of this complicates planning, which will have to abstract away a lot of the dimensionality while building and maintaining an essential understanding of the game. There is also resource acquisition and allocation, and (as in board games) strategy and tactics (in SC2 possibly even including multiplayer alliances).

Solving (beating the best humans in) SC2 by self-play would be a major milestone for AI, and I would frankly tremble in my pants if that were to happen any time soon."	starcraft	starcraft	-1

I've had experiences I would call transcendent, or numinous in the sense of ""appealing to the higher emotions or to the aesthetic sense"" as Merriam-Webster puts it.

Religious people often testify to having experiences, of for example nature, or human connection, that somehow verify to them that God exists and/or a religion is true. For me, I have the same experiences of being awe-inspired by nature, or music, or being enraptured by a connection with another human, but these experiences have no connection to the existence of God or the truth of a religion. 

If you believe God is real and is known through spiritual experience, why do I (and millions of others) have no such experience?

Essence Make Me Brow -- Also pigmented, adds just enough color to emphasize hairs without being too heavy. Small brush is easy to handle without getting excess product on skin. Can't beat the price.

I first of started as a pve player, doing dungeons regularly, then fractals when they came out.

My mesmer became my main (and is still is).

 About six months ago i started doing a lot of WvW, i wanted to get legendary armor for my mesmer (because I always want to try out a new build but I never manage to get enough gold to be able to change of build, and I've never been a huge PVP player so I tend not to try new builds there, I still am and will ever be a PVE player). 

After getting from rank 50 to around 220 in a short period of time (2 or 3 months) i got a bit tired of it so I turned to PVP for the first time. I got to low gold (despite since how long i've been playing I'm not very good at this game but i play to enjoy, not being good so I've never been bothered too much by that) but I couldn't really play lately (I was on vacations) so I got degraded to bronze.

280	"&gt; Too much body hair? Just don't shave it, lots of men don't, it's much more acceptable for men than for women.

I am a literal gorilla. Not shaving is actually not an option for me because it's *physically uncomfortable*. That's not even including the shame that even my *best* partners have (even unintendedly) caused by commenting on it and making it into a deal (which I can't even blame them for, because it's not like *I* enjoy giving oral while picking hair out of my teeth). 

&gt;Periods and childbirth aren't exactly the extent of inconvenience for women, there's also greater risk of sexual assault (and all the precautions you need to take as a result)...

I'm a two time sexual assault survivor. I recognize that, statistically, women are 3 times more likely to be assaulted than men, but I don't feel comfortable making comparisons on that front, which is why I didn't bring it up. 

&gt;fluctuating hormones, being more prone to UTIs, etc...

This is genuinely something that I don't have to deal with that I would start having to if I could wave a wand. Not really much to say there, you're right that guys don't really have to deal with that (although, as a person with chronic depression, I still don't have the easiest time with hormones). 

&gt;Seriously, it's not even close, the vast majority of people of any gender would tell you that being male is infinitely more ""convenient"".

To be fair, I didn't actually say that women's lives were ""more convenient"" in my post. I made it a point not to make that comparison, because I don't think I have that right. I just stated that being a man IS inconvenient in the ways I described. Would it be less so in those *specific* ways? Probably, but not in others. Which is why I didn't make the comparison. 

&gt;The SO's orgasms don't seem to hold a candle to mine, even though he seems completely satisfied. 

And, honestly, this is a big complaint of mine. It takes SO. MUCH. MORE. EFFORT. to give a man the quality of orgasm that women can get from even a cheap $20 bullet vibrator, to say nothing of what you can get from a really good partner. It's not a contest. Women get the better O because their bodies are physiologically different, and after a while, that starts to get frustrating, especially when it's INCREDIBLY rare to find a female partner who values being an exceptional partner. Because, women just need ""good"" male partners (or good female ones, if they're bi or lesbian). Men need *exceptional* female partners, though, because our sex organs lack a lot of the versatility that women's have and our brains require more varied stimulation (on the whole, not in all cases). 

"	I was 20 when I lost my virginity.  I was overweight and shy.  I had lots of guy friends, but no one wanted to date me.  One of my friends brought home a buddy of his from the Marines and we hit it off great. He was so good looking. He paid so much attention to me that night, and made me feel so attractive.  I remember thinking that a person like him shouldn't even be paying attention to someone ugly and disgusting like me.  I figured, it won't get better than this, at least I can have this one night.  I drank a lot!!!  We did it.  I don't remember anything except feeling empty the next day.  Anyway, that aside, if I could go back and do it again, I would have waited for someone I knew, someone who cared about me at least.

He blocked me from everything. I knew he needed to do it to move on, but I still wanted him in my life. I felt selfish for being hurt. I was the one who dumped him. I caused him to be sad, to be in pain.

Even when I started seeing my now husband, I was still not over it. I would cry myself to sleep every night. I carried this guilt of hurting and losing my best friend and it was the biggest pain of my life.

326	"Bear in mind that we also heard similar warnings just before the Financial Crisis market meltdown in 2008.  That happened to be an economic bullet which the Fed and U.S. dodged.  The reason we've been hearing warnings since 2008 is that Congress and the Fed never fixed the systemic problems that culminated in that major economic threat.  Instead, they kicked long overdue economic and fiscal legislative reforms down the road and created an even bigger threat.  This ""negligence"" was caused by financial industry and special interest group lobbying efforts and outright bribery/extortion.  

Long story shot, we're staring at an even bigger systemic threat now than the country faced in 2008.  Take a cold, hard look at [long-term market cap trends](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DDDM01USA156NWDB).  If one were to extrapolate long-term market growth trends and compare where the market would naturally be to where it happens to be, we can get a good sense of the financial pain on the horizon.  The gap between these points is largely Fed monopoly money and speculative hype.  The correction which the market is staring at is going to land with a sickening thud.

He had a whole trove of souvenirs from Egypt and Russia etc. I think he'd been saving up for years until he met someone.

331	"&gt;You are clearly still struggling with the dilemma as you are going back and forth between greater good justification and divine command. I am sorry that in order to protect your closely held beliefs you have resorted to defending slavery, genocide, and religious discrimination.

Thank you. Your pity really means a lot to me. Unfortunately, it may be misplaced as there is no dilemma on my end with regards to greater good and divine command. You just seem unable to understand my position which, if I'm being charitable, is probably due to my inability to explain it clearly, but I'll continue to try nonetheless.

&gt;God could have brought eternal salvation to humanity without slavery and genocide. 

How do you know this?

&gt;Then why pick Hitler instead of a random person? I suspect because you wanted to soften the evil of divine command theory.

The Hitler example is relevant because if God told you in 1908 that you should kill a random, struggling artist, you would accuse God of being evil. 

&gt;Under divine command theory you can justify any evil act and it makes your reasoning no different then the 9/11 hijackers.

Correct. The ""*reasoning*"" is no different from the 9/11 hijackers. However, I don't believe that it was God's will that they fly those planes into the twin towers.

&gt;Again, this would mean that slavery, genocide, and child sacrifice are good. 

These things don't become good in the abstract. God abhors child sacrifice as the old testament clearly states but he'll specifically command it from Abraham because he wants to test him. If God commands a genocide, then it is good. If a dictator decides on his own apart from God that he wants to commit a genocide, then it is evil. God doesn't need to follow the rules that he gave us. If you think this is unjust, then go ahead, be my guest, and hold God accountable.

&gt;Which means there is a possible world where Hitler didn't kill millions of people. And God chose not to create that world.

No, the possible world where Hitler doesn't kill millions of people was Hitler's decision to make. Not God's.

&gt;And now you are defending anti-semitism.

What defense? I'm literally answering your question. You asked me ""do you feel it was easier or more difficult to convince his citizens to participate in the Holocaust after centuries of anti-Semitic rhetoric preached from the pulpits of the Catholic church?"" and I basically answered yes with the clarification that members of the church practiced anti-Judaism, which was religion based, not race-based like Nazi antisemitism, but regardless, it did make antisemitism easier in Nazi Germany.

**Look. I get it. You think I'm a close-minded asshole and your anger is making it difficult to understand my position. But could you at least try to treat this like a clinical, dispassionate examination of the psyche of a religious person. You're so ready to confirm your own preconceptions of me that you can't even read what I wrote carefully enough to see that I am agreeing with you.**

&gt;So God could have punished them for slavery but didn't.

Let me reemphasize that there is a difference between what God permits and what God actively wills. God may allow things that he doesn't want, to achieve an end. He permits divorce but he did not want it to be the end design goal. He permitted that Israel have a King even though it went against his will and he warned them that they would be worse off with a human king. God only knows to what end or purpose slavery could have served but he permitted it nonetheless. Idolatry, the worship of false gods, served no purpose in God's eyes and he must have seen it as very harmful to the Israelites which is why he punished them for it.

&gt;Yet he takes away Pharaoh's free will in Exodus by hardening his heart.

I don't believe that Pharaoh had his free will taken away. But if you want to tell me that my reading of scripture is wrong and you're right, knock yourself out.

&gt;I do not use that definition of omnipotence.

What is your definition? Because you asked me if God is omnipotent or not so based off your definition, I will answer that question.

&gt;Your description of God seems to be utterly useless a standard of moral behavior.

If you're saying that ""God's will"" is useless as a ""general standard"" of moral behavior, then yes I'd agree with you. God rarely makes his will in specific instances explicit and so relying on ""God's will,"" i.e. expecting and waiting for God to reveal to you what you should do in every moment of your life, is both useless and does not happen generally. This is why he gave the Israelites the Mosaic law, which they would use to govern themselves until the coming of Jesus, who instituted the New Covenant, which superseded and overwrote the Mosaic law.

&gt;Extradition does not equal eternal torture.

Are you being deliberately obtuse? Of course they're not equal. It's an analogy. "	They assert nature, but all nature does in give evidence of some sort of god.

359	"I stand corrected! You're quite right that there seems to be misinformation regarding Nixon and Drug Policy. Thanks for enlightening me!

That said, I still stand by the original point that especially regarding drug legislation that there certainly seemed to be if not racial bias at the very least racial consequence:

Sentencing disparities

In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking or possession of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine,[71][72][73][74] which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.[75] This 100:1 ratio had been required under federal law since 1986.[76] Persons convicted in federal court of possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine received a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years in federal prison. On the other hand, possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine carries the same sentence.[72][73] In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act cut the sentencing disparity to 18:1.[75]

According to Human Rights Watch, crime statistics show that‚Äîin the United States in 1999‚Äîcompared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.[77]

Statistics from 1998 show that there were wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.[72] Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races,[78] even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.[72]"	"I think it paints a bit of a different picture when you look at income per person instead of income per household. When looking at average income per person in Australia it's about almost 79k for a full time employee before bonuses. (http://www.abs.gov.au). 

Where as in Canada it's more like 52k.  (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171130/dq171130b-eng.htm).

It also paints a different picture when looking at minumum wage living in Canada where minmum wage ranges from $10.96-$14.00 an hour. Where as in Australia it's  $17.70/hour which very few jobs except the banana farms pay. Even McDonald's is paying $20+ an hour plus superannuation (which no company in Canada is required to pay). 

On top of this post secondary is subsidised for 90% of students and any loans that are taken out don't need to be paid back until you make 52k per year. 

All that being said Canada is expensive but it's not as insane as everyone makes it out to be. With the exception of the telecom industry and real estate withing 150km of major cities.

It wouldn't be weird. Seeing his face rather what he's looking at is a common tool to create suspense because we don't know what he's scared at.

Usually in anime if a character is scared because he said shit about another character behind him, he would freeze like Eren but side-eyeing said character.

387	"I don't think that would be a good argument either. But, I hope you know, that this argument is not based on the Bible, but is used by Christians who are unable to answer the question why God does not reveal himself to some people. 

The average Christian does not have all the answers. 

The thing I can only emphasize is that one is not saved through knowledge in the existence of God. As we often like to quote James 2:19, even the devils believe that God exists. 

You are saved by faith, loyalty to Christ, following him. He is the way to the Father. Noone can come to the Father but through him. Jesus reveals to us who God is. 

But these revelations go hand in hand with being asked to follow. All the times God reveals himself to people like Mary or Abraham or Moses, the Prophets...it is always with a purpose, a task for them. Not just so that they know him and be saved. The times God reveals himself just to be known (e.g. with Pharao and the Egypts) are usually times where they will feel God's wrath and judgement.

Now our only quest is to follow Christ. So if you want to have a revelation of God's love, then there is no way around Jesus."	Mainly because most Christians never read their Bibles. If they go/went to mass/church/Bible studies/catechism/etc they learn a very reduced and biased outlook on the Bible. Most of their learning would be from people who ignore the more complicated/awful/etc passages and concentrate in whatever specifics they want to impart, and this happens because they don't actually want to teach the awful stuff, because they don't want to deal with difficult stuff or because their ruling institution has been tamed through centuries of enlightenment and thus it wouldn't fly.

Overall I think if you have the skill and talent, 100% cook for them. If you burn cereal, you should probably just go out. But if its aight/is still edible but not fantastic or anything, then it shows that you purposefully put time into trying to hone your skills to impress, and the impression is a lot more meaningful than just blowing money, imo. 
Not to mention, fancy restaurants never did it for me. I don‚Äôt really like small talk and fancy places make me feel out of place. A modest steakhouse/diner is way better to get to know someone because you know all the other faux rich people aren‚Äôt judging your conversation.

OP probably also has trouble finding friends, as a lot of perfectly normal people do. 

OP considers herself more socially aware than her roommate and I would go as far as to say she is *too* aware. Maybe OP has anxiety over what other people think of her; so she gravitates towards this roommate who loves her like a golden retriever and will never judge her. 

Just my thoughts as someone who went through a similar situation."	"I agree that such a representation of men is also sexist and I wouldn't go for it if I was a CEO.

"If we're talking semantics then from what I understand and what Wikipedia has the nomen (Julius) is a larger unit than we would typically use in the modern West to mean a family, hence the use of ""clan."" So it has the Julii *clan* not family. The cognomen (Caesar) began as nicknames but took on the meaning of a smaller branch of the nomen that would be more like our sense of ""family"" within a larger clan. And since there were relatively few praenomen they were less useful as identifying characteristics except for people close to you, which is why they abbreviated Caius to ""C.""

""During the period of the Roman Republic, the praenomen and nomen represented the essential elements of the name; the cognomen first appeared among the Roman aristocracy at the inception of the Republic, but was not widely used among the plebeians, who made up the majority of the Roman people, until the second century BC. Even then, not all Roman citizens bore cognomina, and until the end of the Republic the cognomen was regarded as somewhat less than an official name. By contrast, in imperial times the cognomen became the principal distinguishing element of the Roman name, and although praenomina never completely vanished, the essential elements of the Roman name from the second century onward were the nomen and cognomen.""

Yield = Weight of Flesh without Seed / Weight of Flesh and Seed Combined

465	"Ma'am. With as much respect as I can muster, she did and does know more that you.

Now, you can say that because she has a degree in dealing with microorganisms that she may be a tad zealous in response to knowing exactly how dangerous they can be.  I know that once you see the effects of something like polio (which wasn't unusual to see in the mountains where I grew up) you can get a bit stubborn about the risk involved in not vaccinating for that kind of thing. 

Eliminating polio and smallpox was a major effort. They're no longer in the list of things we have to worry about for the most part. Except in places where vaccines never wiped out the pool of it in the population.

Anybody that's dealt with a nasty bug asking sweeping through an isolated population also gets rather upset at idiots that don't even understand what vaccines are, how they're made, or even how they work in the body screwing up herd immunity for the rest of the world.

Now, I get it. Things like the flu that mutate rapidly and rely on predicting which strains to attack are a bit less important than things like , I dunno, measles that could be potentially eradicated.   But if you've never seen the flu run through a nursing home killing patients, you might never think about the possibility of it being something to worry about. 

If you've never seen that kind of thing, or studied it, there's no way to have the perspective to evaluate the risks and rewards of the subject of vaccination.

And without at least a little bit of training, self education is difficult. You can't trust regular media outlets for education, and actually reading the original studies is hard enough if you do have the training to understand them. And that's assuming you know how and where to find them.

Of course, that's why most people find someone that *can* do those tasks. Like maybe a close relative that's got a degree in a relevant field like, I dunno, biology or microbiology, and pay attention to them.

But hey, I'm going to stop digging at you.

If your sister did try to educate you on the subject, for a month, and your reaction was that her education as ""just"" her saying she knows more than you, have you considered that you throwing the typical arguments against vaccination at someone with the training to actually understand the original studies and experiments might be a wee bit insulting to her?

Think about that.  She's doing her best to give you information that's as up to date and accurate as possible. She's spent years studying *exactly* what you're talking about.  And the arguments you use are not even actual evidence, no real data gathered, just parroting whatever layman's source you've decided to use.

That month she spent doing her best was also a month she spent getting told by her sister that she was an idiot, being insulted over and over again. 

And since you phrased it as ""the reason she knew more than me"" is a darn good indicator of how you were looking at the situation. There's this thing that people do when confronted with something that goes against what they believe. They tend to decide that their belief is correct, and that anyone  that is using logic and facts to say otherwise is speaking down to them, or trying to be better than them. It prevents the person from actually considering that they might be wrong.

In turn, those people tend to become more defensive, more angry and often even directly insulting rather than just passively so.

Maybe your sister didn't cut you off because you didn't vaccinate your kids. Maybe she did it because  you ceased to be a thinking person, a loving sister that values the sibling in front of you, and acted like she was questioning your religion. You probably got more and more irate that she would dare try to say anything about your decision for your kids *instead of maybe listening to someone that loves you trying to also protect them from harm*.

Yeah, I'd have sent the same letter she did probably. Actually, I'm a jerk, so I would have spelled out exactly what I thought of someone that utterly insulted me and everything I'd worked towards. And I'd have probably called you names at that. I'm a jerk. Once I've figured out that someone is a backwards, non thinking fool, I give up on being polite and take the opportunity to let loose my inner butthole.

Did she do any of that? Throw insults unrelated to the specific subject?  Tell you you were a hopeless troglodyte? Spew hatred and venom? If she did, you're better off with her gone.

If she didn't, then maybe it's you that screwed up.

In your post you asked what you could do to fix the situation.

At this point, I doubt you'll welcome any advice from me simply because I've  been condescending and harsh. But I'll give it just in case.

If you want to patch things up. Send her copies of this exchange. Print it out, forward it through email, whatever. Tell her this a-hole on the internet  just spent way more time than is healthy throwing barbs at you for not vaccinating and being a jerk to her.

Then ask her if I'm right about the way you made her feel.  Tell her that if that is true, you're sorry. Tell her that you love her and want to try and move past it. 

If she is, *then* you explain how you felt. Then you either ask that this single subject be off limits, or you ask her to explain the science behind her arguments again. And if she agrees to do so, you listen. Remember that she isn't some faceless drone, she's your sister and isn't trying to belittle you.

I'd bet that at some point in all that, she'll tell you she missed you and loves you. She may even apologize for any of the hurtful things she said or did (I would hope so, just because she was right doesn't mean she had to be a jerk about it).

Otherwise, just leave it as it is. If you can't face having been wrong, you can't expect her to either."	Yipes!  Get away from him before he re-triggers you.  He is not safe for you to be around.

530	"Here's a long-winded answer you weren't asking for!

In most Jurisdictions, they ask you if you believe in a supreme being. You need to be able to say yes, but there's not a requirement for what that looks like to you. That's why my Lodge has Jews, Christians, deists, and a smattering of anything else you could think up. 

Now, on its face - it can sound like a shitty thing to have as a requirement. But, then we need to talk about the aims of ""Mainline American"" Freemasonry. It's a part of Masonry we're bad at talking about with non-Masons. Keep in mind - I'm not judging you for not having a faith. You do you.

After a lot of thought on this, I think to let an Athiest join would be bad for the Athiest. Freemasonry isn't a religion (Far from it) - but out rituals do an excellent job of making you think about your faith. Not in a ""You should think of your faith like this"" way, but it helps you develop a set of tools to explore your particular relationship to deity. 

Sounds weird? Kinda, but you'd need to have gone through the ritual for it not to. And in many ways, that's the point. 

By letting an Athiest join, I feel like we would be handing them a set of tools and then asking them to build something they don't need or want for that matter. Atheists don't need to think about a relationship to a deity because they don't have one. So really, we'd be setting that person up for failure. 

What I'm talking about is just one part of being a Mason, but it's still a part of it. Without it, you're left with a social club."	"&gt;and every time it was black, jew, foreign language

533	"Yeaaa... no.  Before I really start, I will mention the intro below  the title, it is a bit on the factually correct and humorous side:

""Anglo-Saxon capitalism's drive to maximize profits in the short term won't save the planet.  Perhaps the Chinese model can?

But the answer to the question in it is no.

In the following quote we can see a false assertion:

 ""Decarbonisation of the economy requires alternatives for coal and cars  that run on diesel, and that plays to capitalism‚Äôs strengths.  Innovation is what capitalism is all about, and there has been  staggeringly rapid progress in developing clean alternatives to coal,  oil and gas.""

As the author already stated, maximizing the amount of trade widgets is what Capitalism is about.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"", an old saying many are probably familiar with.

 That would be more along the lines of why there has been rapid progress  in developing clean alternatives.  We find our survival to be a  necessity, so it is helping to motivate us to develop these other  technologies.

These technologies have been around for quite a  while now, such as hydroelectric and wind power and we could have been  developing them all along, but corruption and the drive for profits by a  greedy subgroup have held them back.

""Great advances are also  being made in battery technology, which is vital for the new generation  of electricity-powered vehicles.""

Sure, it may be ""important""  now, but what really held back development in the past?  Could it have  been the profit making technique of Planned Obsolescence?  Could be...

 ""And, more than anything, it means accepting that the world needs to  wage war against climate change. Powerful vested interests will say  there is plenty of time to act, and they are aided by climate-change  deniers who say there is nothing to worry about. These people need to be  called out. They are not deniers, they are climate-change appeasers.  And they are just as dangerously misguided as fascism‚Äôs appeasers in the  1930s.""

Here I can agree with the author to an extent.  He does  need to be called out as a Capitalism and Consumerism denier / appeaser."

It's just anti-communism is a fundamental aspect of the American civic religion, and as a result endless red-baiting and scaremongering has become an integral part of our particular politics. So, perhaps somewhat uniquely, America can have the bogeyman of revolution existing in spite of literally all aspects of reality showing that the American left is not only completely impotent but also constantly consumed with eating itself to a truly comical extent.

To clarify, I think an organized left is required in order for a fascist movement to even *arise*, not necessarily to sustain itself in power. There have been fascist movements that have come to power against an organized left that have soon degenerated into a more traditional reactionary authoritarianism - Franco's Spain comes to mind. And there have been fascist movements that arose against an organized left but never came to power - such as the Brazilian Integralists. But I don't think there's ever really been a fascism that arose without an organized left, simply because labor parties and a robust labor movement have always been a mainstay all over the world outside of the United States; I guess American exceptionalism strikes again."

The Aztecs ate spirulina, and the Japanese eat krill (okiami)."	"Ok so I think I got it figured out.  I've got two meters.  One's labeled ""PV Meter"" and the other is ""PV Billing Meter"".  So my ""PV Meter"" is showing how many kWh my panels are making.  The ""PV Billing Meter"" is showing two numbers.  There's a 2 digit number labeled ""Va"" and then a 5 digit number labeled kWh.  You'd think the Va would be how many watts the house is pulling at that given moment, but nope apparently it's showing what's referred to on my bill as ""registers"".

So when it's showing ""09"" Va, according to my bill that's ""CPS Energy Delivered"" (CPS is the electric service btw), and ""10"" is ""PV Surplus"".

The electric company just installed some ""smart meters"" this past week.  My previous issue was my ""PV Meter"" was showing less than what my inverter program was saying was generated.  Now it's matching up 1 to 1.

So all that being said, engineer to engineer let me ask you a question.  I've got a nice, large tree on the south side of my house that keeps some of the panels from getting direct sunlight.  I can see it on my inverter monitor where several panels will be outputting nearly 200watts, some will be doing maybe 100, and others are way down in the 50watt area.  Does it even make sense to trim back the tree to get direct sunlight on all my panels?

585	"&gt;What this person is saying is that when evaluated on closer to equal starting platforms (having a sample size of people who regularly exercise, instead of all people), females and males perform at relatively equal levels for reaction time and hand to eye coordination. As they explained, this differentiation must be made because as a society, women are not only less physically inclined towards sports (being usually physically inferior to men), but also are not pushed in that direction by mentors or offered any incentives to pursue that type of career.

That's not really a 'closer to equal' starting platform though because like I said you could be polling what would essentially amount to the 'upper half' of woman vs most of the men. That study, in particular, wasn't linked and I'd really be curious to see exactly what they were controlling for.

Also, I'm pretty sure it was only mentioned for reaction time, not hand-eye coordination.

Unfortunately, you're right that there doesn't seem to be a lot of data on these things, but I feel like the eye test can be can be pretty telling. Like, just curious is there any woman athlete that you've seen that you really think is as sharp as the best male player in their sport, mechanically? 

Not only that but now with the rise of eSports and video games there is a lot of an anecdotal evidence that seems to exist as these types of games rely heavily on reaction time, hand-eye, etc and are virtually completely male dominated. Pretty much exclusively male at the highest level barring very few women.

&gt;To me this is as ridiculous a stance as the garbage that that Google employee spouted a few months ago - that women's brains are not made as well for programming or other tech careers as men's are.

I'm just curious why that would be such a ridiculous stance? We know that men and women are different physiologically and psychologically. And we know there is no true separation of the body and the mind. We're all just organ and tissue so why would it be hard to believe that based on differences in the brain there would be varying aptitudes?

I actually don't see how there's any evidence at all for that not being true. It seems more to me that pretty much the lions share of the evidence points in that direction, but people continually like to reference small exceptions, which are perfectly explained by varience. 

I mean the Google case is just another example where men do excel in math and logic (like *actual* logic) compared to women, which are both large parts of programming. Not only do we have evidence that men excel in these areas at the level of the brain, but the data in majors like math and philosophy also back up these finding. The graduates are predominantly male, as well as those entering into the program. That's exactly what we'd expect to find.

Then there is also how IQ is distributed between males and females. Again, looking at that it's no surprise that you see more men in math and philosophy (which are among the majors that seem to demand the highest IQ, closely followed by engineering/comp sci)

The thing that I don't get though is why these claims are met with such hostility. What *nobody* is saying is that women, under no circumstances, should be allowed in these positions. I mean, if you have a doctorate in mathetics from MIT and you've done important research nobody is going to question your ability to do math. 

You're going to have an opportunity to prove yourself competent every step of the way. It seemed to me that his memo was more specifically addressing people who were hired by some type of arbitrary quota and turned out *not* to be competent.

I mean, there have been plenty of influential female scientists. There are less of them then their male counterparts, but it's not as if these people who are great and being actively blocked from sharing their greatness.

593	Well his authority is implicit. He is, after all, the Supreme being. This might be a hard pill to swallow but I have found that living my life according to God's principles is the best way to live. I wouldn't change for anything in the world. So he created us, it follows that he knows what's the best for us, and he wants what's best for us. Once we understand this and prove it to ourselves, obeying God becomes much much easier (1 John 5:3)	"You might be interested in studying Leibinz's theory of perception, or Ruyer's theories of consciousness.

I think there are at least three kinds of consciousness: there is the sort of consciousness that all living things have, like how cells signal or how plants know when to bloom in spring. This is the sort of consciousness that Ruyer likens to a worker focused on his work. We might say it is the consciousness of consumption, since it involves objects actually entering into the living subject. This subject's consciousness is focused entirely within the subject itself.

Then there is the sort of consciousness most evident to us: the one associated with the nervous system and the five senses. This consciousness is different from the first sort, since it doesn't involve consuming the object, nevertheless, the object is within the subject's consciousness. Furthermore, the object is known through the object's behavior within a sensory field (the eye knows an object in so far as it reflects a certain slither of light). The object is also know in relation to the subject (will it eat me? Can I eat it?).

I think the latter sort of consciousness is qualitatively distinct from the former, rather than a mere advancement of the former, because we experience each kind as distinct. We don't feel our cell's activities unless there are nerves involved. Even damage to our body is undetected if we don't see it and our nerves aren't there.

Anyway, finally we have reflective or recursive consciousness, where *consciousness itself* is an object of consciousness. This allows the subject to compare the mental with the object, detecting whether the image of the mind is true to the object. Reflective consciousness allows the subject to discern past the appearances of an object given to the senses to know the object in itself, which is the root of all of what we call science. This kind of consciousness then, as a result, doesn't necessarily have to relate the object to the subject, and so we might say the object can be loved for its own sake, which is the root of what we call art. Such a subject can even reflect on its actions and relate them to a standard, knowing if they are right or wrong. As far as we are aware, only human beings show any real evidence of this kind of consciousness."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

"As far as I can tell, he's just saying that when GTA V was released, the PS3 and Xbox 360 were both at their peak in terms of units sold, both being at about 80m. This meant a huge customer base of about 160m.

This is not the case for this console generation where, while the PS4 is at about 80m sold, the Xbox One is only at about 40m according to predictions, meaning, assuming one person to a console, about 40m fewer customers if GTA 6 came out now.

While you can criticise the fact that he's not taking into account that GTA 6 is probably coming out quite a few years from now, and that both consoles are still selling very well, your claims are also just wrong.

&gt;Even if that were true or even measurable in any truly accurate way it doesn't change anything.

&gt;And if you think it makes a difference now then it could be said with your comment that PS3 was lagging when GTA V was released.

I mean, it is true, it is measurable and the size of the customer base does change quite a lot. Also, the PS3 was not lagging behind at that point, both consoles reported 80m sales very close to GTA V's release date.

&gt;Maybe by the end of their lifespan they were close but we're talking about the $1 billion sales in 3 days for GTA V here and that was released 3 years before the end of the lifespan of both consoles.

&gt;The PS3 through much of its lifespan was lagging behind and only started significantly closing the gap in the last few years of the lifespan.

As I've said, they were both at 80m very close to when the game was released. Not sure what you mean when you say GTA V was released 3 years before the end of their life. It was released in September 2013 and both the PS4 and Xbox Once were released in November 2013 meaning GTA V was released 2 months before the end of the seventh generation.

What if your legal immigrant neighbor wants to bring his family to live in his privately owned house? What part of the NAP is violated then? It certainly isn't trespassing unless you think you have more right to your neighbor's home than he does.

You started out with ""illegal"" then ended up arguing with ""legal"". I never said that the entire US is MY property. I argue that a nation has territory. If you're arguing for abolishing all nation-state borders in the world, just say it.

The few basic functions of a government are to define and defend property rights, defend against foreign aggression, protect its citizens against each other, and adjudicate disputes, within its border. If it isn't allowed to assume a border, the necessary qualifier for all those functions would vanish.

Neither do I have a problem with it. But how would you achieve this ideal? It's easy to just state an ideal.

A great example of what was awesome in the UK was giving birth.

Our first kid was born at the JR Radcliffe hospital, and they organized us in to a ""new parents"" group about 5 months before the due date. It was a great experience and we met every 2 weeks for some education about what to expect, and where people could discuss their concerns.

The actual birth itself took a long time (like 19h, my poor wife) and we had two nurses with us all the time keeping us company. Everything we needed was taken care of.

Then after the birth there were 5 follow up visits to our home where they came to make sure everything was ok. Those were really nice, as my wife was exhausted and going to the hospital would have been a pain. The follow ups confirmed that everything was OK with her milk etc.

The other case that comes to mind is that my father and grandfather both had strokes in their early 50s. Hearing this, I got a full genetic screen done on myself to spot any plausible issues and got a really thorough report on their opinion of my possible issues. The proactiveness was impressive.

Total costs of all of this being 0 GBP was nice.

My guess is that there is strong evidence that the effects observed in this study are due to pheromones working directly on an evolved mechanism. However, the brain can *learn* to use that same evolved mechanism in response to an evolutionarily novel stimulus. In this case, the brain would learn to trigger the same ""warm-and-fuzzies"" response when it detected the cologne as the normal scent of the partner without cologne. If cologne did trigger the same response, my prediction would be that the response is [a] always less intense than the response to a smell that included pheromones, [b] that the effect would only be observed in women who were dating a man who wore *the same cologne all the time* (meaning it wouldn't be seen if the man didn't wear cologne very often or if the man changed his cologne often), and [c] that the woman only ever smelled her partner's cologne when it was coming from her partner (meaning that no other men the woman interacts with also wear that same cologne).

You should ask your doctor/dentist for a prescription for ""debacterol"". It is an acid swab that will destroy canker sores. It works really well if you get bad ones. (does **not** work on herpes)

Also, a bit weird that he tested it. A canker sore is on the soft tissue in your mouth. (Herpes is not) I am not a doctor, but even the worst canker sore(imagine a huge cluster of sores on the inside of your cheek) could never be the result of herpes. Herpes might cause a really bad blister on your lip which spread to your whole face, but it wouldn't move into your mouth(as far as I know)

A lot of doctors get mixed up, but the two are obviously different and the only similarity is that they cause oral sores.

I don't really have an agenda, but as a sufferer of canker sores, I wound up learning a lot about herpes/canker. I kept having doctors insist that canker sore=herpes. This apparently isn't abnormal. There was apparently a case where a picture of a canker sore was used in medical literature as an example of herpes.

But I honestly think it was just made to look cool for the trailer. It didn't further the plot of the film at all and felt really out of place. The actual fight itself was too short and too lame. Batman literally throws a kitchen sink at Superman. Their mothers having the same name was the reason they became best buddies instantly. WTF? They absolutely and pointlessly WASTED (as well as botched) Doomdsay by shoehorning him into the film because they needed something for the partially formed Justice League to fight at the end when it should have been about Batman fighting Superman. Wonder Woman was shoehorned in before she was introduced with her own film. The Flash and Aquaman cameos were stupid and pointless. Why did Lex have their logos on those files? Did he make the logos? What? They wasted the death of Superman because now we'll never see it the way it should be, huge processions through the streets with superheroes like Green Lantern attending. It should have been a moving plot point but it was just kinda 'Meh, he's dead' with a quiet little funeral with Batman and Wonder Woman off in the shadows.

"I'm going to graduate in about a week so here's my two cents:

You're paying to go to college, so why not just go to class? I understand that it's your money and you do want you want with it, but what is that money worth if you're not using it for what you paid for? Whether you're taking out loans or paying upfront, you're still paying money go to to school. Go to class, seriously. If not for the education, at least do it for the routine. Not every professional job is going to allow flexibility for your schedule. Of course, if you have a dire reason that you absolutely cannot go to class, sure, you can skip class, but at least notify your professor that you won't be in class and consult the syllabus for what you're going to miss on that date.

Internships are fantastic opportunities that introduce you to your field. Paid or unpaid, it's well-worth the experience and can provide some insight on your future career. My major requires an internship to graduate, but it's still a learning experience even if yours doesn't require one.

Your professors want you and every student to pass. If you're struggling, reach out to them. I made out with a GPA of around 3.00 because I rarely spoke with most of my professors, and I believe I could've done better, but it's already too late for me. Your professor would be delighted to help you out with your grade. Of course, not every professor is like this, so take this advice with a grain of salt. 

Your college experience is how you make it. Join fraternities, sororities, clubs, organizations, etc. You can work on campus to make money and friends, depending on the job. You can also help a professor with their research. Like the definition of success, you define your experience as how you want it to be."	AdviceAnimals	AdviceAnimals	-1

Instead, you decided as you went along and let anger get the better of you (I know how easy that is in the heat of the moment, but it's also the kind of thing manipulators live for because it means they get to play the victim because you were yelling and so mean!) 

Sit your husband down and come up with your plan. Make sure he is on the same page about his mother's interference (all the planning on the world won't mean diddly if he doesn't see a problem with what she's doing.) You may have to compromise a little and adjust your plan if he isn't (ie, if you don't want her anywhere near your daughter, you might have to settle for supervised visits. If you don't want her in your home, you might have to agree that she can come over when you are already scheduled to be out of the house, otherwise he can visit her at her house.) Once you've agreed on your plan, sit down with your mother in law and communicate it to her. I probably wouldn't include reasons why and stick to something like ""these are the rules if you want to be in our lives, you can agree and see us and your granddaughter, or disagree and not see any of us.""

I would definitely have any conversation in a place that you and hubby can easily and quickly leave if she gets any attitude (not your house - we know she won't leave.

I think your theory of D&amp;D culture is probably possible - perhaps even just on a sub-conscious level. Remember, by the time Garfield designed Magic, he had already designed dozens of games, even if they weren't published. One thing his friends from the time say, is that he really just understood games on an instinctive level - so I imagine the 20 life came from a sub-conscious place, perhaps inspired by years of playing D&amp;D. I know that's not a concrete answer, but I hope it helps!""*

"They're an explicitly socialist government, implementing explicitly pro worker laws, which was originally elected on the back of its socialist credentials. It's a country transitioning to socialism.

Regardless, socialism is when there is worker control over the means of production, as opposed to capital control over the means of production. Venezuela is 'socialist', because while it hasn't outright expropriated the entirety of the means of production, it has effectively neutered capital by introducing price controls, capital controls, threats of expropriations, and poor and arbitrary rule of law to make it so that capital no longer controls the means of production, whilst still technically owning it on paper. If you can't set the price for the goods you create, if you can't move your capital, and if you can't shut down your means of production due to threats that the government will expropriate it if you do (which is well documented in the Venezuelan case), there is no longer capital control over the means of production.

So yeah, maybe most of the means of production are, on paper, still owned by capital. But with the restrictions on them, they're no longer controlled by capital. They're held in trust by the vanguard party on behalf of the proletariat. It's not a society that has achieved full socialism, but it's definitely a socialist society."	australia	australia	-1

754	"They'd have to have worked on it to a much greater degree, much earlier, and stuck with it for that to happen.

Apple *did* release a game console, the [Pippin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin), in 1996. It failed, and in fact was officially shut down when Steve Jobs ended Macintosh clones in 1997.

It wasn't just a matter of making more competitive gaming hardware, though. I have firsthand experience with how shitty G3 and G4 Macs were for gaming, as I did have a Power Mac G4 for gaming around 2002-2006. They were expensive, underpowered, with an extremely limited selection of both graphics cards and compatible games. But that's not the real reason why Mac gaming is bad.

The main thing Apple needed to have done, if they wanted to keep gaming relevant on the Mac, would be to push harder for OpenGL to be the standard graphical API instead of DirectX, and to push for performance improvements to keep it viable for gaming and not just professional applications. In the early days of DirectX, there was still some competition between it, OpenGL, and 3dfx Glide, but DirectX won and being a Windows-only API, it meant that most games were Windows-only. ~~Plus, DirectX has always been focused on gaming, so it's faster than OpenGL.~~

Now Apple is even letting OpenGL stagnate. While they do officially support it, they only support an older version, and they're pushing for their own proprietary Metal API instead. No major games are going to support Metal, so Mac games just use OpenGL, which has poor performance now compared with DirectX.

It would have taken a lot of effort from Apple to make the Mac a viable gaming platform. Hell they could have probably licensed DirectX from Microsoft, but that's obviously nothing that Jobs would have considered. Now that Macs can boot into Windows, there's no real reason to try to make Mac gaming good - if you want to play games, just reboot into Windows and play there."

755	"Hi there, great question! I think it is important that we have these discussions about how we can ensure that admission to medical school is an equitable process for those from all social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I am the first person from my family to attend University and growing up no one in my social circle was in medicine. Regardless, I still feel incredibly privileged to have been admitted to medical school and have had the opportunity to pursue the activities that helped me gain admission. Although I would say that from my experience, family income is not an insurmountable barrier to these opportunities! My family is incredibly supportive of the work I do but I personally wanted to self-fund my education. In Canada (and at UBC), I think this is entirely possible due to tuition becoming quite subsidized (compared to medical schools in other countries), student loans are very accessible, and most of the research I've done has been funded by the University or external research awards. UBC Medicine recently posted about their MCAT assistance program that will help lower the costs for students with financial hardship (http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2017/11/01/mcat-fee-assistance-program-for-canadians/)

Regarding your comment about residency placement - I would say from my knowledge, financial or family resources become even less of a consideration at this point. Life experience is not just about traveling the world and I would say facing hardship (whatever it is) gives you plenty of life experience :) Also, your amicability is entirely dependent on you and not what privilege you may have!

I'm not saying this is a perfect system, and undoubtedly it is unfortunate that some groups have a tougher time getting into medical school and succeeding in medicine. However, I do think the system makes an effort to level the playing field and it is entirely possible to build an awesome CV (and career) regardless of your background!

774	"For the following points feel free to replace 'Messenger' with any IM app of your choice (Whatsapp, Telegram, Viber, Line, Skype, WeChat, iMessage, etc.)

1. Messenger is free, just requires wifi/data connection. A lot of carriers in the US offer free SMS (or at least some free SMS), but that is not the case everywhere. Besides, generally if you're on an unlimited SMS package, you are paying more for that feature.

2. Messenger can send messages internationally instantly, for free. Even those on free SMS packages will probably have to pay to send messages to people in another country, unless they have an international SMS package, which costs more.

3. Messenger is not limited in terms of message length.

4. Messenger can have inline images, videos, emoji, etc. SMS/MMS often has issues dealing with these kinds of things.

5. Group messaging, which is a huge feature that SMS does not have natively. There are solutions but they're not reliable and it usually depends on everyone owning the same phone.

6. Messenger does not require that you have the recipient's phone number, something that is becoming more and more archaic nowadays. You don't always want to give our your phone number to someone you want to talk to, anyway.

7. Messenger and most other IM clients have read receipts, so you can tell when your message has been delivered, when they have seen it, and when they are typing their response.

8. Messenger and most other IM clients also have the option of voice messages, which might seem stupid at first but once you start using them to communicate regularly you realise just how much more efficient they are.

9. Messenger and other IM clients are multiplatform, i.e. I can have Whatsapp on my phone, on my tablet, and the desktop client running on my PC. They're all synchronised and I can communicate no matter which device I'm using. SMS is restricted to your phone. Though there are solutions that allow you to route messages through your PC, you still need your phone.

10. IM clients are often encrypted. SMS is not.

11. Messenger and other IM clients usually have other social features built-in, for example being able to send someone a contact card with somebody's contact info, or instantly sending someone your location, or file attachment. Anyone who has ever lived in China will attest to the ridiculous number of extra features WeChat has, some more useful than others (including an electronic payment wallet that is accepted almost every store and restaurant and can be used to send money between friends, ordering and paying for services from taxis to dog grooming straight through the app, buying train/plane tickets directly through the app, managing investment portfolios, etc.)

There's 11 reasons off the top of my head, I could easily think of more but for me, those are all viable reasons to use an IM client over SMS.

The tl;dr of it all is that SMS is outdated tech that still has its uses. But why bother using a vastly inferior communications protocol rather than a specifically designed solution that addresses all of the weaknesses of SMS? Maybe if you're a luddite who wants to resist change for the sake of it, sure."	"The problem with socialism and capitalism is that they work.... if done right.

This is a false narrative promulgated by theists. You can find authors from the third and fourth centuries arguing for a literal Genesis and Flood. It's an a theist urban legend that there was not a recent retreat away from science.

See, I can call you a liar and not substantiate my claim too.  Does it add to the discussion though? 

Seriously though, you think that if you were able to point to a few outliers (which, for the record, you did not do) that means that it would be warranted to dismiss very valid concerns with the majority of people that practice religion today?

I'm not saying that there aren't people that have reconciled faith and science, but it takes some work.  Science is a set of tools to determine what reality is: from reason to belief, regardless of what we want it to be.  Religion is, by definition, belief without reason."

What exactly are you doing here again?

&gt;You have no figures and are making an incredibly bad analysis from the start by ignoring the cost of marketing (if you're gonna use the full sales profit, you have to count marketing despite the reason you used being ""it's their choice"" which is asinine in and of itself in there because those sales would be far lower without it, that's just ridiculous to do) and assuming a $60 game sells for a $60 profit. Even if it comes directly through the publishing company they will never get the full price, from the discussion I've seen it goes between 90% being a best case and generally the profit is more around 50%-60% of the base cost.

No one has figures because they won't share them. Yet claim we're wrong and definitely don't provide the data to prove it. If they have the data to prove their claims, why don't they provide it?

And lets not forget digital sales accounting for a shitton of almost pure profits. They only make about 60% of the money from games sold at retailers. About 90% from digital as you mentioned. And don't forget I left out a whole million sales.

&gt;I've said it already, but this is stupid. I won't even entertain that notion. Marketing is critical to reaching, ya know, the market. That thing that you say lets them easily make profit. The fallacious thing is using titles like Pubg and Hellblade to say ""see you don't need marketing"" when they are the exception and not the rule. I mean honestly, that is incredibly asinine. I'm actually annoyed that you're actually even arguing this, you should never use this line of reasoning in the context of this argument, and certainly not when you use extremely generous estimates off of sales figures which were significantly aided through marketing efforts. I mean for fuck's sake.

How they decide to market the game is entirely up to them. If they are a competent company, they are spending exactly as much marketing as they feel is profitable for them. If they can't handle their own resources, they deserve to fucking go out of business. Its a non point.

&gt;It's risk aversion, stop using moralistic terms and judgments, that's a different discussion. You cannot chalk up to greed when every company that's successful avoids risks, they still funded a third title despite underperforming and that one didn't do nearly as well as the second.

Except its really not. You can't justify extreme things like this as just plain risk aversion. The industry functioned just fine with far less profits, its idiotic to think that suddenly it changed.

&gt; Minecraft especially merchandizes massively

Merchanidizing is entirely different than MTX. And if you think it needs those to be profitable... lol

And Fortnite is a F2P game. 

Please tell me about struggling indie devs that need MTX, tell me specifically which ones. The games I mentioned aren't exactly struggling games trying to make it by.

And you literally can't justify ""oh we're making over twice as much as we put in"" as a failure, no matter how much of a spin you try to put on it. End of the day, there are record profits for games, excellent margins, before MTX even enter the equation.

They do *not* need MTX to pad their lines, they just want them.

Only through your own mindset are you adding the layers of emotion onto it. If you're struggling to see the world in a positive light, at least do your best to stop feeding your life negative energy, and reach a neutral state, the truest, least altered state you can be in.

This may seem easier said than done, but think about it. You know of the beauty behind your life, you said it yourself, the trip was initially a positive  experience - but through mentally seperating yourself from your friends, you alienate your own conciousness. 

**Imagine life as a sheet of paper, bearing an image of  everything that happens to you. It's a seemingly infinite sheet of paper with every aspect of your life, good or bad, portrayed.**

You can either grab a pair of scissors and begin to cut at the form, breaking it down into smaller and smaller forms, letting the aspects of your life drift away from one another as if they're not all deeply related, until you are truly broken..

...or you can fold the paper. Tuck away thoughts that don't help  you portray how you would like to live, and put things in focus that are beautiful. With enough time and energy deciding what thoughts and mindset will bring you further in life, you'll end up with a magnificent piece of Oragami you can present to yourself and the world as your existance.

Bjergsen in EU did not manage to carry his team. He was regarded as a potential new talent and had some great games but he also had many flaws.

He was also required to keep a certain distance away from children and areas where children might be.

Every couple weeks he would be subject to polygraph tests asking him if he had any interactions with minors if he said yes he risked violating the terms of his plea, if he was caught lying he risked the same. They would take some considerations of the normal interactions like ‚Äúyes, I saw minors at a store I was at, but avoided interacting with them‚Äù but Halloween was a particular difficult time for him to do anything.

"To expand a little on what /u/angelcake said, the testes are the primary producer of testosterone in AMAB people. Having them removed gets rid of the body's primary source of testosterone, therefore eliminating (usually) the need for an anti-androgen. Anti-androgens can be a bit hard on the liver over an extended period of time, so it's better if one can stop taking them at some point. Either an orchi or GRS (which also includes an orchi in the process) will take care of that.

Some trans women do not want, or cannot get, GRS, and orchi is a much less expensive (and far quicker and less invasive) option. It's often a stopgap, and a person can still have GRS in the future if they choose, but it at least eliminates certain worries. If for some reason a trans woman was unable to get hormones for a while, having had an orchi means they wouldn't have to worry about remasculinizing anymore (although it's important to note that *everyone* needs a primary sex hormone, whether estrogen or testosterone. Going for more than a year or two without a primary sex hormone of any type massively increases the risk of osteoporosis, among other nasty health issues.

What Happened to 'Blade'?](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/blade-started-a-revolution-was-abandoned-by-marvel-1135703)

In a nutshell, Blade came in the same era as Howard the Duck (1986) and Straight-to-video releases The Punisher (1989), Captain America (1990) and then there was the matter of the unreleased The Fantastic Four (1994). It gave Marvel some juice but it wasn't ""MCU"" really.

Don't get me wrong, I *definitely* think the whole Black Panther is black empowerment focus from Marvel Disney was (genius) marketing and opportunistic capitalism, as much as I feel the results of that movies portrayal of black people as intelligent and heroes of their own story had a real impact on change and DEFINITELY altered the zeitgeist on ""black"" movies, turning them into ""just movies"". But I don't think suppressing Blade was in any way some scheme to change the face of black firsts from Marvel or anything.

I mean Blade was the first somewhat hit from an (at the time) struggling comic book company who had a string of garbage and flops in cinema in a time when super hero movies wasn't a genre itself but a subset of action and/or comedy."

If you don't want to read it, the TLDR is that this poll is total statistical garbage and you can't draw any meaningful conclusions from it.  
  
&gt;I'd be happy if this was true, but this poll is completely invalid statistically. As far as I can tell, it's not random at all and you have to choose to seek it out and participate, which makes it no more useful than a Facebook poll. All it takes is a bunch of people from one side telling all their friends to go vote and you end up with an incredibly unrealistic result like a very conservative, very rural state apparently being 80% in favour of legalization. Like, seriously, you think over 70% of Republicans in North Dakota want pot legalized? Give me a break. This poll is a joke and the fact it's sitting at 95% upvoted says a lot about the willingness of people in this sub to read past a headline.

&gt;Edit: Jesus Christ people. I just read that there were only 237 people in North Dakota that participated in this poll. Even if it was a randomly-selected poll (which, again, it's not), 237 isn't even close to a large enough sample to get valid results. Anything below about 300 and you might as well be making up the responses due to the incredibly high margin of error. That's why you'll almost never see publicly released political polling with less than that number of respondents. I can't overstate this enough: don't base any of your opinions on this crap.

You need to use the proper screen, primarily an IPS screen with at minimum 100% sRGB color gamut coverage. The screen should be calibrated to show accurate colors. You need a printer that covers at minimum 100%sRGB gamut as well, do not print in CYMK mode. 

Make sure to export your edited photo to the correct color gamut you will be printing on. If your screen is 100% adobeRGB, and your printer is set to adobeRGB, then be sure to export to adobeRGB. Otherwise, if your printer only does sRGB, then export to sRGB. 

Lastly, web browsers only display in sRGB color gamut, so don‚Äôt export in adobeRGB to host on your website or instagram. 

Doing this will equal prints that are correct the first time printed. Also prevents getting prints too dark or too bright. "	"As a learning camera, the Olympus is pretty great then! I did enjoy the kit lens it came with, but I also did replace it as soon as my budget allowed.

I would recommend [Nox](https://www.gog.com/game/nox) as an ARPG. It's a very good game for being released in 2000. There is replay value in the form of each class. You can get it on GOG. I'm actually impressed that you've hit some other games without playing Nox first.

Darkstone and Fate were kind of cookie cutter.

Transistor and Terraria are not really ARPGs, but are highly recommended.

[Transistor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237930/Transistor/) is a tactical RPG (ie, Final Fantasy Tactics). There is replay value in the form of a NewGame+ mechanic.

[Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/), of course, is a sandbox crafting game. If you are playing it as an ARPG, you're missing 95% of the value.

[Magicka](https://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/Magicka/) is not on your list, but as an isometric action game, would probably fit.

But something strange happened because afterwards I bitterly complained about how cold it was... And God touched the chair and it became warm. It became so warm that later the guy next to me complained and wondered why the seat was so hot.

I am a rational and intelligent person. And Christians get a bad wrap because they believe certain things without question.

963	"Lack of sleep results in a decline in your cognitive abilities, and grows more severe the longer you go without adequate sleep. 

There are two ways in which this can occur: acute total sleep deprivation or chronic partial sleep restriction. The former means prolonged wakefulness for a large amount of time, with little or no moments of sleep. The latter is much more common in our society, and is when you are getting less than a proper night's sleep for several days in a row. 

Total sleep deprivation first leads to mild cognitive impairment: decline in spacial awareness, difficulty focusing, and working memory. As the impacts of total sleep deprivation compound, decision-making and even long-term memory experience adverse changes. 

Partial sleep deprivation, particularly in regards to partial sleep restriction, impacts your attention, spacial awareness, and emotion regulation. Chronic partial sleep restriction can be slightly alleviated by getting more rest (or ""catching up on sleep"") but will be just as bad once you go back to restricted sleep schedules that are less than adequate. So sleeping in on Saturday and Sunday may feel great, but you'll be depriving yourself of sleep right when you get back to your weekly sleep schedule (or lack thereof).

966	as another poster said, you can split the family account 6 ways. There are some groups you can join on reddit where people ask for others to join their family plan. I think they usually ask for a year's payment in advance so they don't have to hound you every month for $3. 	"Saw there were tons of responses for getting through the month but had a couple ideas that might help in the slightly longer term. 

First: Check out Dollar Tree and check out some of their frozen foods. Dollar Tree does take TANF according to the signs they post at the ones I've seen. They have a variety of frozen veggies, some of which you can get at Walmart for similar prices, but their frozen fruit is a lot cheaper than you can get elsewhere. Their canned goods are not always cheaper, so write down prices from other stores and compare. Dollar Tree has the cheapest peanut butter, bagels and bread I know of. Google to find information about starting a ""price book"" to keep track of grocery sales. Depending what you are looking for, there are some things cheaper at Wegmans. 

Second: Start a garden to add nutrition to the basic rice/beans/eggs. Veggies are a better choice to add nutrition than trying to step up to buy meat instead of just beans/eggs. You can do this (on a smaller scale) even in most apartments. I grew a garden pretty successfully on a Virginia second floor balcony. One of the other posts sounded like you were in Maryland. When I was in Northern Virginia, early Feb would be a good time to start seeds indoors. Dollar Tree also has seed packets for $.25, and now would be the time to buy. I think Walmart's cheapest seeds start at $.99. I *think* some states do allow you to buy seeds with TANF money. Try spinach and lettuce right now to put outside once they sprouted, and tomatoes to start seeds inside to put outside in a couple months. But tomatoes need big containers with a lot of soil (5 gallon buckets at minimum), and soil can get expensive. But if you have a house with a garden, then tomatoes are easier to do. Sugar snap peas are another good choice for this time of year, but I haven't seen seeds for those in Dollar Tree. Use any plastic storage container you have (that has never held chemicals) to plant in, and poke holes in the bottom with a nail or kitchen knife. Start seeds in egg cartons.  Wash some milk jugs out well and cut off the top half. Nowadays, people start seeds out of store-bought sterile seed starter soil, but my mom used to take regular garden soil and put it in a baking pan in the oven for a while. She said it stunk up the house though. You may also want to post to gardenweb.com in the mid-atlantic gardening forum and see if anyone has extra seeds or would start a couple extra veggie seedlings for you. Serious gardeners often start far more seeds than they need, then keep the best for themselves and give the others away. 

Third: Asian and Hispanic grocery stores. If you are within 45 miles of DC (where most of Maryland's population is) then there are probably some Asian and Hispanic groceries near you. Asian groceries usually have cheaper vegetables than your typical American grocery store and many things are cheaper than Walmart/Aldi. Hispanic groceries are worth checking out if you are doing price comparisons on large bags of beans/rice, and their spices (in bags) are often cheaper, if you can't find what you are looking for at Aldi's/Dollar Tree/the bottom row in Walmart's spices.

Fourth: Budget recipe ideas.  Buy a big thing of sweet potatoes, cut into large french fries, and bake in oven. Dust with cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice if you feel like getting fancy. Should please your son as something that usually would be more of a treat. Pancakes (with cheap flour and eggs) with frozen/canned fruit would be another idea. If you do have chicken thighs occasionally, save the leftover thigh bones, put them in a baggie in the freezer and make chicken stock from them when you've got a dozen or so. You can turn chicken stock and beaten eggs into egg drop soup as another cheap meal. Hot dogs can be cheap. One of my favorites as a kid was Rancher's skillet. Hot dogs chopped into bite sized pieces, along with tomato sauce and beans. Mom usually put green beans but kidney beans were more to my liking. Cabbage is usually your cheapest winter vegetable. Try a cabbage stir-fry or cabbage soup (usually with tomato sauce). It's too low calorie to be a meal if you weren't dieting, but it would be a filling side dish. Oatmeal. I used to buy big things of oatmeal, mix with applesauce or peanut butter, sometimes cinnamon or raisins then bake for a healthy snack bar. 

Fifth: Processed and pre-made snack foods aren't that frugal. While cornflakes and breakfast cereal may seem cheaper than some other foods, oatmeal and eggs are some of the cheapest foods you can get. Any pre-made, pre-proportioned snack foods for lunches probably are relatively expensive. Try PB&amp;J  sandwiches with cookie cutters, or huge bags of pretzels and put into baggies. Raisins would be a lot healthier than Gushers. "	Frugal	Frugal	-1

976	"&gt; why a multi-million dollar company paying slave wages 

explain to me what logic you used to arrive at ""Crunchyroll is paying slave wages to animators"" , they  have absolutely no influence on how animators or studios are being paid. Even when they're on production committee, it doesn't mean they have equal influence to everyone there or that they invested equal amount. Streaming services are on production committee to avoid bidding against other licensors for anime and possibly get exclusive rights, there are likely no other perks. 

It's extremely unlikely they can do anything else. You really think Japanese will let western companies just jump in and change how things work? They simply wouldn't allow CR on production committee if they had a problem with status quo."	"As someone who rated Your Lie in April as a 10 and it is currently my favourite anime I've ever seen, I do admit it has it flaws. Side characters left to dry and flashbacks like you mentioned, but also the use of Kaori hitting Kousei as well after what he went through in his childhood could be seen as very wrong.

Personally however, I was attracted from the first episode. Kousei as a character intrigued me, possibly due to me being in a bit of a dark place at the time, but to see someone who struggled to do the things he loved because of the guilt and pain really resonated with me and it still does whenever I rewatch it.

Additionally, I loved Kaori, Tsubaki and Watari. I believe that while they could have developed more, their magic was in how they helped develop Kousei and progress his character along. He starts the anime as a kid who's too afraid to play the piano after everything that happened in his life, but at the end he plays the piano and FOR Kaori. He bonds with Tsubaki over their childhood and how she's always been a constant in his life. He bonds with Watari as he realises that his girlfriend actually likes Kousei more than him, and instead of feeling bitter about it he nudges them together towards the end of the anime.

The music is a no brainer. The compositions made for the anime are beautiful, and 'Again' is still in my playlist because I love that song. 

The artstyle can be quite striking at times, admittedly, however when the animators get it right in some of the scenes and blend it together well it looks beautiful.

I love this anime, and I've not found anything that affected me as emotionally in the 2 years I've been watching anime, but I know why it wouldn't cater to other people. Not every anime is for everyone and thats the beauty of the medium. "	anime	anime	-1

"Difficult to say, was it the *Goddess* that answered your prayer or was it the *act* of prayer that triggered neurological connections in your brain and helped you solve the problem autonomously? There doesn't seem to be evidence to suggest the former, but there is some evidence to suggest the latter. 

The brain is still very much undiscovered by humans, we are very far from fully understanding it. However, there are studies about the effects of prayer/meditation on brain activity and how it may be linked to improving attention and focus. For example, one area of the brain that sees activity during prayer is the Posterior Cingulate Cortex 

""Probably the dominant current theory of PCC function is that it is directly involved in some aspect of internally directed thought ([Binder *et al.*, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B7); [Buckner *et al.*, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B16)). One early hypothesis was that the PCC plays a role in supporting the semantic elements of ‚Äòstimulus-independent‚Äô thought ([Binder *et al.*, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B7)). Activity in the PCC was higher when subjects report more ‚Äòstimulus-independent‚Äô thoughts, a state where mental activity is unconstrained by external stimuli. [Binder *et al.* (1999)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B7) proposed that the PCC, along with other DMN regions such as lateral inferior parietal regions, are continually involved in the conceptual processing associated with this type of freewheeling mental activity. In this state semantic knowledge is retrieved, maintained in awareness and manipulated for the purposes of problem solving and planning.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/)

Therefore prayer helps relieve stress, and allows the brain to reset. Maybe that helped you approach the mathematical problem with a new light? I'm not sure but at least it's one reasonable possibility grounded in reality.

Furthermore, it's not just prayer among religious people that have produced results, the same patter of brain activity has been seen in atheist and non-religious people who meditate. I'm not a brain surgeon or anything, just an avid reader. A few google searches on the subject of brain activity during prayer/meditation will bring up some interesting articles and studies. 

I'm not trying to strip away your conviction, after all it has also been argued that the intensity of brain activity depended on the strength of ones faith. I just think it's important that we look at causality, i.e. *perceived result* of prayer vs. *act* of prayer. That being said, if prayer resonates with you and helps you achieve what you want in life, then I say go for it, but just be careful when preaching to others about absolute truths when there is still so much to learn."

You might have heard on the news about a recent case where the DWP didn't like an Upper Tribunal ruling on people with mental health problems who couldn't travel, so they rewrote their own rules. The High Court ruled against this, and so the DWP now has to go back through all its records to find out who had been unfairly debited benefits.

Thinking strategically, the more important thing is the attention these cases get. It's one thing for a campaigner with a placard to call government policy ""blatantly discriminatory"" or to attack the credibility of the government's pet policy experts. But when the High Court says the same, and the government meekly accepts the ruling and does a full 180¬∞ policy reversal, that's a front-page headline!

There's another case going through the courts right now. It involves a guy called TP with a life limiting condition who moved to London to be near a treatment centre. This move was considered a change of circumstances, triggering a reassessment for benefits under the new, much meaner Universal Credit system, and he lost ¬£170+ a week as a result.

If he wins this case it will, again, help to highlight a much larger issue that has been largely ignored. If someone living next door to TP developed the same condition, he would also be assessed under the new system and be paid at the much lower rate. This is all part of the government's policy to ""incentivise work"" (i.e. don't let the NEETs get cozy).

"I believe what /u/succulent_headcrab meant was that it's weird the study felt it necessary to mention they contacted police, it should be a given and isn't relevant to the study in any way

As for the study itself the mentioning of the deaths as a side note feels dubious (as we understand).

The count of 36 patients isn't exactly a representative sample size for anything, especially since only 7 ingested just cannabis while 29 also had ""other ingredients"" which could mean anything without sifting through their sources.

That graph is laughable in how little it actually tells and the information explaining it doesn't help either ""The evolution is favorable in most cases (92%).only one nursling was admitted to intensive care for altered case of consciousness with respiratory distress. two deaths were noted""  
They don't explain what ""good"" ""intensive care"" and ""death"" means, presumably the ""good"" patients didn't need to come to the hospital at all and the 3 others obviously did but without any further explanation of the patients the deaths and intensive care could as much be caused by existing problems being exacerbated by the cannabis high as it is just the cannabis itself. For example if a child dies from an asthma attack brought on by peanut allergy it isn't fair to peanuts to claim they are fatal in children.

Also going through the references I'm not sure what the references were used for given that the this is a descriptive study from a certain hospital during a certain period while the references are all from different time periods and locations.

"Both languages have classes as first class citizens but in their own ways.

The approach taken by Dart, Java and most statically typed languages makes classes first class citizens in the sense that they participate at compile time in the elaboration of the type system. This means that the type system is static, it's an intrinsic property of the program.

In JavaScript or Python on the other hand, the type system is dynamic. It depends on the execution of the program and gets ""populated"" at runtime. In this regard, classes are not a first-class citizen. What makes classes a first class citizen in these languages is the fact that they are first-class values. Classes can be mutated, assigned to variables, stored into data structures, fall out of scope, created in loops etc. This makes them first class citizen but in a very different way.

Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. The static one allows the compiler to guarantee that every variable or argument will always have the correct type since it's impossible to compile the program if the type system is incoherent. Using a dynamic approach opens a lot of opportunities for metaprogramming, allowing you to shape the type system as your program executes."	programming	programming	-1

1070	I am beginning to think that they will pull a walmart in this scenario. They simply cannot stop their operations on a whim. Walmart had a situation with meat packers and trying to start a union. They eliminated the meat packer jobs entirely in the stores and sent them to distribution centers. Employees at a walmart store tried to start a union, so walmart closed the entire store for six months so they couldn't really strike. The teamsters are about to find out what happens when you screw with the big dog investors. UPS could hire a company as contractors for delivering the packages. They wear the uniforms but don't actually work for UPS. USPS does this with overseas jobs on military bases to save money. So by saying all that, I think this union is barking up a wrong tree. It will cause a massive shift towards contracting out the delivery job rather than increasing employee pay.

1086	"&gt; Right. They became the majority, were elected, and instated new laws legally.

Well, they dissolved the Weimar Republic.  They abolished the government and its constitution and created a new one.  It was ""legal"" in the sense that the government that enforced the old laws no longer existed.  

&gt; For instance, Trump was elected democratically, and has since made executive orders and signed off on things from Senate. He has put in judges that represented this new populist wave. This is legal for him to do.  If the new laws trump instates represent the current interest of the people, but contradicts the older interest of the people, he is still allowed to do that. He can change or have some laws changed, maybe even regarding how much power he has. 

Yeah... he can use powers delegated to him by the Constitution.  He can ""instate"" laws that have been passed by Congress, which is also elected by the people.  He cannot abolish the law.  


&gt; The point is that Nazis used the laws to hurt others.

They got rid of the laws that protected people they didn't like, because they considered them unjust.  I'm not sure why this makes laws less important than ""justice"".  We can have differing notions of justice, but laws in a liberal democracy are meant to protect individual rights, political stability, and the welfare of the public.

1088	I edited the original comment to go into some of them. As for higher returns with same variance, it's a consequence of linear algebra that any mean-variance efficient portfolio (a portfolio which gets the best possible mean return in the market for a given amount of variance/risk) will make the capital asset pricing model work. For instance, if the S&amp;P 500 index was mean-variance efficient, then the normal CAPM would work as an asset pricing model. It does not, which means the S&amp;P 500 index is not mean-variance efficient. It's possible to use a mix of market beta (the market beta of an asset measures how sensitive it is to movements in the overall stock market) investing and value investing to get a better combination of mean and variance than it's possible by using the market beta alone.

I would prefer actual real debate about things we could do. I‚Äôm sure there is a lot of variables other than banning any guns yet so many people just flat out refuse any possible debate. Our system was designed to find a middle road between extreme sides and that requires debate. 

IMO, memes like this are designed to just kill debate by refusing to see the loads of grey between the white and black sides. It uses an emotional jab to undercut debate. Sure, a large aspect of the 2nd is about personal gun ownership, but part of the 2nd is about giving regular citizens the fighting chance to rise up against a government they view as out of control. 

I firmly believe both aspects of the 2nd should be upheld. But I also feel that something could likely be done to help reduce danger at schools (and other places). Positions that try to just shut down debate is flat out wrong and a danger to our liberty. If someone feels that just discussing options is a bad move then I feel as if that position is even worse than actually banning a type of gun. Without real debate, liberty is just as dead as if they actually took all the guns.

You need to look out for your own mental health and wellbeing first. This is the hardest lesson for caregivers like you and me to learn: If you're not caring for yourself, you're no good to whomever you're caring for. In this case, your dad.

To put a finer point on it, if you're not watching what you eat, how much you sleep; if you're not managing your stresses, your own emotions, when it comes time to physically and emotionally be there for dad, you're not going to have the time, energy, or the mental fortitude to push him when he needs you most.

1132	But how are you supposed to decide on what you passion will be if you don't already have a passion for it?	"Light has energy and momentum. It doesn't have mass. The concept of relativistic mass, which was pointed out in other comments here, is outdated and it's better to just ignore/avoid it.  


You don't need mass to have momentum. There is no reason for that other than ""that's the equation we know from newtonian mechanics"". In relativity, particles without mass have momentum p=E/c  


You can calculate the momentum of light from Maxwells equations and it's nothing new. People have known that light carries momentum since forever (actually since maxwell) and we use that fact to predict a lot of stuff. I haven't read the article but I'm sure it's more than just ""we saw light has momentum"" because that has been known for decades or even centuries.  


To expand a little bit, momentum is a conserved quantity in translational invariant systems. In particular cases, which correspond to everyday massive non-relativistic particles, you get that it's p=mv, in other cases it's not. The actual definition of momentum is based on other concepts in physics (the Lagrangian)."	science	science	-1

"How very interesting! *Archaeopteryx* and *Deinonychus* are both members of the dinosaur group named ""Paraves"" or ""near-birds"". Within that group, *Deinonychus* falls within the dromaeosaurs (also called ""raptors""), whereas *Archaeopteryx* is part of the other group, the ""Avialiae"".

Your professor's example is indeed very relevant, since it was exactly that line of reasoning that brought Prof. Ostrom in the 1970's to conclusion that a century-long old theory which had received little attention but is accepted today, namely that birds are dinosaurs, may actually be true!

If you look at the wrist of *Deinonychus*, you will find that the hand connects to the arm with a half-moon-shaped bone, which is also called exactly that (semi-lunate carpal). This bone allowed *Deinonychus* to sweep its hand to the side, which we ourselves cannot do. *Archaeopteryx* also had this bone, and in modern birds it is preserved as a similarly-shaped portion of a fused bone: the carpometacarpus. Exactly this anatomical aspect allows birds to fold their wings along their sides and over their back. Because it is present in both the raptors and the Avialiae, we suspect it was also present in the shared ancestor of those groups.

&gt;Edit: I would also like to know what museums or institutions you've researched at to study *Archaeopteryx*

My PhD project is officially accommodated within Palack√Ω University in Olomouc (Czech Republic) but I have probably spend a little bit more time at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility because they have the best arrangements for studying these large data sets.

1141	"Obviously there is a discrepancy between the depth of mechanics of Melee-pedigree Smash games - including Project M, Rivals of Aether and more recently Icons - and Brawl-pedigree games like Smash 4. That topic has been done to death so I'll try not to draw too many comparisons, except to say that removing mechanics is pretty much by definition going to make your game feel slower, clunkier and overall less interesting. Smash 4 does add some of its own (likely unintentionally in most cases) but these don't make up for the removal of so many others. Even Brawl-exclusive techs like DACUS got the chopping block.

You likely already know this, but in the interest of clarity:

1v1 Smash matches can broadly be divided into 3 distinct ""phases"" - Neutral, combo/punish, and edgeguarding. Neutral is the state when both players are on relatively even footing and are trying to initiate engagements, get in some stray hits or maintain stage control. Combo game is when one player has gained an advantage and is using that advantage to tack on a lot of percent, put the opponent in an edgeguarding situation and kill them. Edgeguarding is when one opponent has knocked the other off the field and is trying to secure a kill by interfering with his ability to get back. 

In Smash 4, punishes are either repetitive or frustratingly short. The hitstun after landing a move is very short, meaning an opponent makes a mistake, you get a few little hits in, they escape and then you're right back to neutral again. If a character can combo at all, it's often either very flowcharty (Bayonetta) or completely linear, spamming the same set of moves until the opponent is high enough to use a finisher (ie. upair, upair, upair, upb)

This wouldn't be so bad if the edgeguarding was good, but it's even more watered down than combos are. Nearly every character has a very good recovery, and every character is able to snap to the ledge from massive distances, the so-called ""magnet hands."" Couple this with the fact that ledgehogging is replaced by ledge trumping, and as a result edgeguarding is nearly absent. Part of what makes Smash so engaging is the thrill of offstage play, that intense high risk high reward combat. But Smash 4, unless you get a hard read it's very difficult to secure a kill offstage. 

So without a solid punish game, and without a solid edgeguarding game, what are you left with? Look at a high level match, like [APEX 2017 grand finals](https://youtu.be/obWXT0WFdK8?t=2309). It's all neutral. These are the best players in the world, and 95% of the time it's two people hopping around, throwing out moves and hoping to get stray hits in. 2-3 moves and the punish is over nearly every time. They don't even *try* to edgeguard. Bayonetta, being one of the only characters with a powerful combo game, is far and away the best member of the cast. But it's not healthy here. She kills him off the top off a stray hit at 25%. 

Add to this the power of defensive options like shielding and the generally slow ground and air speed of the cast, and Smash 4 matches end up playing out more like slapfights than proper brawls. All neutral all the time isn't just boring to watch, it's boring to play. Combos make me feel like I got a kill because I earned it, not because I threw out a move at the correct time and caught somebody off guard.

I can't not mention it: Having to commit fully to a dash hurts. A lot. This isn't exclusive to Smash games either; games that let you quickly turn around just feel better and more responsive than those that don't. Smash 4 players have tried desperately to develop techniques to circumvent this as best they can, but there's only so much you can do. 

Every character feels floaty as hell. I love floaties but even I don't want to play them exclusively. 

[The game has 6 frames of input delay on all controllers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nT2VOLwrqk) 

Rage actively punishes players who are already struggling to secure a kill in a game where securing kills is inherently more difficult. 

Even the hit sound effects are honestly weak, with nearly all of them drawing on the same bizarre bassy crunching sound. 

---

You specified Smash 4, but I still want to mention Brawl just for the sheer egregiousness of decisions made that impact gamefeel. Everybody knows about tripping, but less people are aware of the fact that Brawl had a random 1-3 frames of extra input delay *intentionally built in* to the game. That and airdodging out of hitstun, because god forbid anyone get any combos at all. 

---

There are plenty of valid reasons to prefer the Brawl/Smash4 lineage of Smash mechanics. But Sakurai is not some gamefeel wizard. He frequently neglects gamefeel in favor of simpler, more accessible mechanics. It's only with this newest game that he's decided to walk back on that a little, and as a result Ultimate already looks to be a massive improvement on the Smash 4 formula.

This theory posits that Domeric is the first reek.

Hypothesis 1: Domeric was fathered by a southern lord, not Roose.

Evidence 1: Domeric seems to be well-liked. He plays the harp and enjoys horsemanship, traits of a southerner. No mention of his eyes being the same as color as Roose's eyes. No Bolton Madness to be mentioned. It is mentioned that Roose's wives prior to Fat Walda did not make a sound during sex with him. When Roose discusses Reek, he mentions that ""even his blood smelled bad.""   


The rest of this theory hinges on you accepting this point, so from henceforth let us accept that Domeric was not Ramsey's son for the sake of argument.

Hypothesis 2: Roose found out, and gave Domeric to Ramsey.  


Evidence: Roose is the kind of man that would flay you for spilling his wine. Why does he suddenly decide Ramsey deserves to be his heir? He basically writes Domeric off and promotes Ramsay. Why? Because Ramsey has Roose's bad blood and psychotic tendencies, as all true boltons do. Ramsey has the Bolton eyes, as all true Boltons do.   


What better way for someone as loco as Roose to exact revenge than to give his cuckold son to his bastard son?  


Ramsey reekifies him. He castrates him so that he is no longer a threat to Ramsey's position as heir, as he can't continue the line. He makes him wear flowers in his hair for the same reason. To illustrate the point that this is no true Bolton. For deigning to be a Bolton son.

Hypothesis 3: ""Reek"" comes from ""Dom-Air-Reek""  


Seriously, do we know how Domeric is pronounced? Is it Dom-Air-Rick or Dom-Air-Reek. It is mentioned that a maester diagnosed Domeric with a sickness of the bowels. If this sickness was causing his stench, and the last syllable of his first name is pronounced as ""Reek"", then what better way would there be for Ramsay to dehumanize him?   


The Bolton was stripped from his name, Ramsay stole it. But that wasn't enough for Ramsay. To rub salt in the wound, he stole the ""Dom-Air"" part of his name too.  


Ramsay systemically stripped him of his very name, just as he stripped him of his identity.  


He was Domeric Bolton.  


When Roose found out he was not a true Bolton, he arrived at Ramsay's abode as only Domeric.  


And after Ramsay's torture, he was left with only Reek.  


This is the origin of Reek.

Really nice story ... if you still have her number, call her out of work ... it would be nice to tell her how you felt that day, and to be grateful to her!	NoFap	NoFap	-1
1162	Hmm alright, so basically they just want more games? Because bo3 doesn't equal more games, they would just change to double elim and not have any group stage, allowing for people to get bracket fucked.	OR buy your own wards because it's just 1-2 creep because u are getting the highest farm and stop whining about ur poor support player who is sacrificing his fun just to support u. And when he succeeds the core player can be happy about kills and brag like he's on top of the world.	DotA2	DotA2	-1
1163	Or any object. A person who cannot name at least five objects they can use to open a bottle is not the kind of person you'd like to get stuck with in the apocalypse. 	Got it. In the US there are signs to shower before entering the pool but it's never been enforced. I never did, and would refuse if told to before a race. 	LifeProTips	LifeProTips	-1
1164	0.5g would be plenty to hold an atmosphere (even an Earth-like one), depending on other conditions. For example, the surface gravity of Mars is barely 1/3 that of Earth, and Mars had a substantial atmosphere for millions of years. Really the *only* reason it no longer has an atmosphere is because geological activity largely stopped many millions of years ago. Having a magnetic field can help, but geological activity is by far the most important factor in atmosphere thickness. 	"PASS:

1. Pull the pin on fire extinguisher

2. Aim at base of fire (i.e. at the fuel source, not the flame)

3. Squeeze handle

3. Sweep left and right


RACE:

1. Rescue anyone trapped

2. Activate fire alarm

3. Confine the room (close the doors and windows)

4. Extinguish the fire (or Evacuate if you cant or not sure). First make sure you are not trapped."	askscience	askscience	-1
1165	True, but you have conservatives like Jeff Flake who pretend to hate Trump to save face but still votes with him an overwhelming majority of the time. 	"These questions have a good balance of self-indulgent ‚Äúquestions I just gotta know‚Äù and questions about his craft and the way he works in his medium. Good job!

P.S. The Beatles and Led Zeppelin are my two favorite bands, and I‚Äôd also LOVE to see this happen "	IAmA	IAmA	-1
1166	"You're incorrect. 

Some Catholic schools are public institution hybrids which receive some state funds for education programs. The condition is that money does not get used for religious education. 

&gt;[Under regulations of the U.S. Department of Education, **Catholic schools may receive services provided by federally funded education programs.** Schools in the Archdiocese generally participate in one or more programs authorized by the current version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \(ESEA\) \(As amended by Every Student Succeeds Act of 2016 \(ESSA\).](http://archstl.org/education/page/federal-education-programs)"	"If you‚Äôre talking about the most recent trial, which was talked about quite a bit online, men did not back out of it.

1168	"It is by far the simplest MH game to date, as someone that has played every MH game in the past.

I understand that some people will like the lack of depth when it comes to armour customization, but for myself and my group of friends, we found it a very disappointing feature to have lost.

It's not a *bad* game, at all, but for me it's really lacking a lot of the charm that I personally got from the series."	Given that they‚Äôre also constantly sinking ships and then resurrecting them from the bottom of the sea, I don‚Äôt think the sails are the chief concern	gaming	gaming	-1
1169	"I don't believe that drug laws are currently under provincial jurisdiction, and I wouldn't expect decriminalization to change that. The provinces don't have the legal right to implement drug-related law.

Traffic laws and alcohol policy *are* provincially regulated."	The AI's score correlates with the average score given by a group of humans. I don't think it's even supposed to be compared with an individual person's subjective view.	worldnews	worldnews	-1

1171	"The trouble there is that you imply there could be a conclusion to the series. Ending any kind of fiction is the worst possible thing for the IP holder, which is why so many shows and game series just won't die when they should and drag on for way too long.

But you're sort of close to the original plan for the series, which as I understand it was a trilogy where Desmond gained skills from his ancestors through the bleeding effect in order to have a final game where he was a full-fledged Assassin in the modern day. Ending the series was presumably deemed unprofitable sometime between Brotherhood and Revelations, so it went out the window."	It‚Äôs more of a character shooter. Team Fortress pioneered the genre, but Overwatch definitely refined it for the modern age. A lot of similar games ended up copying their archetypes.	Games	Games	-1

They look better than every other athletic short that I have ever seen which is nice, they are made well, and they‚Äôre super comfortable to wear.  Not outrageously baggy like many other offerings either. They definitely can work as swim shorts in a pinch (always a plus) and they dry fast as well. 

The different inseam lengths most of them come in and the lined/unlined option makes them more versatile depending on what you want as well.

If you're too jealous to maintain an open relationship where your wife has relations with other men, but not with other women... when you peel back the layers on that onion, it's because you don't see women as a threat or as something to be jealous of

He can and his wife can both be assholes, that's their right. And it's our right to inform them"	Thanks for some perspective! I‚Äôve got anxiety as well so I get it, I just wanna do the right thing to ease her mind. 	relationships	relationships	-1
1175	"If I remember correctly, I started with some eyeshadows by Essence I found in clearance - it was frosty pink, frosty champagne, bright light green, yellow and two very bold light and dark shimmery duo shadows in blue and sea green. I just used one of them all over my lid and sometimes paired it with thin black liquid liner. I also smudged some brown or black pencil under my lower lashline. Then I got a pink/burgundy and a champagne/brown eyeshadow quads and started creating more elaborate eye looks.  
I only had two lipsticks at that point - Barely there (brownish nude) and Natural beauty (pinky nude), also by Essence. I wore my first bold lip after like two years of really getting into makeup.  
I know the whole thing can be really intimidating. What helped me was also my budget (I was a university freshman), those funky eyeshadows in clearance were all I could afford, so I played with them.  
Eyeshadows are generally a fun and safe bet for experimenting.  
  
I'd recommend getting:  

* a natural palette, something like [this](https://cdn.makeupandbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essence-Quattro-Eyeshadow-in-05-To-DieFor.jpg) or one of the [Makeup Revolution London Iconic palettes](http://maklinamakeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Untitled-1.jpg) - these are basically cheap but great complete knock offs of the Urban Decay Naked palettes and you can find tons of tutorials with them on Youtube
* a black liquid liner (unless you're really fair and blonde) 
* black and brown eyeliner pencil
* some mascara (stay away from the huge curved brushes, they are usually just gimmicks and I found them really hard to work with, stick with brushes that look like first, second or fourth from the left on [this picture](http://fazewp.fazemediainc.netdna-cdn.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mascara-wands.jpg)
* some pinky or mauvy nude lipstick/lipgloss - stay away from the really NUDE concealer-looking ones, they probably won't look good on you
* you can sweep the clearance rack in your drugstore, you'll probably find some fun bright eyeshadows like blue or green, since nobody really wants them 
* you can use your fingers for eyeshadows but I'd recommend getting at least a smaller [pencil brush](https://cdn.makeupandbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Essence-Smokey-Eye-Brush-4.jpg) and a bigger fluffy [blending brush](http://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2297496?$detail$) . You can get them in the drugstore or, like me, from Aliexpress for like a dollar each.  

I know it sounds like a lot but in reality it's like six products, most of which you probably already have anyway. Then it's all about having fun."	That‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôs good you tried them first! I reaaaally want the new abh highlighter but I‚Äôm maxed out on $$ spent on make up for a while lol  I‚Äôm hella tempted to get the too faced rainbow strobe highlighter buuut there‚Äôs an ulta brand version that actually looks better online.

1176	Hell yeah! I wrote a literary review on the efficacy of virtual reality in the mental health field for a psychopathology course in undergrad a few years ago. Back then there were only a few but EXTREMELY promising peer-reviewed studies with some mind-blowing applications. Really incredible stuff. I'm 100% convinced that by the time I receive my Doctor of Psychology (PsyD) VR will be ubiquitous with mental health and I will be using it with my patients. I could go on and on about the applications it gets me so excited	Simple typos typically don't change the human-interpreted meaning of a report whereas the types of substitution errors created by these voice-to-text algorithms can greatly change the meaning of a sentence.

1177	"It's probably exactly what the Republicans want, too. They'll claim they did what they were asked, and campaign on the idea that a liberal governor had some liberal from California draw up new districts for the hard working people of rural Pennsylvania. The redrawn districts they came up with were probably never intended to pass muster. They were made to fail, so as to give them ammunition to use against the Dems in the elections to come. 

Or at least it seems that way to me."	I remember hearing about those no go zones while I was still active duty.  Didn‚Äôt exist back then.  Don‚Äôt exist now.	politics	politics	-1

1180	Lots of businesses are risky, and lots of Americans live in financially tenuous situations. Why do farms and farmers deserve special treatment, and particularly corn producers? Safety net programs should be broad-based, not limited to particular industries.	"But with mortgages there is tangible collateral.  Even in bankruptcy you have a leveraged asset that can be sold with a mortgage.  Not so with a student loan. I think the premise was to keep student loan rates reasonable to provide lender protection from bankruptcy, but it still doesn‚Äôt make it good policy in all situations.

1181	Fold t-shirts, sweaters, and stuff that I don't wear very often (formal shirts).  Hang casual shirts, to save on ironing.  I just use plastic hangers (and a few wooden hangers for suits and jackets).	"I'm interning at a certain web-hosting tech company in NYC this summer and I'm not sure what to wear. The work environment overall is pretty casual and I'm quite certain there is no (strict) dress code.

I was planning on mainly wearing chinos, sometimes jeans, with a sports shirt (button down), polos, or plain t shirts. However I'm not sure what shoes to wear and was also looking for shoe recommendations. Any advice or clothes suggestions?"	malefashionadvice	malefashionadvice	-1
1182	I grew up poor, never worried about healthcare or food because we had Medicaid and Food Stamps. Now I'm working a full-time job and bartending on the side to barely scrape by with no health insurance. Can my life end yet? 	"I'm so sorry this happened to you. :(

Can you describe what the experience of chemotherapy feels like?

1183	"My point was that r/pureasoiaf is not *the* sub for book readers because almost every book reader discusses the books here, not there. That subreddit is not well known, it has only 24k subscribers and it is created solely to avoid the show altogether where you can't mention the show even if want to criticise it. The general subreddit where most book readers go to discuss the books is r/asoiaf and hence the book fans who are completely invested in the world, the characters and the story that Martin has created venting their frustration about the show in here is completely natural and silly to complain about.

1184	"I established an elevator rule:
If I will get there faster using the stairs, I take the stairs. Works out well since the elevator in our apartment building is A. slow as growing grass and B. almost never on the right floor - and I live on floor 3 so usually I get up/down by stairs in about the time it would take for the elevator to reach my starting point."

1185	What's with Reddit's Facebook hate boner. Use it as a chat program, send funny pictures once in a while. It doesn't have to be a huge thing.	"I think you guys need to spend more time and money doing science, especially allowing different, sometimes competing, point of views. Instead of downvoting me or write stories in propaganda style. You will have more respect from me if you actually are serious, objective scientists, not behaving like some politicians that got triggered when someone express their different opinions or questions.

1186	"We are also a family of 3.  My husband eats a lot because he does a few marathons a year so he's always training and my son is 8.5 and is starting to eat a lot more as he gets older.  We spend about $75 a week on groceries and we go out to eat or get takeout once or twice a week.

I base my meals around what happens to be on sale at the supermarket.  So, if chicken thighs are on sale that week we probably will do things like chicken tacos one night, chicken curry the other, etc.  And I make a lot so we can have leftovers or freeze the leftovers for easy meals on busy days.  I always keep frozen veggies and some kind of meat in the freezer for a quick and easy meal.  I also always keep rice and pasta on hand.  This year I joined a farm share and the veggies are about a third of the price at a regular grocery store which is helpful, too.

No shit you would get lost in blighttown and never in Ds3 (and even 2). Can't get lost following a line.

These story elements are absolutely not present in every game. No other game has one ending locked behind npc quests, and no other game has bullshit quests like Ds3 (it's usually meet the guy and talk to him until he repeats and poof quest done). The whole ""other people are on a journey too"" is a really good idea don't get me wrong (even though lothric doesn't really lend itself well to it with its patchwork structure), but the execution blows.

I couldn't even finish DS3. It's spam roll and R1 until you win or try again. No tactics involved. You talked about movement based combat and I'm not seeing it. Or I am seeing it, but it's not great. Ds1 and Ds2 (because of #dudesinarmor) had slow, methodic combat. It almost feels like a dance if you know what you're doing. In Ds3 it's an absolute mess where you run like a headless chicken until you get your footing and get a few hits in... That's not great.

1200	No matter how they sounded like english speaking people always change them anyway. This kind of thing used to annoy me but I learned to adopt. It‚Äôs too late now considering our mentality now is we can say however we want, just like we can be whatever we want. 	"They *do* have antiderivatives. [The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus) allows us to use integrals to construct antiderivatives to any nice function that you can ""easily graph"". For instance, an antiderivative of sin(x)/x is the function Si(x) that outputs the integral from 0 to x of (sin(t)/t)dt. This is a function, it is differentiable and its derivative is sin(x)/x (due to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus), so it is an antiderivative of sin(x)/x. This is the [Sine Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_integral#Sine_integral).

Now, it doesn't have an antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. We should expect this kind of thing to happen fairly often. It is analogous to squares and integers. With integers, you can explicitly compute N^(2) for any integer N. This is thanks to the niceness of multiplication, which gives us algorithms to compute it efficiently. But, given an integer N, it is much harder to solve the equation x^(2)=N explicitly. In fact *most of the time* the solution to this equation is not itself an integer, even though we started with one. We can compute this solution, using roots, but we often leave the real of nice-simple-easy numbers and get into irrational numbers.

If we have an elementary function f(x), then the Chain Rule and Product Rule allow us to easily and explicitly compute the derivative f'(x). But, given a function f(x), it is must harder to solve the equation y'=f(x). A solution to this is like taking a square root, sometimes, if you're lucky, you get a solution that is also an elementary function, but most of the time you should expect the solution to be an ""irrational function"" (or, non-elementary). But, just like roots, a solution usually exists. For square roots we apply the square root to get an irrational solution. For function we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to get ""irrational solutions""."	askscience	askscience	-1

Once he told me that Phillip Morris used to give them a complimentary cigarette allowance - he'd go into work on Monday and they'd have left a pack of PJ 30 dark blues on his desk every week. For *some reason* they could only leave them on desks, not hand them directly to the workers. The guy didn't even smoke. I visited their factory in Port Melb at some point around then and it was one of the few at that point that still permitted smoking in the lunch room.

He was a super pedantic auditor and rode me fairly hard on lots of issues. They'd just had a salmonella problem with their peanut butter so were clamping down on all suppliers to push the risk down the chain.

We had nothing to do with peanut butter and met all their standards to that point but had to change about a million things to meet the new audit standards. So when he required me to change our pest control program in a cardboard warehouse from poison baits (cruel) to glue boards (super cruel), I made a point of using Kraft peanut butter as the bait for the glue boards.

1211	"*Some* personality is heritable, not all--as far as I was aware that was mainstream science. You're saying personality traits are *not* partly heritable?

The explanation does explain the increased rates because in communities with large amounts of absent fathers it tends to be the case that dudes who are  v desirable to women have way more kids and those personality traits spread through the next generation. I think this is R vs K theory I believe. In my experience the types of dudes to be absent fathers often have lots of kids by various 'baby mommas'.. almost by definition the guys who are the opposite of that personality type tend to have all their children with a single mother.

I think the genetic thing works on both the female and the male so women who are irresponsible are also more likely to have kids who are irresponsible and women who are irresponsible are more likely to fuck up their relationship or cause their dude to leave or kick him out etc.

Definitely didn't say women don't have negaitve personality traits. Just that those negative personality traits are probably largely set from a young age and possibly from birth and to the degree that they are caused by environment is has proven difficult to show that they can be changed through X intervention (putting them into a better home for example).

And the children can have negative outcomes from losing a father. The prime one being sadness and grief. The question is whether it affects consciousness and long-term planning. My argument is that it *might* and it *might not* and I'd like to know if what I said in my OP had been disproved yet.

"With people fetishes as opposed to object fetishes, there's generally an expectation that the person fulfills a number of other requirements, often stereotypes. For a different example, a lot of people with *fetishes* for black men imagine that they are more animalistic and dominant and masculine. This is different from *attraction* to black men, which has more to do with things like melanin, and actually leaves room for black men to be individual, diverse humans with things like personalities. (It's possible to have consensual, empowering relationships involving these kinds of fetishes, but it's complicated and not for most people.)

If your attraction to chubby men a little taller than you is because you expect them to meet some stereotypes around that, such as eating a lot and never exercising (and, um, something something about that particular height), then it may be a fetish and be aware that these are stereotypes rather than facts.

Higher profits in the most current quarter/year don't erode from inflation like further-out future cash flows do.

1283	"Yup. 30+ years of studies have also shown that the reason why autism is so prevalent is because it tends to run in certain, sometimes widepread and major, families and communities (i.e. the so-called ""Silicon Valley phenomenon / effect"", citing the work of Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, PhD, University of Cambridge). If memory serves me correctly, 100+ different inheritable gene changes or mutations have been linked with genetic predisposition towards some form of autism.

Case in point, Sir Isaac Newton, today, is strongly suspected to have possessed some form of autism or certain autistic traits, along with other notable engineers, scientists, and mathematicians (i.e. Nikola Tesla himself, Albert Einstein, et al.). These studies have also shown up to a 3-4x higher rate of autism diagnosis in families with members predominantly in these fields, indicating potential (unconcious) selection for autistic traits.*

Autism has also been shown, via brain mapping (citing the studies of test subject / autistic professor Temple Grandin), in recent years to be linked to drastic changes in the brain. Case in point, Albert Einstein's brain was preserved after his death; noted to be ""drastically different"" in some regards; and is still intensely studied by scientists today. These ""drastic differences"" are theorized to be the reason as to why these individuals are so different in their thinking."

1295	"&gt; The majority of iPhone sales, which is what I was talking about.

The majority of people are idiots who don't pay attention to anything.  They do what other people do.  As we saw with the Net Neutrality, the general public doesn't know what it's getting into until what they once enjoyed is now gone.

&gt; If someone purchases an iPhone, despite wanting a headphone jack, that is them choosing the phone over a feature. Which means they don't particularly care about that feature.

If Apple had a concurrent model of the iPhone 8/X with a headphone jack and it sold worse than the one without one then I'd agree with you but as I said Apple has a specific ecosystem that makes it a ton harder to leave.  Many people have still bought an iPhone despite wanting a headphone jack because they're locked into the ecosystem.  They can care and still continue to buy the products, it's not mutually exclusive.

&gt; Someone will keep making phones with them, I'm sure. But it doesn't change the fact there are hundreds of millions people that don't care, or certainly don't care enough for it to matter.

Those millions who don't care enough are part of the issue, just like the hundreds of millions who don't know what net neutrality is and go along with whatever happens like mindless sheep.  The issue is there is no point to this whole change, it's ridiculously anticonsumer yet people are eating up these companies lies.  It's up to the informed to try to spread to people that this is simply the companies trying to screw you out of more money, not to help you in any way shape or form.  At no point has the port done anything to inhibit you from performing any action that a headphone jackless phone could do.  It's a blatant money grab and the trend needs to stop and revert because right now it's just causing more necessary fragmentation because a perfectly working standard across billions of devices is being removed for no good reason with no worthwhile replacement.

Last weekend I was performing improv theatre at a community event. It's usually a fun time where you can be silly and step outside yourself.

One of the games we played was ""arms experts"" where we get two players and two audience members onstage, and the audience members stand behind the players and use their own arms in place of the characters. My audience member was 20 years my senior, and female.

What happened next surprised me. While I was introducing myself, the audience member while standing behind me, reached down and grabbed my genitals open handed and squeezed. I was mortified... but even moreso when the audience just laughed. I didn't want to break down the fourth wall and so I stayed in character, until the scene was over. I probably tried to brush it off but now, a few days later, see how much I was violated.

So my question is, why would the audience just stand there and laugh? People knew that the scene was not scripted.

So now I wonder, Should I have made a scene and ask that the audience member leave? Do I press charges and make an example of the situation? Do I just laugh about it and move on? I'm a bit conflicted at the moment."	MensRights	MensRights	-1

1307	"Reviews in progress aren‚Äôt us being opportunistic; they‚Äôre us making the best of a bad situation. We absolutely never do them when we could‚Äôve instead produced a final review and had it posted in a timely manner, because in my experience that produces less traffic, not more. We only do them when we aren‚Äôt able to get enough access to a game ahead of time, or if a game is so dependent on live servers that we don‚Äôt have confidence that a review based on what we‚Äôve played would be representative of the final experience. 

In that scenario we have two options: we either sit on everything we know so far even though people are hungry for as much information as they can get at that time, or we say what we think so far so that anyone who wants to know can see. It does generate more traffic than posting nothing until we‚Äôve tied a bow on it, but it only generates traffic at all because it‚Äôs something a lot of people want. 

Frankly, I‚Äôm a little bewildered by the hate we get for that. We aren‚Äôt compelling anybody to click on anything they don‚Äôt want to read, and if you want to wait for the final review before you look at it you‚Äôre totally welcome to do so. But other people want it, so we give it to them. 

If you think the final score is the only thing that matters about a review then I suppose this approach could come across as cynical. But we don‚Äôt think about it that way at all. The score is nothing but a code word for a brief summary the reviewer‚Äôs opinion - it will never tell you as much as reading or watching the full justification given for that opinion. That‚Äôs the meat of it. 

Also, in my experience you never, ever want to set hard rules for how much a score has to be affected by any one factor. Doing so will invariably force you to give a score you don‚Äôt personally agree with, which defeats the entire purpose of giving scores in the first place. Again, they‚Äôre code words, not math. It just doesn‚Äôt work to average them out. 

Imagine you have a game with the best single-player campaign ever, which you think deserves a 10, and a terrible multiplayer mode you‚Äôd give a 3. Would it make sense to average out those two scores and give the whole thing a 6.5, even though you want to shout from the rooftops that everyone should play it for the single-player campaign? Personally I think that would be misrepresenting that game to everybody - you‚Äôd be telling single-player fans that it‚Äôs worse than it is and multiplayer fans that it‚Äôs better than it is. "	"Cutscene direction and narrative blend into gameplay are some of my biggest issues. 

Here is a very common problem. I loved Breath of the Wild as most did, but some of the cutscenes drove me nuts with the pacing of dialogue. When someone says something important emotionally, there needs to be a pause sometimes, the words and emotion need to hang in the air and be felt. But instead the dialogue is delivered line after line very quickly like the voice actor did it all at once and was in a hurry. There is a very sisterly scene between two characters in BOTW, and instead of thinking and feeling each lines meaning, one character just looks done while the other sleeps on there lap, and belts out lines quickly. 

That‚Äôs what is so great about The Last of Us, not only did they have excellent dialogue, delivered well, it‚Äôs paced, and directed well.

&gt;**March 18, 2008 Announcement: Facebook Updates Privacy Controls**

&gt;Facebook will be introducing privacy updates that give users more control over the information they choose to share on Facebook. The two main updates taking place are a standardized privacy interface across the site and new privacy options.

&gt;August 27, 2009: Facebook Announces Privacy Improvements in Response to Recommendations by Canadian Privacy Commissioner

&gt;Facebook today announced plans to further improve people‚Äôs control over their information and enable them to make more informed choices about their privacy. These improvements will include new notifications, additions to Facebook‚Äôs Privacy Policy, and technical changes designed to give people more transparency and control over the information they provide to third-party applications.

&gt;**May 26, 2010: Facebook Redesigns Privacy**

&gt;Facebook today responded to user comments and concerns about privacy by announcing it will introduce simpler and more powerful controls for sharing personal information. New settings will give the more than 400 million people who use Facebook the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share, all with just a few simple clicks. In addition, new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third-party applications or websites.

&gt;‚ÄúWhen we started Facebook, we built it around a few simple ideas,‚Äù said Zuckerberg. ‚ÄúWhen people have control over what they share, they want to share more. When people share more, the world becomes more open and connected. Over the past few weeks, the number one thing we‚Äôve heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information. Today we‚Äôre starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier.‚Äù

&gt;**November 29, 2011: Our Commitment to the Facebook Community**

&gt;...I‚Äôm the first to admit that we‚Äôve made a bunch of mistakes. In particular, I think that a small number of high profile mistakes, like Beacon four years ago and poor execution as we transitioned our privacy model two years ago, have often overshadowed much of the good work we‚Äôve done.

&gt;I also understand that many people are just naturally skeptical of what it means for hundreds of millions of people to share so much personal information online, especially using any one service. Even if our record on privacy were perfect, I think many people would still rightfully question how their information was protected. It‚Äôs important for people to think about this, and not one day goes by when I don‚Äôt think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust.

&gt;Facebook has always been committed to being transparent about the information you have stored with us ‚Äì and we have led the internet in building tools to give people the ability to see and control what they share.

&gt;Today, we‚Äôre introducing Privacy Basics, which gives you tips and a how-to guide for taking charge of your experience on Facebook. We‚Äôre also proposing updates to our terms, data policy, and cookies policy to reflect new features we‚Äôve been working on. And we‚Äôre continuing to improve ads based on the apps and sites you use and expanding your control over this kind of advertising. For the next 7 days, you‚Äôll be able to submit comments and suggestions about our updates.

&gt;As part of Data Privacy Day, we‚Äôre introducing a new education campaign to help you understand how data is used on Facebook and how you can manage your own data. We‚Äôre also announcing plans to make your core privacy settings easier to find, and sharing our privacy principles for the first time. These principles guide our work at Facebook.

&gt;Facebook was built to bring people closer together. We help you connect with friends and family, discover local events and find groups to join. We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone ‚Äì including with us. It‚Äôs important that you have choices when it comes to how your data is used. These are the principles that guide how we approach privacy at Facebook.

&gt;**May 11, 2012: Enhancing Transparency In Our Data Use Policy**

&gt;When we launched our redesigned Data Use Policy last year, our goal was to create a more transparent guide to how we use data when people use Facebook. We structured our policy to have a layered design that puts the most important information up front but lets you click on particular topics to see more details. We believe this flexible, transparent format strikes the right balance between simplicity and accessibility. 

[https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2012/05/enhancing-transparency-in-our-data-use-policy/]

#and this: 

&gt;**November 20, 2017: Enforcing Our Policies and Protecting People‚Äôs Data**

&gt;We‚Äôve seen allegations that we don‚Äôt care how people‚Äôs data is used. While it‚Äôs fair to criticize how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it‚Äôs untrue to suggest we didn‚Äôt or don‚Äôt care about privacy. The facts tell a different story.

&gt;We‚Äôve listened to feedback from people who use Facebook, experts in privacy and security, and regulators on how we can do better. We‚Äôve devoted hundreds of people and new technology to enforce our policies better and kick bad actors off our platform. To name just a few examples:

&gt;First, it‚Äôs always been against our policy for a developer to collect data it doesn‚Äôt need to operate its app. But in the past five years we‚Äôve significantly improved our ability to detect and prevent these violations. All apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process where developers must explain how they are going to use what they collect ‚Äì before they‚Äôre allowed to even ask for it.

&gt;Second, when developers are permitted to use our platform, we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time. We introduced this more than three years ago.

&gt;Third, we enforce our policies by banning developers from our platform, pursuing litigation to ensure any improperly collected data is deleted, and working with developers who want to make sure their apps follow the rules.

&gt;We‚Äôre not stopping here. Our privacy program, created in 2012, includes hundreds of people from a variety of teams across the company. This group works with product managers and engineers to protect people‚Äôs data, to give people information about how our features work, and to provide people control over how their data is used. This program is audited as part of a 20-year agreement we have with the US Federal Trade Commission. We‚Äôre held accountable for what we say and what we do.

&gt;Our approach reflects the laws and regulations we have to follow ‚Äì both in the US and around the world ‚Äì but it also reflects something more fundamental. *Facebook may be successful today, but our future isn‚Äôt guaranteed without the trust of the people who choose to come here every day.* It‚Äôs why we promote a culture inside Facebook that questions decisions and that is relentless in finding ways to improve. We‚Äôll continue listening to feedback and finding ways we can do better.

Anyway, if you're interested in getting into listening to podcast, one suggestion I'll make is to download the [pocketcasts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/) app. Along with letting you listen on your phone and computer, it also lets you search top and trending podcasts based on either popularity or genre. 

Some of the AAA podcasts include: 

This American Life - investigative journalism/social commentary

Stuff You Should Know - Learn cool things and cool topics. 

Freakonomics Radio - A deep dive into how economics and data shape the world around us in the strangest ways. 

WTF with Marc Maron - Deep and personal conversations with comedians and pop culture icons. 

Joe Rogan Experience - Think WTF but with a few more controversial figures mixed in. I'll admit, I can't stand Joe Rogan. I think he's a bit of an ass/ignorant and people put his podcast on way too high of a pedestal, but that's my personal taste. You may like him. 

Lore - Learn about mysterious happenings throughout history. 

Those are just some of the biggest name titles. If you're looking for more niche stuff, some of my personal favorites include: 

**Nerdom**

Critical Role - Professional voice actor Mat Mercer and friends play D&amp;D 

Shut Up and Sit Down - SU&amp;SD discusses table top games that they enjoy or hate. 

Epic Audio - Serialized audio epics. Not the best writing in the world, but I find the stories enjoyable. 

**Horror**

Creepy - Audio productions of the most popular creepy pastas. Pretty hit and miss, as most creepy pastas are, but when it it hits, it hits really well. 

Black Tapes - A reporter and a skeptic get involved in a demonic mystery. 

No Sleep Podcast - Scary stories. 

**Conspiracy and Craziness**

Beyond the Darkness - If you like conspiracy theories about aliens, ghosts, bigfoot, or whatever else you can think of, this one is the go-to. 

Mysteries Abound - Think Beyond the Darkness, but with a more soothing host. 

**News and Journalism**

Pretty self-explanatory, so I won't give a description of each. 

BBC Newshour 

Reveal 

New York Times The Daily

NPR Up First

Guardian Long Read 

**Pop Culture**

Almost all of these come from one podcast network, so I'm sure there are others out there, but I really like Frogpants and the hosts they have. 

Film Sack - Think the podcast version of Mystery Science Theater. 

The Morning Stream - a daily chit-chat about pop culture and general fun. 

Boop - a look at the video game industry. 

Like I said, there are a billion different things out there, and I've left some of my favorites off this list, along with other big names you'll probably hear. 

But, if you get into listening enough, you'll find your niche and the most recommended podcasts within those niche's pretty easily. Like I said, the best recommendation I can make is for that app, which I don't work for or anything, but I swear by it.

The Zillow estimate...which you're always told isn't a realistic number, actually is realistic in this market.  It's over 230k now.
Made nearly 100k in equity just buying it.
The same house in MD would've cost me 3x as much.
And the weather is kickass.
But the point is just that...if anyone is longing to buy their first home, keep saving for the next market crash and get in at that time.  Same applies to stock market.  "	news	news	-1

&gt;You are presenting the false dichotomy of either working hard or learning about politics

I didn't present a dichotomy at all. And I didn't say anything about working hard. It's that the work is narrow and time-consuming, not that it is difficult. Getting a PhD in something like herpetology literally means you're spending &gt; 4 years (and typically &gt;6) of your life painstakingly confined to one niche field of study that has no relevance to politics, with very little opportunity to explore other domains. Now, there are some bright PhD students who do find the time to study other things (like politics), but by and large PhDs are extraordinarily time-consuming and energy-consuming. 70 hours a week of confined study is nothing trivial, especially when PhDs have concurrent commitments and are even working another job. 

Hypothetically, let's say a PhD student and a businessman are working the same hours. In business you are dealing face-to-face with politically-relevant matters: the economy, budgeting, social relationships, efficiency, et cetera. Although a limited amount of your job, it transfers to political understanding. But a PhD, in many cases, does not transfer to political understanding. History, *perhaps* English, perhaps philosophy (especially if continental), will definitely transfer to political understanding. But either a sizable minority or a majority of PhD studies do not. This means that even if a PhD and a businessman are working the same hours, the businessman is more likely to be acquainted with politically-relevant ideas or data. 

&gt;people need to learn to think critically which is encouraged in school where an instructor pushes an individual to think critically

I think you are overestimating how different it is to think critically about a political issue as opposed to thinking critically about an essay or an historical phenomena. This sort of ""thinking critically"" is grilled in every American for 12 years of primary education, and I think we can both agree that it hasn't been helping make politically-informed citizens.

I needed a new farming/crafting fix after two years of **Stardew Valley.**  My Time at Portia is still in development, but if the devs flesh out the relationship and story aspects, it will easily be my new favourite relaxation game. I‚Äôve played for 23 hours so far. 


Unlike Stardew, this game focuses on developing your workshop and helping your town. You craft items that allow you to explore a post-apocalyptic world, and develop your community‚Äôs infrastructure, like transit and lighting.  Farming is simplified, crafting is king -- you‚Äôll be mining and logging and killing monsters for components, but you can also grow crops and raise animals on the side. To be fair, I just got two calfs, so I haven‚Äôt explored much of the animal stuff yet.   


There are dungeons with boss fights. Combat is somewhat more challenging than Stardew, although that‚Äôs not saying much.  Portia‚Äôs dungeons do have more interesting obstacles, like dodging giant boulders, but it‚Äôs not hard.


There are regular events that I won‚Äôt spoil here, only to say that they need to be fleshed out imo. I‚Äôve read that players can romance certain NPCs, but I haven‚Äôt encountered that yet, and any kind of improved relationship or story elements would be greatly welcomed.  The dialogue needs improvement, and some lines fall incredibly flat. My Time at Portia is currently a rough sketch still being coloured in. 


This game feels super-grindy right now, possibly because the story is still being worked on.  Stardew Valley‚Äôs interpersonal aspects really made that game shine and gave it a charm that is currently missing in Portia. There are basic beginnings of a better story, as if the developers left anchors for future plot development. I really hope this is true, because that‚Äôs exactly what this game needs.

The squeeze and non-squonking pico mods have all been pretty solid so eleaf's rep is pretty good to me.  I do have an anita but don't like it.  Feels too cheap in the hand and I'm just not into mods with the squonk hole in the side panels.  I expect an all metal squeeze 2 to be a pretty solid mod.  	"I see many of great advises here but I am sort of a newbie with RDAs - only couple of months into it - so maybe you could use my revelations and tips too:

1.)    Easy to start ‚Äì it is soo easy to have it up and running. Before switching to RDA I had one RTA (Ammit) and the whole wicking process was more finicky there. One slightly thinner wick and juice all over the place. Too much wick, dry hits coming. Until you get the hand of it.. With RDAs, there are so less room for an error if you are beginner.

2.)    Coils ‚Äì yeah, it is way cheaper than non RBAs but also the opportunities for exploration are really huge. I tried various types of coils and wire which provided me total different vape experience. And that pure feeling of joy and excitement  is something that also gives me an additional boost with the overall vaping experience. Cos if you want, you can have something totally different whenever you want. OK, now I know what I like (Ni80, fused claptons and framed staple) and don‚Äôt (SS &amp; Aliens in general) so I usually stick with it. But the feeling that I am not limited to anything makes this more overwhelming experience overall. Later, when u find out what you like and if you don‚Äôt want to build coils by yourself, I will advise to go with more quality and handmade coils. When I started I bought loads of deamon kiler, coilology coils so I can play and test all of them. They are really nice thing to start with but usually don‚Äôt last a lot. Now I buy some local handmade coils where the pair of coils is priced almost more than the whole package of branded ones but the overall flavor and longevity I get from them simply cannot be compared with Chinese coils.

3.)    Play with your builds ‚Äì just play and experiment. Before I started I couldn‚Äôt believe that even a slightest difference I coil placement can make a difference. But that is so true. Don‚Äôt be afraid to redo your build if you are not satisfied. I spent soo much cotton and juice on my Drop RDA until I found a perfect placement for my style of vape. It took some time but now I am enjoying every single puff I take.

4.)    Maintenance ‚Äì take care of your coils and clean them often. Usually I rewick every two days and also clean my coils during the process. Also, at least once per week I fully clean my RDA. Sometimes also more often, in case I am switching to a new flavor.. Maybe it‚Äôs too much, but I like to keep it clean and tidy :)

1390	"&gt;Women will find themselves wondering if they should resent men and men will feel guilty for sins committed by other men. Women are not going to find this message appealing and men will find themselves feeling even more awkward

I dunno man, in my experience no one can make you feel guilty. Maybe there is some deeper unresolved issue. I'll just give you example from a time in my life when my mindset was completely, and guilt and shame for being a man was at the top of my list.   


As men we get TONS of messages around what it means to be a man. The biggest conflict for me came from not wanting to be THAT guy. The stereotypical misogynist , sexist or all the bad things that are attributed to men. But also feeling inferior because I didn't get the girl, or I didn't get &lt;insert thing of desire&gt;. Were told ""Nice Guys Finish Last"", were told to need to be Alpha's, and ourself worth is either how many women we can bed, or how much money we have in our pocket.   


So all when we have all this  frustration with our situations, it starts to sting when people say we have an advantage (privilege). We go into defensive mode... because we feel its a personal attack on us, which is outrageous... I have problems...  my problems matter you don't have my problems, you have X,Y and Z easy. Yada yada yada... It quickly devolves into a race to who has it worse instead into a conversation around hey lets have some empathy and work to make life better for each other.   


Ultimately Feminists can change the messaging, but I don't think its gonna change the reaction or even your own feelings of guilt when the underlying human flaw is to always gonna protect its ego. I'd rather ask... hey what exactly are you feeling guilty about, because NO ONE is saying it Not OK to be Man... But I'm sure you feel that way. Why?"

1393	The Venn diagram linking obsessively watching obscure anime, and theoretical mathematics. I think I can say with a degree of certainty that the mysterious maths expert is a man in his late teens or early 20s.    	"It is a large and complex problem, but we should try tackling it before our oceans are endless wastelands full of trash and no life. Countries around the world should be developing fisheries on land in separate environments and farming techniques that can sustain their whole population. Its not a matter of if we will fish all the fish in the ocean, it is a matter of when? 

&gt;A major threat to both this crucial intermediate trophic level and the entire upwelling trophic ecosystem is the problem of commercial fishing. Since upwelling regions are the most productive and species rich areas in the world, they attract a high number of commercial fishers and fisheries. On one hand, this is another benefit of the upwelling process as it serves as a viable source of food and income for so many people and nations besides marine animals. However, just as in any ecosystem, the consequences of over-fishing from a population could be detrimental to that population and the ecosystem as a whole. In upwelling ecosystems, every species present plays a vital role in the functioning of that ecosystem. If one species is significantly depleted, that will have an effect throughout the rest of the trophic levels. For example, if a popular prey species is targeted by fisheries, fishermen may collect hundreds of thousands of individuals of this species just by casting their nets into the upwelling waters. As these fish are depleted, the food source for those who preyed on these fish is depleted. Therefore, the predators of the targeted fish will begin to die off, and there will not be as many of them to feed the predators above them. This system continues throughout the entire food chain, resulting in a possible collapse of the ecosystem. It is possible that the ecosystem may be restored over time, but not all species can recover from events such as these. Even if the species can adapt, there may be a delay in the reconstruction of this upwelling community.

Thantis is actually a deceptive card. Boring at first look, but after having some time to muse on it, I see what they were going for now. The trick is that the abilities *by themselves* are not considered strong, but having all of them on one card makes a synergistic effect that is pretty good. With one card, you are forcing your opponents to attack into an ever growing monster, which will crack back (with most if not all of their team tapped) for commander dmg and then be back on defense.

So the floor on this card (besides constantly being counterspelled) is you're in a field full spellflinger decks with no creatures to speak of, and you play a 5/5 commander with almost no relevant abilities. 

The ceiling, however, its quite high, with utility creatures forced to crash in against you or your opponents, leaving you open to eat said creatures with your commander and other good creatures on your board. If they only attack other opponents, well then you have a repeatable pesudo-[disrupt decorum] effect, which is amazing against other creature heavy decks. 

The problem? It's 6 daggum mana and has no way to protect itself from removal or deathtouch. 6 mana does mean it won't come down till people have begun to build up their boards, when it's ability actually matters, but it also means it has to start swinging the game in your favor pretty fast to be worth the investment and inevitable repayment of commander tax.

1410	"&gt;Would a Dad with a 8 month old baby be able to enjoy a game like this?

Sure. You can sit down and play for 10 minutes *or* 10 hours. With the new missions structures, free roam, and bounty systems you can spend as little time or as much time as you want and still make progress.

I often play while i cook, and that forces me to stop playing every 5 minutes to make sure the food doesnt burn. But even without pausing, the generous 50 minute time limit on every quests means you can take breaks even in the middle of quests. And most missions will not take beyond 15-20 minutes, especially if you play online with half decent players.

Previous titles were big in Japan *because* you could play Monster Hunter for short periods of time and still make progress. Lunch breaks, on the bus, in the cubicle while waiting for more work, the missions structure isnt ""run this dungeon thats 3 hours long"". Its, ""Spend 5 to 30 minutes per quest, and choose what you want to do"". With world, you cant do that on the go, but with an 8 month old baby you're probably spending a lot of time with 30 feet of the TV anyway.

You can *very* easily in 15-20 minute chunks off and on throughout the day. If you end up with more time, you can play longer. If you end up with less time, you can just free roam with *infinite time* to do things and *no fail conditions.*

I wont say, ""This is the perfect game for a person with an 8 month old baby"", but Monster Hunter has always been a series of, ""Let me sneak in a 10 minute quest while no one is looking"". And world does that *better* than previous games."	"&gt; The only solution is moving mining to custom hardware, which seems unlikely for the time being.

How do you mean, Scala comes with flatMap, map, fold, reduce, etc. out of the box, and for comprehensions are Scala's answer to Haskell's `do` notation. Implicits and higher kinded types provide the machinery for encoding type classes. Sure, typeclass definitions are more verbose than Haskell, but they're equally (if not more) powerful.

Anyway, compared to Haskell and the ML family every statically typed language is verbose. At least with Scala you can actually match Haskell feature for feature; the same cannot be said for other mainstream-ish languages."	"Agree... but:

Actually the situation is much worse.
Think a minute about how computers are used these days: Most of them are single-user, most (private data) living in user space. These days I would argue that kind of data is usually *way* more important to protect than the operating system around it.

Think about:

* SSH private key
* pass/keypass/whatever keystore database
* Browser password autocomplete data storage
* Credentials somewhere in your code project folders for deployment/testing/whatever
* Cryptocurrency stuff I assume? (no idea about that tbh)

All of this can (for most common system configurations) be uploaded to an attackers web space just by executing arbitrary code in *user space* (or deleted for that matter).

Thats not to say your point is not valid, of course there can be even more damage done as root, but keeping everything in user space these days just cuts of a fraction of attack vectors.

1453	"&gt;but I would prefer that they crtitiicized both sides.

But that's the problem. Each individual issue doesn't have ""both sides"". Sometimes we don't know the truth and experts can disagree, but that disagreement isn't binary. Politics in America involves a two party system due to our winner take all system, but that is not how reality works. And sometimes we do know the answer and 'both sides' is diluting the truth, not strengthening it.

The President attacked the free press this morning. That's a truth that shouldn't be 'both sides'ed. Bringing up how in 2017 a reporter from CNN factually reported that he and the Prime Minister dumped fish flakes as if this is some sort of 'counter-point' to a direct attack on a free media, is emblematic of the problem. 

""Both sides""ing is how we got to this place. Honesty even when it draws outrage is how we get out.

&gt;Overall, I just prefer news to be in the middle, rather than spew left or right propoganda.

There is literally no such thing as a 'middle' in terms of political opinion. Everyone's 'middle' is a purely subjective construct from where they stand. While there are some basic factual disagreements (climate change, health care costs, conspiracy theories) almost all of it is a matter of values. And demanding the news place their values in the middle of people who want gay people accepted, or suppressed, want unions busted, or supported, who don't care about corruption, and who do, is how you get the media to the weakened point it's in now.

Trump should never have been elected. Regardless of the racial and economic factors he was playing to, if we'd had an honest media discussion of exactly what the man is like, he wouldn't have been elected. He has always been a joke and a criminal, an admitted sexual predator and an imbecile for every matter of substantive policy. But the media did what you asked. They simply reported facts about what candidates did, and whenever Trump was criticized, they felt they had to 'both sides' it, even if that meant bringing on people who'd just lie to defend him, or criticizing Hillary when it had no merit. 

Honest journalism means you don't align your speech to what the other person considers moderate to them, or pretend both sides of every argument should be given equal weight. 

The President attacked the free press. Can't we actually talk about that and it's consequences, instead of making the exact same mistake that got us here, by hand-wringing that honest journalists who are trying should maybe be less critical for the sake of appearances?"

On top of that, looking around the web at verizon's OWN forums, it looks like they aren't even actually letting anyone get that plan yet!

Their only offering for individual first responders is an ADDITION to an already-existing account, that must be post-paid, that simply puts a maximum of two lines as prioritized, and ONLY data OR voice, you can only prioritize a line on one service.  There's a significant process to join, and that is also apparently getting fucked according to their forums.  Verizon's responses have, of course, been a bunch of canned responses of ""please PM us to work with you"".

And while Verizon's network may be a bit larger, ATT's FirstNet offers:

I'm also deathly afraid of getting nic sick :)	"Yup, always make sure the coils aren't touching anything and the leads aren't touching the other coil if you are building on a dual coil RDA. 

Another tip is to buy an ultrasonic cleaner to clean your coils once you've wrapped them so you don't vape the oil, sweat and the other crap from your hands that gets on them. That is of course only necessary if you don't use powder-free gloves when building.

For cleaning gunked up coils people say to glow the coils and then run them under water, but I don't like the idea of getting all the crap in tap water on my coils so I personally pulse the coil and then take a small brass welders brush and give it a nice scrubbing. Plus if you use SS they can rust, and sometimes with cheap kanthal as the contain iron.

Also stick to either kanthal, nichrome or SS for your metals as those require less care when building as nickel and titanium can produce harmful compounds if you heat them to high. Even with SS you need to be careful when dryburning as it can degrade the metal and mess it up chemically. There's a video out there that goes over the proper care and methods for cleaning SS coils, but I don't have a link. Personally I use nichrome as it gives good flavor and I have to worry less than with SS and I don't use TC. 

Also make sure you check the ohms on a regulated mod or an ohm reader of the coils after you have them wicked because it will change. It doesn't usually change much for simple round wire builds, but it does and its just kind of a step I've always done because I'm used to building for mechs. If you ever move to more complex builds like claptons or fused claptons it can change quite a bit because you'll have hotspots, little shorts between the outer wrappings, and that can change the ohm readings once you have the hotspots out and the coils glowing properly.

1496	I agree with everything except ephemeral. People overhype ephemeral way too much. You people forget that this was a genjutsu put on Naruto first of all and that Itachi can‚Äôt just point at someone and immediately put them under genjutsu. I don‚Äôt know if this was exactly explained in the anime or manga but in the Itachi Shinden novel it was explained that in order to put someone under genjutsu both of your axis‚Äô of chakra must align with one another, this is why sharingan genjutsu is so powerful because it‚Äôs used by looking into the opponents eyes which perfectly aligns the two axis‚Äô of chakra. The reason Ephemeral worked on Naruto, well for one it‚Äôs Naruto who at the time was someone pretty easy to catch under even the simplest genjutsu, is because Itachi simply concentrated his chakra and genjutsu into his finger. Then Naruto stared directly at Itachi‚Äôs finger for a good 30 seconds and boom the chakra axis‚Äô are aligned and Naruto is successfully under Itachi‚Äôs genjutsu. I highly doubt this genjutsu would work on many other characters, let alone Madara. 	I didn't mind nazi Naruto, I just wish he didn't have the military haircut.

1497	"&gt; many people take it for granted by going to hospital/GPs etc when they really don't need to.

Is that really that much of an issue? I have no idea about the numbers but I would have thought that the cost of a GP consultation would be a lot less than the cost of being hospitalised for something that could have been prevented. Still there wouldn't be as much congestion if they poured more money into it to create a first point of contact that one can go to for issues which are potentially too serious to ignore but might not require a GP expertise."

It's not so much to brag, but to the natural conclusion when a conversation about a popular scripted program that I hadn't watched.  

* Them: ""Did you see the latest episode of GOT?!?""  

* Me: ""No. I don't have a TV.""

I was so annoyed by the TV writer's strike about 10 years ago that I just gave up television.   I was addicted before.  I had to watch TV four hours after work on Wednesdays and this day and that.  I eagerly waited for the next episode of this cheese melodrama or that.  I had cable news before that, but I had gotten burned out on that after Bush's wars and then loosing everything Katrina I turned myself entirely to television.  

This actually goes back to something that happened in Elementary school when my 5th grade English teacher paid his daughters $100 buck not to watch tv for a year.   My little cartoon addicted mind could not comprehend how this was a good deal. 

Granted I went to the internet and started online gaming, but I've not watched really scripted television dramas since.  I watch random video series on Youtube now and then.  Whatever reddit provides or some youtube series like Maangchi, J. Townsend &amp; Sons, or that Primitive Technology guy.   Or... if I do watch television HGTV's House Hunters.

"	"I kind of went through this scam. I was an AT&amp;T customer and they offered me an amount off my bill for trying Direct TV Now free for a week. I think it was like $50. I figured what the hell, $50 bucks is $50 and maybe the service is ok. Anyway, I go through the sign up process with the AT&amp;T rep. Mind you, this was described as a FREE trial, no commitments. So I was a bit off out when he asked for a credit card, but figured it was when you forget to cancel. I figured I wouldn‚Äôt forget and if I did, the monthly bill was only like $30, so I‚Äôd end up +$20 regardless. I gave him my liquid because I usually do that for subscriptions(although sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work). I had money on it, enough to cover the first month for sure, but regardless it got declined. With liquid cards, if you don‚Äôt have the money in the account, it‚Äôll cancel the transaction. It‚Äôs a nice way to avoid overdrafts if you have a lot of subscriptions. I just figured they couldn‚Äôt get the repeating authorization, an issue I get when using liquid cards with Netflix, and gave them my real account. Imagine my surprise when I was charged almost $130 immediately from direct TV. I alerted the rep and he told me that no I didn‚Äôt. I told him I absolutely did get charged $127 and that is not cool. We go back and forth a bit, he has excuses(maybe it‚Äôs an authorization, maybe it‚Äôs a hold, etc). He told me he wouldn‚Äôt be able to reverse whatever he did because he wasn‚Äôt sure what happened, that I should call my bank and then call back. I told him I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in calling back and he had until the end of the day to figure it out and call me back, and I messaged my bank to alert them of the situation and confirm it was a charge. Waited for his call, never got it. I called AT&amp;T a few times trying to resolve it at the insistence of my bank, but you see, DirectTV has separate customer service than AT&amp;T. They can sign you up, offer you discounts on your AT&amp;T bill for signing up, but they can‚Äôt rectify any issues with that process. Long story short, it took forever to get the situation rectified through DirectTV and eventually this led me to leaving AT&amp;T as a customer because I was so frustrated with them.

1514	"One way that I've found to be effective is to first grab the person's email (most people are pretty forthcoming to giving out their email nowadays) and ask if it's okay if I sent them some questions or follow up with them if we were chatting at an event.

Of course the house paint had faded, so the cable still stuck out even though it was the same color. 

Around the same time I was getting written up for parking my plain white cargo van in the driveway (was planning on weekend camper/vandweller/4x4 van build). It was my only personal vehicle, and 100% stock other than some roof bars for utility. No business advertisement, no ladders strapped to it.

"If the website can send code to your browser (which is absolutely commonplace), then that code can evaluate your password as you type it, and in principle could do it without revealing it to any other party.  

In practice, nearly all password authentication implementations communicate the password from the user to the authentication service when the user is enrolled and every time the user authenticates with the password.  (It is possible to design password authentication systems that keep the password secret to just the user, but almost nobody has adopted such systems.  See, e.g., the [Secure Remote Password protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol))

The most-recommended technique for the server to store passwords is for it to throw away the plaintext and store in its records instead a *randomized, costly hash* of it‚Äîan operation that scrambles the password in a way that‚Äôs:

1. Randomized: the same password when scrambled in the scope of two different password entries will produce different results.  (This is achieved with something called a ‚Äúsalt,‚Äù a value that‚Äôs supplied as input in addition to the password.  Salts should ideally be chosen at random with negligible chance of collisions.)
2. Repeatable: Every time the same user provides their password to the server, the latter can reproduce the exact same randomized computation.  (This is achieved by using the same salt each time you verify an user‚Äôs password as was randomly picked when that password was enrolled.  Which requires the salts to be stored along with hash outputs.)
3. One-way: For randomly generated inputs, output of the function is of little help to an adversary that wishes to guess its input.
4. Costly: It is costly for the attacker to compute many instances of the function in parallel, but not too costly for the server to compute it for the users it authenticates.  This should be true even if the attacker uses specialized hardware that is much more efficient at parallel computation than the defender does.  (This is meant to thwart attacks where the adversary exploits the reality that most real-life passwords are much easier to guess than a uniformly chosen random value of the same length.)

Sadly, it‚Äôs very common for organizations to use weak password storage and management practices.  For example, just the other day there was some buzz on Twitter about the fact that Fidelity Investments looks like they may store plaintext passwords.  Programmers also often aren‚Äôt aware of the ‚Äúcostly‚Äù requirement on password hashing, or of the specialized algorithms that have been designed for this application (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).  On the use of ‚Äúsalts‚Äù for randomizing password hashes there‚Äôs also commonly much confusion, with programmers using and recommending practices that aren‚Äôt optimal (ideally salt values should be picked at random)."	askscience	askscience	-1

"You might be thinking of the original ""light fighter"" concept of the F-16. In the 1970's-1980's, as fighter aircraft became heavier, more expensive, and more focused on technology such as bigger radars, bigger payloads, and longer range missiles (think F-14 and F-15, massive twin-engined fighters with big radars and carrying big missiles) . There was a cabal of aircraft designers and high ranking Air Force officers who believed to the contrary, that the optimal fighter is small, cheap, and light, able to close to short range and outmaneuver their larger components and effect a kill with guns or small heat seeking missiles. The original F-16 was essentially this idea, a cheap, highly maneuverable, single engine small fighter.

However as the F-16 aged, it has evolved (for a variety of reasons) from a light air superiority fighter designed to kill bigger, slower fighters, to what is essentially a multipurpose ""bomb truck"". 

They were super cheap so the Air Force has thousands of them, and when the Soviet Union collapsed and the US began fighting small geurilla forces across entire countries, the Air Force suddenly needed a lot fewer fighters and a lot more bombers. So they put bomb racks on them and now they fly over the Middle East and drop laser or GPS-guided JDAM's on people carrying AK-47's."	askscience	askscience	-1

A woman walking into an abortion clinic has made the most difficult and devastating decisions of her life. She's about to do something that will hurt her both physically and emotionally. She wishes more than anything that she didn't have to do what she's doing, but she does. 

Anyone who harasses her, intimidates her, or in any way impedes her on the way through that door is an insensitive, selfish, misogynistic asshole and should be arrested for doing so. 

Clinics in the US (not sure about Canada) are bombarded with threats of violence daily.

1568	"To understand what GitHub is, first you need to know what Git is. Git is a tool created for developers to be able to track changes to their programs in a systematic and logical way. If you've ever had to do a project and ended up having a bunch of files like PROJECT.DOC, PROJECTv2.DOC, PROJECT_FINAL.DOC, PROJECT_TRUE_FINAL.DOC, you can understand the importance of having a way to track versions of a project. These systems are called version control, and Git is a popular one because in addition to this, it also allows for smooth collaboration so that multiple people can collaborate on a project easily (and not end up with PROJECT.DOC and PROJECTv2.DOC on John's computer, PROJECTv2.DOC and PROJECTv3.DOC on Ryan's computer, and PROJECTv2.DOC and PROJECT_FINAL.DOC on Mike's computer). 

Git is decentralized by design; a ""master version"" of the project doesn't sit on any one computer. However, sometimes it's nice to have something that would roughly correspond to a ""master version"", especially for large projects with lots of online contributors, hence the creation of GitHub. GitHub is basically a place where a project can sit as an easily accessible de-facto master version and people can pull and push updates to it in an organized fashion. Git is the underlying technology, but GitHub and friends (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) provides the service of free code hosting for many projects.

One thing that makes GitHub very attractive is that open source software can use it for free. If you don't know what open source software is, suffice it to say that it's software with a greater amount of freedom for its use than traditional proprietary software like Windows. GitHub is incredibly popular for open source developers who generally aren't particularly fond of Microsoft, mostly due to historical squabbles. Some are worried about what will happen to GitHub with Microsoft behind the wheel, some are worried about what will happen to the Atom code editor which is a separate program owned by GitHub the company, which is popular but is also a direct competitor for a Microsoft projects. Some are not worried and some have already kissed GitHub goodbye. Time will tell who is correct."	Pretty much how Media Markt etablished themself in Sweden.

1573	Great question!  In addition to all the anecdotal evidence suggesting that dogs process our emotions (e.g., nearly 100s of YouTube videos), there‚Äôs a growing body of empirical evidence showing that dogs can track and discriminate human emotions from facial expressions. For examples, dogs can tell the difference between different human facial expressions (e.g., a happy smiling human face versus a disgust face), and this probably is at least one of the things they use to decide who's happy and who's sad.	You will, for the time being, never see a lossless video file (using ANY codec) saved to disk or transmitted over the internet in any scenario outside the broadcast industry itself. Even compressed, they are ENORMOUS, and would overwhelm consumer level storage or any kind of general purpose network. And to achieve that compression, you need enough computing power to deal with the incoming massive firehose of uncompressed data, while ALSO being able to run the compression computations on that data, and ALSO being able to store or transmit the slightly smaller firehose of output data once it's been compressed. And you must do all of this in real-time. Generally, this requires dedicated professional-level hardware designed and built explicitly for this purpose, and is not really practical to do with a general purpose PC, no matter how powerful.	askscience	askscience	-1

1582	Christian theologians have accounted for those who lived before Christ but my understanding on this is a bit fuzzy. I think it's said that when Christ died and went to realm of the dead he preached there, or that in descending to the realm of the dead his earthly mission drew the dead to himself. But also it's not like there was no revelation before the incarnation in Christianity either so God wasn't by any means absent in history then either. Even in non-Jewish cultures there were religious expressions which weren't entirely alien to Christian sentiments so there's that too.	Could you clarify what this tangibly means in practice exactly?

There are still 100 times less toxins or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH's) you vape if you compare it to smoking. But still there are a few if you are 100% objective. These all come free with cannabis that is toxinated with pesticides, and other chemicals. A lot of people don't realise that in most cannabis there really is crap that they did put on. People don't seem to realise where the cannabis all went before it goes into your joint or vape. I myselve allready had a few times weed with crap sprayed on. A lot of times you can see it when your joint starts to make cracking sounds, taste weird, or flash shortly. For example it's quite common that people spray hairspray on it for extra weight. That's why biological cannabis is always the right choice (if you have the choice)

The main toxins that could do some sort of harm are Benzene, it's carcinogenic and gets triggered at 80.1¬∞C

Also Naphthalene isn't scientifically officially known as carcinogenic but it has potential. It causes dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite and pale skin, the boiling point is 218 ¬∞C.

We matched on Tinder and talked all day. Never anything sexual, just about stuff we were interested in and all that. The next day we decided to meet up for sushi. We got along well and started hanging out once or twice a week after that. 

We mostly just watched TV shows or movies at his house and cuddled. We would kiss sometimes, slept together once. But we didn‚Äôt have the best physical chemistry, so we mutually decided to just be friends and kept hanging out. 

This continued for a few months. One day I went over on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00 and I couldn‚Äôt wake him up because he was passed out drunk. I knew he drank kind of a lot, but it was after that day that he really opened up to me about his depression and drinking problem. 

He said he wanted to be alone because when he goes through bad spells he doesn‚Äôt like to see people. We texted now and again a few times a week, just checking in. He got help and sobered up but shared a lot of stuff about what he was going through with me and his past. He doesn‚Äôt really have any friends because he didn‚Äôt want people to know he was struggling so he kind of pushed them away.

We don‚Äôt hang out as much anymore, but we still text daily and talk on the phone sometimes. He‚Äôs the only person I text with just to chat even though we‚Äôre both dating other people. 

The reason why it‚Äôs unconventional is because he‚Äôs really the only person I tell EVERYTHING to. I think it‚Äôs because I feel comfortable because he‚Äôs outside my normal group of friends. I live with my best friends but they‚Äôve never met him. I always went to his house because it was close to my work and he never came over mine because he was worried he would drink and drive. 

He also helped me significantly in seeing my ex‚Äôs true colors in a way that my other friends couldn‚Äôt. I was on and off with someone I was in love with for a while and he really helped me see everything clearly but totally understood why I felt the way I did.  

We talk about life stuff, movies, TV, and give each other dating advice.

Yesterday he asked me if I ever through it was weird that we still talk. We started out as a Tinder hookup kind of. And he doesn‚Äôt keep in touch with girls he meets on there because he‚Äôs not looking for a relationship so the flings are pretty short lived.

In other big eSports games, like CSGO or Dota 2, every contents (characters, maps, etc.) update are free while cosmetics aren't.

1607	"Well if it is NOT a full frame lens then you don't apply the crop factor.. in other words, [if it says ""DX""](https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-AF-S-NIKKOR-Focus-Cameras/dp/B001S2PPT0/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525174394&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=35mm+nikon+DX) on it, then it IS a 35mm on your camera not a ""50-55"" (52.5 actually)

The (x 1.5) crop factor would only be applied if you were using a full frame lens ([nikon brand full frame lenses are marked ""FX""](https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-AF-S-NIKKOR-35mm-1-8G/dp/B00HQ4W4XO))



Some quick notes each type of lens in relation to your camera:

DX lenses: fit your camera with no crop factor involved, are lighter and less expensive

FX lenses: are designed for cameras with full frame sensors therefor a crop factor of  x 1.5 is applied making the effective focal length longer, generally higher quality lenses, they are also usually heavier and larger, better coatings on lenses more likely to have better weather sealing, can be used with new camera if you decide to upgrade to a full frame body.

For what you're talking about landscape and nature without switching lenses I'd say 35mm is a pretty good focal length.. you may find yourself wishing you had something just a little wider for the landscapes.. 24mm or lower would be more ideal for that in my opinion..  you could also look into getting a zoom lens if you really didn't want to switch lenses at all.

He's in, what should be, a high scoring offense, and should only see an increase in playing time as the season progresses. It looks like he's slowly being  worked in while Patricia relies on his vets. 

Riddick's playing time has already taken a hit. He has a role, but I don't think it will overlap KJ's very much. 

Blount's role will dwindle as well, though it will probably take a few more weeks. I don't even think he'll be that much of a goal line/touchdown vulture. He's aging and KJ is proving superior in just about every facet. He looks solid in pass-blocking. Solid in catching out of the backfield...

He's not going to be an RB1 at any point, but he'll most likely end up in the mix for rookie of the year. In my opinion, he'll match or slightly exceed his draft position. It's all about expectations, but I'm not sure what you feel is so terrible...

They COULD and should be a pass-first offense. Their defense is pretty bad, so they COULD end up playing from behind quite a bit, and forced to abandon the run (Which is really my only concern).

In hospitals, you get the luxury to be able get extra help. But in nursing homes, there is usually just one person assigned to moving a patient and that person is usually a scrawny young girl, not the experience burly women. Just doing basic stuff like getting a patient in and out of bed makes it a living hell for all involved.

But that's not even the biggest issue. Some forms of diagnostic equipment are impossible to use on obese people. Want to do an echo/ultrasound on an obese patient? Almost impossible to reach the organs with your equipment. You can't even test for galbladder irritation.

Want to do an EKG (ElectroKardioGram) to check for heart-problems? You can't because the heart is insulated by such a thick layer of fat that you only get microvoltages as readouts. No use to anyone and very dangerous if a patient is sent in for a heart attack. 

Some patients for example don't fit inside an MRI. So believe it or not, some morbidly obese patients are sent to special clinics which has special MRI's designed to fit horses. Those MRI's are normally used to check-up on horses used in horse races and for the horse industry in general. But as you understand, it takes time and proper scheduling to make use of such a specialized MRI. This can in turn result in diagnostic delay.

Any kind of surgery just takes longer because you have to get through layers and layers of fat. When you need to close up, you have to sew these layers back together again, taking much time as well. Surgeons lose much of their sensation of touch when there is much fat involved.

Want to do keyhole surgery? Almost impossible to even maneuvre the camera. I once had a laporascopic uterus removal cancelled mid-surgery because the patient was too obese to identify the structures involved. 

This is some real shit doctors have to deal with and we have to go through hoops, improvise and deliver subpar medicine to those that are (morbidly) obese.

"It's one of those ceteris paribus situations and depends on who you identify as ""rich"" or ""poor"" what happens to wages and interest rates.

* If wages fail to rise then existing workers may lose from this with their pay falling in real terms (while new workers resulting from the increased expenditure could gain)
* If interest rates fail to rise then existing holders of money may lose with the value their assets falling in real terms (while existing borrowers may gain as they have to repay less in real terms)

I really doubt the EFF would speak so positively about something that's compromised in such a way.

_______

Detail from the EFF statement:

&gt; The ban on certain kinds of zero rating‚Äîthe kinds that lead consumers to services that ISPs want them to use rather than giving them choices‚Äîalso remains.

Which links to https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/californias-net-neutrality-bill-has-strong-zero-rating-protections-low-income

&gt; S.B. 822 bans the practice of self-dealing and discriminatory gatekeeping by ISPs outright, which is why those same ISPs will fight to take it out of the legislation before it becomes law. It is why they are actively attempting to mislead legislators in Sacramento with bogus superficial studies from groups that represent ISP interests like CALinnovates that ignore the fact that the data cap is an artificial construct that is designed to raise rates on wireless users and zero rating is how they exploit that structure. There is no benefit to Internet users by simply saying the ISP‚Äôs selected services do not have additional fees associated with them and nothing about the current structure is ‚Äúfree‚Äù because we have all compensated companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon to the tune of $26 billion in profits in just 2016 alone.

&gt; Without the ability to profit from discriminatory conduct, the wireless carriers will lose the financial incentive to use zero rating to create an inferior wireless Internet for those with limited income and will no longer be able to exploit their gatekeeper power.

So it sounds like the EFF is mostly concerned with zero-rating for mobile data.

The second link: http://sd11.senate.ca.gov/sites/sd11.senate.ca.gov/files/sb822_wclp_letter_on_zero_5-23.pdf

&gt; Discriminatory Zero-Rating
&gt; Zero-rating means that certain content is exempt from a user‚Äôs data cap. **It is important to
note that SB 822 does not prohibit all forms of zero-rating. SB 822 specifically allows zerorating
that benefits consumers, such as allowing for exempt data within a certain time period
(such as at night) so a user can backup their data**. It would also exempt charging for any app
of a certain type (such as all map/GPS applications). **The bill bars discriminatory zero-rating
that allows an ISP to pick between websites or applications of the same type, giving
preference to those co-owned with the ISP or that pay the ISP a fee.**

Basically, **there is no blanket ban on zero-rating, but it is restricted**.  The intent is to permit things like zero-rating low-network-demand times, so you can upload/download backups or other intensive network activities.

Without going into the specifics of reading the bill (and knowing all the contextual information about this issue, terms of art, etc.), I don't think the parent comment is accurate.  This bill does have protections for predatory zero-rating, but makes exceptions for reasonable use.  Whether this would still permit predatory activities is a reasonable concern, but I'd like to see the argument made in detail."

1658	"Hello, I am a non-Christian married to a Catholic so I think I can offer more direct experience that might hopefully be useful for you.

&gt;  But, how will my opinions of these things change if marriage is actually on the table? 

This is something I think you need to give serious personal thought on. What do you expect from a potential marriage in terms of your role, her role, and the church's role in your lives. What are you willing to participate in and what are you not okay with? It's easy to be very chill about religion when it's just a boyfriend/girlfriend thing but attitudes can change when it comes to how to live out one's life and raise a family. That's something you need to talk to her about and see what her expectations for you, herself, and the future will be and how the children will be raised and how the house will be run. 

&gt; but what happens when things get more serious?  

Because you were raised Catholic, the Church will treat you as Catholic despite what you claim to be now which isn't necessarily a bad thing because if you were a non-Christian, you might have had to get a dispensation from the Bishop to have permission to get married. So it'll make things easier.

The Church isn't as super discouraging as it used to be with interfaith marriages. What they expect is mostly that you will affirm that you will not interfere with her ability to practice her faith, and that you will not interfere with the children being raised Catholic. If the priest in charge of the process does not trust you to keep your word, you can be denied marriage. But again, you are technically Catholic so unless you say something incredibly stupid you should be fine. It's not like they have anyone following up to see how Catholic you are.

You will be expected to attend premarital counseling either in the form of sessions or a weekend long retreat where you will have intensive talks about relationships, communication, conflict-management and then lots of intimate one-on-one talks with your partner about all aspects of your relationship going forward. 

The wedding MUST be in a Catholic Church and typically it's her own parish. The Bishop has to approve getting married anywhere else but since you're both considered Catholic it's extremely unlikely you have a justifiable reason to be married outside of a Catholic Church. You can get married in other parishes, but it requires lots of paperwork and getting married in a parish that is not your own comes with a hefty premium cost, especially if the parish is historic and/or aesthetically unique. 

&gt; Is it possible she might try to convert me then, even though she told me she never would? 

You need to talk to her about this and work out an understanding of expectations, if you are afraid she will turn on you that's a huge point of concern that needs to be ironed out. But it's things like this that are exactly why premarital counseling exists, to help you sort things out for a successful future (or to identify why it wont work). 

&gt; Any couples that have had the same experience? How did things turn out in the long run? 

My wife and I have been happily married for almost five years. At the very beginning of the relationship we did a whole lot of discussion on our religious backgrounds because we both knew it was a potential issue. Even if we didn't agree on things like the nature of the universe, we did seek to find if we shared similar values, morals, and ethics and similar attitudes on how a marriage should work, and how our family would be raised. It's something that every couple should be doing no matter the religion but people sometimes overlook it and just assume that both people being ""Christian"" have similar attitudes and values. But by building a relationship on blocks by blocks of shared understanding instead of assumptions you can create an stable resilient relationship with mutual trust and respect.

&amp;#x200B;"	"That‚Äôs totally fair. Dating a single parents means that you have to understand that the child‚Äôs needs come first. If their parents don‚Äôt put their needs (not wants) first, they‚Äôre likely a shit parent and that selfish behaviour will appear in other parts of their life. 

If you don‚Äôt want to take a child (you had no part in creating) into consideration when you make plans (vacation, where to live, how to spend your time and money), that is just being honest.

18 is so young! Consider what it means to stay. As the kid gets older, will there be shared custody and holidays with the grandparents? Will he have custody of the child part time? What will that mean if you two live together? What if the mom is unable to care for the child (death or unfit parent) and full custody goes to your bf? Are you ready to be a stepparent?

Pack it in, no one gives a shit."	"Aside from the extinct species of camel native to North America, in 1862 Europeans started to import camels to British Columbia during the colonization of the region and the explosive time in history that was the gold rush. Bactrian camels helped in hauling heavy materials up the mountainous and rugged terrain of British Columbia. They could comfortably survive freezing winters and boiling summers, and were able to travel long distances without drinking or grazing.

B.C. stopped importing them fairly quickly though because of various issues. First of all, horses, which were much more widely used by Europeans, were terrified of camels and would flee in terror at the sight of them. Camels also had a bad tendency to eat the cargo they were supposed to carry, including clothes and soap (vital to smelly miners). Camel feet were quite soft as well, and they needed special boots to walk the rocky terrain. The final straw was when all of camelkind managed to piss of a very prominent politician in the Crown Colony of British Columbia at the time. Chief Justice Mathew Bailie Begbie had a traumatic experience as his camel went rogue and darted into the wilderness with Sir Begbie hanging on for dear life. He would despise camels until the day he died, and he played a major part in stopping camel imports to British Columbia. (Begbie was just sort of a douchebag in general, and has earned the posthumous title of ""the Hanging Judge."" That is another story, though.)

Domesticated camels in B.C. would be abandoned, killed, or left to chill on pastures. They ceased to be used as labour animals only a few years after being imported. Some camels escaped to the wilds where they would survive as freecamels. These wild camels, dubbed ""Cariboo Camels,"" were spotted until the early 1900s.

[Just for fun, here is the only known picture of a Cariboo Camel.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Cariboo_camel.gif)

I prefer physical books to digital and as you might expect I've collected a few hardback books that come with the covers around them.  I also prefer to house the books naked without the covers.  My question is for people with my sensibilities: what do you do with all the loose book covers you end up with?  Throw them away?  Keep them in a special box?

They're fun, and for what they were - they were ahead of their time when they were new cars, but technology has quickly outpaced the advances of the era. I don't think they're bad cars by any means, but when you have the opportunity to drive an STi/Evo X or 90s GT-R, you're going to get objectively better handling, control, amenities from the newer cars.

Misconceptions that people have about them:

1. They're fast - not really, at least stock. No faster than a WRX or base model Mustang.
2. They're cheap/easy to maintain - nope. Expensive and hard to source parts makes them quite expensive. Not luxury car expensive, but I've probably dumped over 2k in mine and I've had it just over a year for basic maintenance.
3. They're rare - pointed out in the article, not really. They're unique/uncommon in the US, that's about it.
4. Easy to mod - subjective. I'm an enthusiast, not a shop mechanic. I look at value added upgrades and pricing starts shooting sky high. Good turbos for a twin setup are about 2-3k new, a single turbo swap actually would cost me more because everything would have to be rebuilt/custom and then a new turbo.

These are great cars for people who want to relish or embellish the experience of owning a Japanese legend, and for those who are capable of either a) affording someone to work on the car, or b) able to perform the work yourself. Other than that, there's much more capable, newer cars available today.

The one very key and important part of the Skyline GT-R is that they've already hit the end of their depreciation curve/cycle. The prices seem relatively stable, but you'll notice gradual price increases over the past several years and I think the hope is that once the hype dies out - anyone who owns and maintains one for any decent length of time will come out ""ahead""."	Yep, the agility of that car definitely lead me to be much more comfortable  throwing it around.

He created the entire universe, and all of our very lives, and has the power to destroy all things, but sustains and nurtures existence anyway. This is just a sample of the many qualities that God surpasses us in, and He is deserving of worship because of them. 	"The abrahamic religions seem to surface around a few notions present in the divinity defined by the first abrahamic documents. From a historical perspective it is expected that one who follows a newer version tries to broaden one's knowledge through this exercise of getting to know the first phenomena that gave birth to all the principles. It is also not very surprising if the idea that the first is the original faith and therefore carries all the foundation needed to help one's knowledge. I also would recommend to not only ask ""why"" but also ""how"", giving that the pursuit of religious education is individual and each person has a very specific path."

1706	"If the kid is American, he would be super popular in certain circles, could even milk it

I AM SON OF HITLER! BOW TO ME!"	"well keep in mind, the Rich and powerful don't necessarily need University accreditation to participate in high level leadership and accomplishing their goals..

Examples:

* The Queen of England was tutored most of her life
* Prince Harry holds no Degree but Received Officer Training
* Prince Williams was the first Royal to Enroll at Eton 
* In Fact Prince Charles  in 1970's started it:

&gt;Prince Charles entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1967, where he read history, archaeology and anthropology and graduated with a 2:2 degree in 1970. This was the first time in history that a British monarch or heir to the throne had completed a university degree.

When your life has been planned out for you, and your future secured, you will be trained to take on those roles by those doing the planning. You are groomed for the role from day one. I'm not trying to make this a entitled nepotism argument bemoaning the unfair nature of the rich and famous. It's just the way it is, these kids have a different trajectory than others and to not get trained to capitalize upon that is a waste of their potential. 

And in no way do I mean to diminish the Royal family for not having a traditional modern formal education. In fact people are learning that reliance on university and college education is not a requirement to be successful. If anything the importance of holding such accreditation has been over embellished  in the last 40 years. 

In the article they mentioned that two students raised over a 100,000  for a hospital they had visited as part of humanitarian efforts. It's great, but honestly how successful would your everyday person be to raise such money for a cause. It's like saying I will be a youtube celebrity tomorrow by copying what another YouTuber does. These students have connections with deep pockets, to make that kind of donation feasible. It doesn't diminish what they did, or why they did it, but they are not playing under the same rules as everyone else, and have different resources to capitalize on to make them successful. If you or I tried to Raise money for a similar cause, will we get close to a 1000 dollars in donations? 10000 even? 

All I'm saying is that University is a time sink and goal for people who need it, or want it. 

The Rich and powerful don't necessarily need to invest that time in that are and some for security concerns may never want to expose their family to the public that way. Who wants to have the media lampoon your son or daughter for not ranking valedictorian, or a drop out even. We already make fun of people with art degrees as waste of time for people who are going to be working fastfood. Participation in public systems open you up for the same public judgement.

In my professional opinion I would want the diamond to be pictured by the miner and with the miner. Then his family and employer all verify he is not a slave and is paid appropriately for the diamond. Then the transportation is logged by RFID and employees. The jeweler is logged for splitting/ cutting the diamond. Who the jeweler sells them to is logged. Who buys the diamond is logged and the miner could even see the lucky gal or rapper the diamond ended up on. 

It would have to be completely transparent. I would be able to call up and ask any of the people on the diamonds life and verify. And also I would include an incentive for journalists, miners, employers, and activists to prove that all the diamonds on the blockchain are in fact slave labor free. The incentive is the most important part because it will keep those who want to lie under check, especially with the punishment that once they are caught they would get kicked off the blockchain and potentially have to pay all of those involved.

Why on earth would I fill up the flair with apple products in a Android thread? Also I'm actually out of room to add anything! 

For your info I have a iPad mini 2 LTE, mini 4 128gb, ipad pro 10.5 with pencil, iPhone 7, 8 plus and  macbook pro 2016 non touch bar. I'm eagerly waiting on new mini to drop and will buy it in a heart beat. 

So yeah.. You don't think Ive never  used Apple products? My first was in grade 3 back in 1988 with a IIe, had a power book 140  and thought that was the shit. Hell , I've even had a newton 100 and 120 before Jobs came back and killed it, Ipods I've had plenty of also. Even gave a tangerine imac g3 a go then upgraded to a G4 Cube while lusting over a Quad SMP G5 power Mac. 

 Im not exactly honest eh? If anything I should be a Apple Fanboi but I'm simply not as they now screw consumers over with planned obsolescence, snotty with the user base and also merged the MacOS team into ios team as that's where they make 75% of their money now. I hate the X because there's no damn home button/finger print scanner and the notch shits me (ever tried watching videos in landscape?) not to mention I'm Asian so the face I. D don't work well at all! Notice there's not a single notch devices in my flair?

P. S I'm also both the beta program for ios and MacOS.

So you see I've had quite a bit of Apple experience ,, that and the usual DOS with Amiga to os/2 to all upto current windows with splash of Windows CE,, symbian and PalmOS.

I would give some of these goons that they call geniuses  at the Apple store a good going but I get paid way too much in my field  to bother working there or waste my time at the apple store. All they do now is just replace machines and not do any actual repair work as it all gets shipped to China to be repaired.

There is clear, unequivocal evidence that on average, work is generally good for a person's physical and mental health, providing structure, social contacts, physical and mental activity, social status, a sense of identity and financial resources. People who are unemployed tend to have poorer physical and mental health overall, consult their GP more, are more likely to be admitted to hospital and more likely to have higher death rates. Long term unemployment makes this even worse, with much higher levels of depression and anxiety. 

Returning to work, if you are able, significantly benefits mental ill-health, helps recovery and is the best way to prevent long term sickness. It has measurable health benefits, particularly for people with mild or severe mental health problems. 

From that perspective, an immediate, forceful push to get people back to work as soon as possible rather than on benefits in the face of unemployment is in the interests of the individuals in question, and a harsher benefits system a mechanism to achieve that. 

There are plenty of legitimate and reasonable criticisms to be made of this position, most obviously that this unfairly hurts people who are not able to work, and that many jobs are detrimental rather than helpful to people's mental and physical health, but I feel this is a better starting off point than where we were in 2010, where lots of unemployed people who were otherwise healthy were encouraged to register as disabled to fudge the numbers irrespective of the impact on their health."

Honestly, I have not had sex for about 5 1/2 years, but I have had my share of slutty times . . . I am not saying that the people whom I shared intercourse with were bad people; some of them were quite nice, but I will say that I do have some remorse when I think that if I ever have a true, meaningful, and deep relationship, I will be giving my partner a used vessel - you wouldn‚Äôt want someone taking a bite of your sand which before handing it to you to eat at the deli, I‚Äôm sure . . .

Our rent/mortgage halved, local tax burden halved, cost of living was a quarter of what it was in the bay area. Quality of life went up exponentially. We now live in a house that is 3x the size of any place we rented in California, a few times in the past 6 years we have had outs cash reserves climb high enough to could have posted of most of the mortgage. Our savings rate in California was only around $1,000 a month. We worked such ridiculous hours and commuting that cooking at home was just not feasibly. Things became even worse when our first child was born. We got lucky and found a daycare that wouldn't bankrupt us. 
  
The sad fact of the bay area is cost of living far outpaces the pay for the vast majority of the skilled worker. Home ownership is only available to those in senior leadership positions. To have what we have now in the bay area our income would have to be in the 750k range. We could probably only make half that at current offerings.

1791	"Sorry, I stand corrected on one point: an additional gene causes the delay that makes calicos less red/black. From Wikipedia:

&gt;Pigment genes are expressed in melanocytes that migrate to the skin surface later in development. In bi-colored tortoiseshell cats, the melanocytes arrive relatively early, and the two cell types become intermingled, producing the characteristic brindled appearance consisting of an intimate mixture of orange and black cells, with occasional small diffuse spots of orange and black.

&gt;In tri-colored calico cats, a separate gene interacts developmentally with the coat color gene. This spotting gene produces white, unpigmented patches by delaying the migration of the melanocytes to the skin surface. There are a number of alleles of this gene that produce greater or lesser delays. The amount of white is artificially divided into mitted, bicolor, harlequin, and van, going from almost no white to almost completely white. In the extreme case, no melanocytes make it to the skin and the cat is entirely white (but not an albino). In intermediate cases, melanocyte migration is slowed, so that the pigment cells arrive late in development and have less time to intermingle. Observation of tri-color cats will show that, with a little white color, the orange and black patches become more defined, and with still more white, the patches become completely distinct. Each patch represents a clone of cells derived from one original cell in the early embryo."	"We actually had this.

1802	"My back feels amazing, thank god. Definitely wanna say that I'm not officially certified by any organization and all my research can be labelled ""opinion"" based. But I got an MRI and had a slight bulge in two discs, luckily it was minor enough that I had no impingement on the sciatic nerve. The docs (obviously) recommended taking 6-8 weeks off of training to let it rest, but what do they know about the gains right??

My personal approach was a lot of stretching, I will say that before the injury I had trouble touching the floor on a hamstring stretch, I slacked in that department. I went to physical therapy for 4 weeks where they gave me some heat and then a band and had me stretch for 40 minutes. So I stopped going back and carried on with stretching on my own, doing more static holds on lower back extensions as they still felt comfortable (no pain) and I found more exercises that gave my posterior chain a break. (My main leg day exercise because heavy lunges as i felt more comfortable bailing the weight if i were to ever feel pain).

I've read somewhere before about how the SI joint can hold an extreme amount of distributive force from even a small actual weight. I would love for someone who has more knowledge to intervene, but I've read that when doing a squat with a weight around 60lbs, your SI joint can feel a force equivalent to somewhere around 1600 pounds. That's a hell of a lot to play around with on your back. I just play it safe because I always had a crappy squat form and didn't feel the need to really fix it when I had other routes i could take.

1863	"&gt; How do you figure the volume of the plastic going by the weight alone?

I'm not sure if this is a serious question, and if so, I'm not trying to talk down to you. But, this is a very basic question you've asked and I'm not sure how to answer it other than to be very simple about it. 

So here goes.

The answer to your question is that basically all materials have a known ""density"" that you can just look up. Water has one, copper has one, iron has another, packed and unpacked brown sugar have ones, etc. An easy way to measure this is to put a piece of something in water and see how much water it displaces.

Density is just the ratio of a substance's mass and the amount of space it takes up. Heavier things will have more mass in the same volume.

If you know the mass (given in the article as 80,000 tons) and you know the density (a number you can just look up, or measure yourself), you can find out the volume it would take up.

Volume = Mass / Density

In this case, some plastics are slightly above, some slightly below the density of water, (within 5-10%) so I just averaged them out to be the same density as water, which was good enough for a ballpark approximation.

Once I had that number sort of visualized, I picked the first thing that came to mind about the same scale, which was an apartment building, and then that was too variable so the next thing I thought of was a Walmart, which I looked up the average square footage of.

Ta da.

&gt; And you are aware of the depletion of global fish stocks caused by overfishing and pollution, right? It's not just one thing.

Pair it with an APSC body that has fast and accurate AF for best results (80D or 7D/7D mkii). If you look around long enough you can get one for $500 or less. Sigma and tamron have also released 100-400 lenses that weigh 2.5 to 3lbs as well which could be good choices. However, since they are new you will be paying full price for them. The AF won't be as fast as the 400 5.6 prime, but they have more flexibility than the prime so you'll have to chose the best option for you.

If you want reach, the canon 100-400 mkii takes a 1.4x tc way better than the 400 5.6. This will get you out to 560mm (896mm FF equivalent) for 1lb less than the 150-600. Your body will need to be an 80D or one of the 7Ds so you can autofocus at f8 with the tc on

If you have a ton of money burning a hole in your pocket there is the 400mm f4 DO IS mkii which takes the 1.4x and 2x tc's well, getting you out to 800mm at f8. With a crop camera, that is 1280mm FF equivalent. The lens weighs just a hair more than the 150-600, but it gets you to 800mm in a hand-holdable package.

You're just saying words here. Okay, so it's been above a number you picked that it's at now. That number is also 20% lower than that exact same metric at the exact same time of the year 2 years earlier. 20% is a very noticeable decline. Just because it's stayed above an arbitrary number (700k peak) doesn't change a thing.

&gt; What mental gymnastics, you're the one jumping through crazy hoops to imply the game is dying, which is what people like you have been claiming for a decade now in this game and TF2 and Counterstrike and only 1 of them has actually had anything close to a ""death"".

Um... I think you're a little bit crazy about this, to be honest. I didn't say the game is dying once. I said the player base is decreasing. I also backed that up by providing numbers directly from a source that was arguing the opposite. There's absolutely no mental gymnastics there.

&gt; So following the same yearly rises and falls is decreasing? You compared June and December of 2017 and May of 2018. All of which match up with major life events such as Finals.

I compared June of this year and June of last year. Literally the exact same month, from year to year, it decreased by 15%. Honestly, what more could you ask for than that? I also chose shorter intervals just for more evidence but again, if you consider that those have to do with yearly trends, you can absolutely ignore them and still look at June to June.

&gt; And what's weird is you choose average players rather than peak

What on earth? You're just desperately trying everything here, honestly. I chose average because I thought that was more representative of the number of people regularly playing the game. The source we're using also thinks the same, that's why they list that number first and only provide gains/losses based on that number. To assume I'd use anything but the primary number provided by the source would be silly. But I certainly can:

June 2018 796,886 | June 2017 923,122 - 14% decrease.

And again, that's using the numbers you apparently would prefer I used. That's going from the same month to month across one year, so there's nothing like finals or anything like that to skew it. The decrease is almost the same.

&gt; All player bases are constantly shrinking after they hit their peak. You can safely claim that bullshit claim whenever you want for literally any game and then point to the awful metric you pointed to.

Again, so the game is shrinking. That's what I claimed. That's all I claimed.

Again, your response seems a bit unhinged when you say stuff like

&gt; All player bases are constantly shrinking after they hit their peak.

with 

&gt; it's not at all decreasing like you claim.

You do realize that shrinking and decrease are the same thing, right? So in once sentence you admit that it is shrinking and in the next you say it's not at all?

Edit: And just to clarify one last time, in case there's any confusion. I never said the game is dying. I said the OP was right when he said the player base is shrinking. In the last year, the player base has significantly decreased. That's the very definition of shrinking. If from year to year, a number consistently goes down, that's decreasing. From last year to this year, the game's player base has empirically decreased, and while I can't say whether that will have happened again in another year, I can say that for now that means exactly what I said.

1894	"devil's advocate (eg, I'm so, so not a brexiteer) - a deal the EU makes doesn't have to be the best deal for the UK.  A deal that could be ""not as good"" in the EU's eyes, could be more tailored to the UK's strengths.

This deal with Japan is a good example.  One of the lines that do really well under it, are hard cheeses.  That's something that plays to the UK (&amp; Ireland!) really well.  That particular line doesn't benefit other countries as much.  It's a great example of a line that the UK would call a win, but at least 50% of EU countries are going to meh over.

If France made this deal, they'd be wondering if they really have to start making cheddar.  If the UK made this deal, they'd be high-fiving dairy farmers.  Not every deal that's in the EU's best interests is in the UK's best interests, and not every deal in the UK's best interests is in the EU's best interests.

(I still fundamentally believe it's a net win for the EU in aggregate.  But arguments could be made on a case-by-case basis.  If the UK wins every such case-by-case, it could come out on top.  After successive governments that couldn't organise a piss-up in a brewery, I've come to believe that's a very big ""if"".  Not impossible, only improbable.)"	My view is that this would be used from the exact opposite scenario.  The MI5 operative infiltrates a terrorist or spy group.

"The attack doesn't actually cause a fault to the OS.

The read to kernel memory is executed speculatively under a condition that is false (e.g. an if() block which the branch predictor has been trained to believe will be taken, but won't this time).  Before that branch can be resolved (this can be delayed, for instance by making it dependent on data which is not in the cache), the ""invalid"" read and the subsequent dependent read are executed speculatively.  Eventually the branch gets resolved and the speculative execution (including the fault) is unwound, but the effect of that second dependent read on the cache can be detected afterwards.

This is why the attack works - on the invalid read the processor notes that the permissions are wrong and it should be faulted, but as it's speculative it cannot deliver the fault until the speculation is resolved.  The speculation is allowed to continue and speculatively execute the second read because it would require more complex hardware to stop it, and (prior to this attack) it was thought to be harmless."	programming	programming	-1

Business degrees are fucking worthless. You want to learn business...**then do business**.

Don't know how to do business without learning from some halfass businessmen/academics in a classroom for $50k a year? **You most likely aren't going to be a very good businessman if this is the case.**

The money most people spend on a business degree would have been WAY better spent with trial and error. 4 (or 5) years and 6 figures in capital not spent on some halfassed education and instead utilized in the actual business world?

WAY more than what you ever learned achieving some business degree...and you could have succeeded and have a viable, successful business in those 4 years. Even if you failed, the experience is leaps and bounds more valuable than taking fucking exams.

We have the internet now. You can learn anything you want. **Who in the fuck thinks paying for some formal education is worth it anymore?**

I'll tell you who: Sheep that think it matters. Like it or not, a college degree gives you status in this shallow world. This is directly to the benefit to these universities that continually price gouge students for insane fees.

Do you people not see this? Are the social brownie points worth *that* much to you?

College was a good thing years ago. It was a point in time where people get away from home and their parents and did something new. You learned some stuff, but more than that...you developed who you were. The experience was relatively inexpensive....and the average student could have paid their full tuition with a summer job.

It made sense then.

But at $30k+ a year in debt, potentially 6 figures upon graduation, you have to ask yourself, ""Am I getting good use from this time and money?""

In the majority of cases, I would say absolutely not.

1917	Ok, let's say for the sake of argument that's correct. There still wouldn't be as much incest since that human would be breeding with non-humans that are genetically the same species.	"Well, I suppose it was this paragraph:

&gt; Not all slavery was the mass selling of innocent civilians for profit and the sake of industrialization like ours was. I know history can be tough for you to look at because of how much you hate context but if you look back to the time period, civilizations had disputes back then and occasionally out of either the need from a new home from being driven from the old one, or self defense, or even militarism in some nations histories, sometimes they would take each other over and their people as a consequence. Now you had to make a decision what to do with those people, we call them refugees and they called them slaves. They were a lower class sure, just like most shitty people see refugees as a lower class than nationalized aristocrats or upper class citizens. The people they didn‚Äôt kill and chose to re-integrate in their society would have been called slaves. They gave them homes and food and jobs and they lived in much better conditions with much better treatment than our version of slaves for instance. I also don‚Äôt see how serfdom isn‚Äôt slavery, and it‚Äôs a fine line between controlling the lower class and prison economy or outsourcing our labor to labor camps and sweat shops oversees than if we had a well treated slave economy. It‚Äôs just a term or word, it‚Äôs the application in society that mattered. There were plenty of ways you could biblically mistreat your servant or slave and there were also ways you could treat a conquered person with dignity and respect. Owning a slave throughout history did not require roots type behavior. 

Now this was my question: what is the context the makes slavery as condoned and approved by THE BIBLE not immoral? 

I shall try to make sense out of your attempt to answer that question:

&gt; civilizations had disputes back then and occasionally out of either the need from a new home from being driven from the old one, or self defense, or even militarism in some nations histories, sometimes they would take each other over and their people as a consequence. 

We are talking here about SLAVERY in the bible.

&gt; Not all slavery was the mass selling of innocent civilians for profit and the sake of industrialization like ours was. 

Irrelevant. When slavery wasn't mass selling for any purpose, it *is still* slavery.

&gt; Now you had to make a decision what to do with those people, we call them refugees and they called them slaves. 

Are you talking about the bible when referring to ""refugees""????? In the bible we have SLAVES and SLAVERY. NOT ""refugees"".

&gt; They were a lower class sure, just like most shitty people see refugees as a lower class than nationalized aristocrats or upper class citizens.

We are talking here about SLAVERY in the bible, not about lower classes.

&gt; The people they didn‚Äôt kill and chose to re-integrate in their society would have been called slaves. 

And that's SLAVERY. And it's condoned and approved by god.

&gt; They gave them homes and food and jobs and they lived in much better conditions with much better treatment than our version of slaves for instance.

How do you know in the first place????? The *only* thing the bible tells you that you may beat them almost to death. We also have direct evidence that females were held as sexual slaves which also defines successive rape. Jewish fathers were allowed to sell their daughters (""of course* *not* their sons, the denigration of women in the bible is *disgusting*) as slave. Now what would happen to such a girl. For the rest this is fantasy.

Anyway, even granting this point for the sake of argument, this fails to answer the simple question: is owning another human ever moral, or not? The relative kindness of a slave owner does not enter into the basic moral question of owning other humans as property. Natascha Maria Kampusch is an Austrian woman who was abducted at the age of 10 on 2 March 1998 and held in a secret cellar by her kidnapper Wolfgang P≈ôiklopil for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. She was treated extremely well but was basically a slave for P≈ôiklopil. P≈ôiklopil, knowing that the police were after him, killed himself by jumping in front of a suburban train near the Wien Nord station in Vienna. When he wouldn't have done that, he probably would have been sentenced for decades in prison.

&gt; I also don‚Äôt see how serfdom isn‚Äôt slavery

We don't talk about serfdom but about SLAVERY in the bible.

Until now only lame attempts to redefine slavery into ""serfdom"" or the like. Which is plain deceit. The bible talks about SLAVERY. Then we have the unsubstantiated argument that slaves were treated not as bad as in more modern times which does not even provide any context for slavery. And that's about it. No context."

1918	"Of course honey. I‚Äôm not a trained sex counselor but I did a brief stint in my university peer health education group and I‚Äôve studied sex and sexuality, and I‚Äôm an anonymous person on the internet you can message without judgement. I‚Äôve also had my own sexual shortcomings with myself and my partner so I can speak clinically and from experience.

I strongly advise against bringing in another person at this time, but you already know that. When you add another person you have to have a strong relationship without any cracks because that other will expand those cracks. 

As for masturbating, I do suggest a vibrator mainly because I love Mine. You can get a simple stick one that can be used internally or for clitoral stimulation from any sex shop for &gt; $20 or my current favorite is a clitoral stimulator called the Satisfyer. It‚Äôs $60 and a knock off of the cult favorite Womanizer. It‚Äôs also a good option to use with a partner because it‚Äôs not phalic shaped so it doesn‚Äôt present competition subconsciously for your partner. You may also want to look into buying a dildo for simultaneous clitoral stimulation and insertion. My best tip for masturbating though is to keep doing it!

Not having even ounce of assertiveness doesn't help since you are engaging in stuff that isn't your style. Do you at least have some pleasure in pleasing a partner when you really see he loves it and appreciates your work? That's often reason why girls like giving blowjobs. Getting stabbed in the mouth with dick isn't the most comfortable thing in the world after all.

Since you watch porn, how about experimenting if you'll stay aroused and not have regrets while watching really vanilla, PIV sex with lot of affection. Lot of kissing and passion.

"This is a great example of anecdotal evidence over actual real scientific evidence, and I heavily caution anyone reading this to think critically and do research before following this advice.

Ages 6 to 9 are the perfect age window to broach the subject of Sex, as children have a maximum of curiosity and a minimum of embarrassment about their lack of understanding.

This is a widely accepted fact amongst most child psychologists and is very easy to find information about online.

However, the most important reason for him to be honest goes much deeper than that. Sex is a subject that most people avoid like the plague with their children, and that makes children learn to avoid talking about it with their parents. This is a chance for him to be vulnerable, open, honest, and informative with his daughter. This is his chance to establish himself not only as a resource but also someone who will always be there for advice and for help. 

People who can‚Äôt even properly distinguish which They‚Äôre/their/there to use at the start of their sentences probably should refrain from giving advice about SERIOUS situations that could have SERIOUS repercussions for a father/daughter relationship forever. 

‚ÄúThey think love is what a family shares, not sexual partners.‚Äù Right, let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs true, then that‚Äôs the entire point of having a conversation with the child. You can help them learn what Love is; why it‚Äôs so essential prior to Sex, and answer any immediate questions they might have, establishing yourself as a resource on the topic, as open to discuss it, and as a genuine and honest parent.

When you say that you shouldn‚Äôt teach someone about a subject because they don‚Äôt know the subject yet, it‚Äôs a complete oxymoron. Knowledge doesn‚Äôt just appear out of nowhere at a set age. It‚Äôs not like his daughter will wake up at age 9 and suddenly understand what love between sexual partners is. The entire point of this thread is that his daughter doesn‚Äôt exactly understand and he needs to help her get there. Your advice can‚Äôt be, oh she doesn‚Äôt know A so don‚Äôt explain A until she knows A.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

I get it. This is the internet and you‚Äôre anonymous and so this doesn‚Äôt feel real. But I want you to know that following your advice would have had a substantial negative impact comparatively with following expert advice and widely accepted professional and medical opinions about the topic. You could have had an actual, substantial negative effect on a real father and a real daughter and their relationship. It‚Äôs not funny to try and bore her out of learning, and it‚Äôs not funny to make up fictional age barriers of the understanding of a topic.

1958	"That‚Äôs not an urban myth.

For ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù code, reducing instruction cache pressure is going to result in better performance.

For specific cases, say an audio/video encoder, it may be faster to have the additional inlining and loop unrolling. Or it might not. You have to benchmark your specific usage.

Modern processors do a really good job with branch prediction, so loop unrolling, for example, is a lot less effective than reducing instruction cache load.

Again, it depends entirely on the specific case, so, as a general rule, you don‚Äôt want widespread inlining and unrolling. 

EDIT: usually if you want to enable unrolling or something for a block of code, you can just use a pragma or whatever for your compiler for specific sections of code or place that code in a separate build module. But wholesale enabling of all optimization‚Äôs across the entire codebase is usually a bad idea."

Get good, scientific information from people who have spent years gathering high quality data. What type of drugs, surgery, or other treatments are most effective at keeping patients alive? What is the best evidence-based practice for that health problem?

If you want to know how to improve a public safety/public health crisis, I'd suggest talking to the people who have spent their lives training to study that problem. Look at the work of people who use the scientific method to gather and analyze data, and study related problems in depth for years. What evidence exists that one type of policy or another can help prevent deaths and injuries? What evidence do we have for or against various proposed policy changes? 

Researchers create the knowledge that drives how people are trained to do jobs like mine. Same goes for people in other fields."	I think this repeated point is way off the mark.

1968	"As an ex-Christian, the best way I can describe the whole ""talking to God"" thing (if it's not actually schizophrenia or hallucinations, which honestly it rarely is) is that it's more like hearing your own thoughts, like the voice in your head when you read. It doesn't quite sound like you but it's in your head.

Now I see it more like my subconscious mind or even parts of my conscious mind giving myself advice (""everything will be ok"" etc etc. I think everyone experiences this) but Christians would assign this voice to God because they're taught that humans are flawed and can't trust their own minds, or maybe they just want to think it's God.

In terms of how to deal with someone who thinks that it's God speaking and that's how they ""know,"" there's honestly no good solution. There's no way to really convince them without attempting to unravel their entire mindset around religion, which is very, very difficult to do.

It's usually best to just smile and nod or ask questions to clarify (what did you hear? Why do you think that? Etc.). I used to give the same excuse (I've met him!!) until I knew better, so I know that arguments and facts don't always work."	"Because they're *real* christians, who do exactly what their bible says- not like you modern namby-pamby christians, who water it down, rationalise and accept the Devil's medicine. Don't you realise these doctors think they're god themselves, with their lifesaving vaccinations and heart transplants?

Seriously, if you really believed what it said you'd have sold all your belongings, distributed the proceeds to the poor and gone on the road preaching long ago- because that's what your Lord tells you to do.

The problem actually lies with thinking that the bible is a source of truth from god. There's zero proof of that, but you'll continue to believe it does because the thought that perhaps it isn't is too much for you right now. Instead, you'll go on swallowing its lies, half-truths and inconsistencies if you're even aware of them, or go in in blissful privileged ignorance if you're not.

I'll just leave you with these two points for your consideration:

1- The 2004 tsunami killed at least 225,000 people. It was caused by an underwater earthquake, that itself was caused by a 1200 km stretch of the Indian plate thrusting up by 20 metres due to movement of the tectonic plates- a process that has been going on since the early history of the planet. Earthquakes are an unavoidable consequence of how the earth is constructed. So, why didn't your holy book tell humans not to live anywhere near the Ring of Fire? Didn't your god care? If he is real, why did he make this planet such a death trap? I repeat, *this is how the surface of the planet works.*

2- If your god is real, why did he invent malaria, the biggest killer of our species? Why also invent the perfect delivery vector, the mosquito? What does he have against us?

Quit thinking of the US as a single nation, it is closer to the European Union than a singular country, it is a federal union of states. Each state has its own data.

When you compare the United States to the entire European Union, the rate is 3.0 per 100k in the EU and 5.35 in the USA. You have to compare the land size, number of deaths AND attempted murder.

And if you incur an extra expense somewhere  (car repair, hospital visit etc), you may be set back for years. The issue here is that the mefian income in my area is only about 50k, which means about half of the city is just barely msking it. In order to own property around here, you need to be making around 70 or 80k, which is doable for above median income folks that are married with 2 incomes. Now, the kicker? This metro is considered good COL compared to othet places. Also, remember that civil servant jobs usually have a lower salary and much better benefits.

There's complaints that X faction leader never does anything, or that Y faction leader is acting really stupid and not in line with who their character is. There's the problem of major characters doing arbitrary things just so the plot can progress (Anduin bringing only 4 people to confront Sylvannas and letting her monologue them to death)  There's the problem that the alliance had no idea why they were even in Uldir, and I suspect the Horde are going to have a similiar ""what the hell is any of this?"" when we get to a raid centered around the alliance storyline.

I have heard social workers state that women do not commit such offences. If they believe this they are hardly likely to identify the problem.

There are many good reasons to believe that John's Gospel can actually be dated before the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, as it's author is very familiar with the the city and correctly describes the Pool of Bethesda, which archaeology has since confirmed it's existence. (John 5)

But we can certainly date the deity of Christ sooner than the Gospel of John. That deity of Christ is mentioned in the early creeds and psalms of the church, like in Philippians 2 and Romans 10:9-13. They quoted verses from the Old Testament normally ascribed to Yahweh and ascribed them to Jesus (Joel 2:32, Romans 10:13 for example). Paul said the Gospel he preached was confirmed by the Gospel that James, John and Peter preached from the beginning (Galatians 2). James was Jesus' brother, and Peter denied Christ only to become one of his most boldest proclaimers. They did this based on their eyewitness to the resurrection (creed dated from 33-38 AD from 1 Cor 15:3-7, sermon summaries in Acts 2, 10, 13, etc) 

There's a lot more I can unpack here, but Jesus' worship came and belief in his deity came from the earliest days of the church, it wasn't something that evolved over time. And the belief came from his resurrection, and there are reasons to believe his statements in the Gospels even excluding John's Gospel as that Jesus saw himself as the unique Son of God who would judge the nations. He forgave sins and claimed authority over the Sabbath (Mark 2) and people's eternal destinies (Luke 12:8‚Äì9). 

So for the Muslim (I'm not asking the atheists or agnostics here, that's another debate), I want to know why Allah deceived Jesus's own followers into thinking he was crucified when he was not really crucified, and why he allowed his followers to be deceived into believing and proclaiming his resurrection and give their lives for it if it never happened. "	"&gt;No it's not, and saying that it is only shows how much you don't understand what islam is.

You're denying *fact* and telling me it's my ignorance that's the problem - that's rather Trumpian behaviour.  Understanding Islam is irrelevant to the *fact* that most of the growth in the numbers of people counted as Muslim is because of birthrate.  Indeed, the number of converts is *minuscule* in comparison to growth due to birthrate.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_religion#Islam

&gt;The only countries that have this law of apostacy are arab countries and arabs make up only 15% of all muslims so what about countries that don't have laws against apostasy ?

Wrong, as my link above showed.  Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei all have laws and legal systems punish apostate Muslims, as do regions in Nigeria and Somalia.  And none of them are Arab majority.

&gt;They may feel that way but it doesn't mean that they don't become ex-muslims

With this said, there has been a complete shift in morals, a whole new generation or two, and millions of other changes since that original referendum.

That said, it's disingenuous to say ""I don't know"" in domains that are both momentous and inevitable (to borrow William James). 

I don't *know* whether my wife is faithful, but I must choose to act as if she is or isn't. This is a momentous question, and I cannot live as if I don't know. To keep our relationship healthy, I must trust 100% even when I only have 99.99% confidence.

I don't know whether the human race will survive another generation, but I must act as if it will survive another million years (and so treat the environment a certain way, invest in education, etc.) I must act with 100% confidence that the human race will not be extinct soon, even though I only believe this with 10-15% confidence (after reading John Leslie's damned book, End of the World.)

You may not know if the miracles experienced by millions of people around the world, today and in the past, represent anything potentially interesting about the world... but you must act. 

More to the point, you may not know whether an all powerful being exists and has moral demands on you, but you must act one way or the other.

2090	"&gt; the supply curve for each school has flatter plateaus that can only be reached with capital expenditure (like a set of stairs)

But that wouldn't hold in aggregate; aggregate supply would be smooth, yes individually a school performing a large capital spend (say, constructing more classrooms and hiring faculty) is large and not smooth; but on a national scale you can't assume a non-smooth curve, as there are many school's individual curves aggregated together; and the different schools are all at different levels of capacity and have the ""steps"" of capital spend at different points. So what you're describing may hold for a single school's supply curve, but I wouldn't project that shape on the aggregate.

For your demand curve &amp; price discussion; the context here is tax ~~rebates~~ deductions; not student loans. I admit the two factors play different roles, but the case here is tax exemptions on education, not the larger student loan &amp; financing debate (where direct subsidies &amp; such come into play). Multiple mechanisms in play simultaneously; but let's not diverge from arguments that tax deductions can have market corrective influence with the fact that other policies can also have distortion effects... that's more than I'm willing to support, this is a case where education expenditures (not in the form of loans) can reduce income tax burdens.

"I'd expand on this to say that different car models will have different depreciation curves. 

Look for what car you want to buy and then look at how it loses value over time. It's usually 2-4 years.

2092	The other team won a 5v4, they should enjoy their 50-80% LP, whatever it is, and move on. It's the best outcome for a shitty game - mitigate the losses for the AFKers team, give the winning team a scaled down victory because they won a 100% free game. 	"I'm seeing a fair amount of posts over the last month on /r/leagueoflegends outlining how they feel League is being purposely shifted by Riot into a game where only if you act as a team can you win the game.

I'd say that it is true, League is being made into a game that is much more fun and enjoyable if you work as a team compared to attempting to solo carry. Yet I think many people are too quick to blame Riot for dictating that team-play is the path that League should follow.

Due to League being one of the most, if not the most, popular games over the past five to six years content for League is on the rise both in terms of quality and quantity. A large part of League content has always been educational but with the rise of sites such as op.gg, champion.gg, probuilds.net etc. with huge amounts of information that is easily digestible and free for anyone to use has made the game knowledge of the average player much higher than where it used to be when the game could be solo carried. There has also been a huge rise in more expensive/higher quality ways of improving at League such as Vod reviews, op.gg reviews and coaching websites.

So because the average skill is increasing and the number of players is also increasing this means that the skill difference in each division is decreasing. This means that yes one player will probably win the lane over the other but due to them being very close to the same skill level the winning players lead is going to be less than what the winning player could have achieved in the same division 2 years ago. In order to make the lead bigger the winning player has two options A) try to keep the lane phase going and build up such a lead that they can solo carry, or B) work with their four other teammates to gain leads elsewhere and win the game by becoming greater than the sum of their parts (or in this case players). Obviously the safer and more consistent of the two options is to work together with your team to win the game.

Why am I telling you this? You already know that League is being made to be a team game. The point of this long winded post is to show that League becoming a team game is due to how the game  was designed from the start, the most optimal way to play the game, has always been and always will be, as a team. Therefore Riot isn't changing their game to be this way because it's their new direction, they are simply doing what they have always done. 

So if you don't like the fact that League is becoming more and more of a team game, don't blame Riot for making a game that you used to be able to solo carry in into a game where you have to work as a team. You should instead realise that League was never supposed to be a solo carry game and either adapt or find a game that better suites your want to solo carry.

TLDR: Due to LoL being a popular and successful game for many years now educational content has increased, making the average player more skilled, therefore reducing the impact of the solo carry play style, which results in the game being easier when playing as a team and it isn't due to Riot changing their vision for League, it's simply because that is how the game has always been designed to be played.

Nick Clegg was the closest to a classical liberal we've had since Campbell-Bannerman, and arguably Clegg was the most successful Liberal leader post-1945.

"A financial asset's present value is usually the discounted value of future cashflows/growth. E.g. An office block's value is the future net rental cashflow's 'discounted' back at the investors required rate of return.

The same can be used for stocks by estimated the future value of growth or dividends.

Bonds are the easiest as they are very simply valued based on their known cashflows (coupons) and redemption value (principle).

4. The pull-up bar is for display purposes only. 

5. Please hang your spare towels on other clients‚Äô barbells: they will appreciate the extra weight. 

6. On entering the gym, greet and shake hands with all the other clients. (This is actually quite sweet).

7. Use the Smith Machine wherever possible. If it‚Äôs not possible, try harder.

It didn't create the universe or cause miracles. etc. etc ( pick and choose your own flavour of ""god"")

As for the philosophical arguments I guess you could say my perception of their value is different - I think they can be useful jumping off points to look into something - a logical manner to form a hypothesis to be tested - but are themselves proof of nothing. Often times in my current profession (programming) perfectly logical trains of thought will work exactly as expected, but sometimes you'll come up with a theory that makes a great deal of sense and is supported by some evidence but turns out totally wrong when actually put to the test.

This actually ties well into your statements about recognizing fallibility - in both cases I recognize people, including myself, are fallible and not all knowing, so things such as philosophical arguments and anecdotes that cannot be put to the test aren't by themselves useful for determining factual information, just good starting points to try to gather said information."

A single nail would do minimal damage and the tree would continue to grow around that nail until the nail is embedded in the tree entirely.

2203	"You're advocating for continued existence of law enforcement and courts, with no surefire way to pay for it. You're saying everyone will simply volunteer to pay for it because it will serve them, but that's just not true. Many people will weasel out of paying for it as much as possible, while those who pay the most for the system will have the greatest influence over it. 

For absolutely every single government system that is funded by voluntary means, the individuals that put the most into it will have the most power over it. Once they capture the system, they will be able to bend it to their will if they so desire. They can stack the courts with favorable judges, or cops that know where their bread is buttered. They can stack the healthcare system to extort individuals, they can be anti-competitive to other systems, and if they can afford that, they can probably afford to pay for judicial favor in the justice system. 

These potential issues that I'm listing, they currently exist to some extent, but the reason they exist is not the mandatory government costs (meaning taxes), they exist because of the voluntary ones. Nobody forces you to contribute anything to a politician's campaign. But the individuals that do absolutely own the government. That's how they get stadiums, tax breaks, and regulations which completely benefit them at the expense of competitors and consumers. I would hate for this sort of thing to extend to every government funded program or service. 

I find it incredibly frustrating that these issues exist today, but the thing is that if we made the system only about voluntarily paying in, then there's nothing that could challenge your influence besides an equal amount of money. With voting, (something that would also be financially crippled under a system of voluntary funding) you give citizens the power to challenge the money with their votes. Unfortunately, with the advancement of media, money influences that quite effectively as well, but it still gives is some kind of check. 

It's funny that you would never wish to live under a benevolent autocrat, but fail to realize that under your system you would ideally be living under a bunch of benevolent oligarchs. You would hope that the rich who have enough money to make these systems work would uphold and them and defend them, rather than use their power to destroy them and drain everyone else.

Even if you created an organization and pooled a bunch of your money, now you have corporate governance to deal with, which is just a smaller form of government. And if as soon as this organization chooses to spend it's money on something you don't like, you take your money out, then the organization is doomed from the start because there's no way they will be able to please all the individuals who paid in. Someone will always be taking their money out. So if they have to battle against an oligarch who has a similar amount of money, he will crush the org because he doesn't have voters to deal with, his decision is the only one that matters. 

Therefore, those with enormous sums of money have an advantage over organizations which pool their money, and you have to just pray that those individuals are benevolent enough not to financially enslave you. 

You can't get away from these people because there are systems in your life that you need to survive, like the justice system, like a healthcare system, like an environmental safety agency, like a food and drug safety agency. I mean if you think you can live without those things, then please go do that! There are plenty of places where you can go do that and pay little to no tax! But if you want to live in society then you can't live without those systems. 

Which is why a benevolent autocrat is always better then a bunch of benevolent oligarchs. Those in power will dictate how huge portions of your life goes regardless, because they will control those systems which you cannot live without unless you basically become a hermit. 

A benevolent oligarchy is even harder to establish than a benevolent autocrat because you have more people, therefore more variables. In both of those situations, we the people don't have a say. Which is why democracy is the only way to do it, but if we do not pay into the government, then only those with enormous sums of money will have power. The voice of the people will have no power. The money we put in allows for enforcement of the things we voted for, and if we are allowed to just pull our money voluntarily, then we are crippling our power vs. the oligarchy.

The bracketed word *yevrey* (lit.""Hebrew"") is the [sanitized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expurgation) form of the actual word in the title, very likely the derogatory epithet –∂–∏–¥ ([*zhid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhyd) or [*yid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yid)).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition#cite_note-13)

I'm not saying that that is your point, necessarily, but from the context it seems like you would be more for than against that position. Using the term ""loser"" frames the argument more succinctly.

&gt; wearing a shirt like that un tucked is like wearing colors that don't match. Sure it can be pulled off, but it has to be done intentionally and with thought.

I think, personally, that wearing a shirt untucked is much less of a fashion faux pas than wearing non-matching colors.

A man from Australia came up to me and said the tour boat he and his friends were on had been recalled to transport soldiers, could I take them back to their hotel? So I said yes. In the hour or two since I'd driven up, the olive groves had filled with the smell of mothballs because all the reserves had been called up in uniform and were stationed in the fields in their wool uniforms.

All ferries to and from Corfu were suspended for several days; the hostilities were ended without war in a few days, and the ferry from Corfu to Brindisi was filled to capacity with people and cars.

There was nothing I could do; people at the hotel I was at had some concerns, but nothing like the fear of an invasion of Corfu. There were no shortages of food for that short time, no problems really for us tourists. You just had to stay an extra few days, if you'd been planning on leaving the day of the invasion.

1 - I don‚Äôt mind walking, and feel good about possibly leaving a closer space available for a customer with special needs;

2 - I care about my car, and don‚Äôt like people throwing their doors or carts/carriages into my car, so some distance from the masses helps mitigate my anxieties about all that;

3 - If the person has parked apart, s/he must also care about her/his car, so is less likely to be careless with respect to my vehicle;

4 - I did not realize it would bother you if I was parked next to you, since I see you as a kindred spirit;

If the power grid is consistently producing more than is needed, that could be accounted for by increasing export... but export requires huge infrastructure. North America has 4 discrete synchronous grids. Transporting energy between these grids can only happen by first converting it to high voltage direct current. This is some expensive infrastructure. There are high voltage interconnects between grids, but new ones don't just get built on the drop of a dime because one grid produces more energy than it needs to... that should have been planned for so they would be built as the grid's output is built up.

In the short term it would probably be more economical to reduce output--get rid of some solar panels, or retire a baseload power station. But the trouble there is that might require more power from ""flexible"" sources--which is both dirtier and more expensive."	askscience	askscience	-1

are you purposely being dumb?

The ""Arcade edition"" patch is free for all existing users of SF5. So if i go to gamestop and buy a used copy of sf5 for **10-15** bucks i can just install the arcade edition patch **for free**.

if i bought sf5 **2 years ago** i get the arcade edition patch **FOR FREE**.

the main reason why the arcade edition is **40 dollars** is because it comes bundled with all dlc characters from season 1 and 2.  the season passes for both seasons cost **20 dollars each**.

so effectively the ""Arcade edition"" is just a bundle that contains the original game and the 2 season passes. people who buy the 40 dollar Arcade edition are not getting these characters ""for free"". they are paying for it.

The ""Arcade Edition"" **patch** and the dlc characters from season 1 and 2 are completely different things. 

the ""Arcade Edition"" **patch** is an update to existing sf5 that contains new modes and balance changes.  DLC characters are extra characters that you can buy with real money or fight money.

I also never said an investigation shouldn't be done. And if an investigation is done, and finds those claims DO have merit, they would no longer be unsubstantiated or uncorroborated... would they? At which point, it wouldn't be appalling to use them to influence our decision on confirmation.

2261	Limiting yes, but makes it very easy to enforce.  I have worked at companies where the tattoo rule was on the book, but never enforced until someone who was already a problem child needed to be removed.  At that point, it was viewed as cleaner to enforce that rule since he wouldn't comply with it than trying to terminate over the more gray infractions.  So everyone who had tattoos had to cover up for a bit then it slowly laxed again after he was gone.	"I'm a rape crisis counsellor and victim's advocate, so I can tell you what I tell others. 

Let him choose his own pathway, even if the choice goes against what you think is right (ie withdraws his statement from police.) sexual abuse is about removing people's control and safety, so the biggest rule of thumb is do everything the perpetrator did not. He lost the right to chose, the right to his body, the right to feel safe. So if he wants to do something stupid, your best play is to find the safest way to go through it. 

Normalise his feelings when he expresses something. It's normal to be all over the place, feel unsafe and unsure of your own sense of self and identity. Understand if it's what is needed for him, or your need to talk or not talk that might be getting in the way. Not unusual for men to not talk and find other ways to work through. Not unusual for them to get angry and aggressive as a means to ""run away,"" so be prepared for that, and try to know it's unlikely it's about you.

Counselling is not the answer to everyone, going to see a counsellor  too early can make things worse. Generally I'd say leave it 6 weeks, only worry about what coping strategies that persist after that time and that he views as a problem. People jump on the counselling wagon too early sometimes, and that can make things worse, not better. It's okay to use a crisis service to check in and get you through the rough times, but not everyone needs the full processing work with a counsellor. Some people can do that on their own. (esp. if they're well supported, and have no previous history of trauma... Though everyone responds so differently!) RAINN has some great online info and services if you're American. 

If you do go through court, use those victim advocacy/support services on offer and get them to talk you through the court processes and help liaise with police/courts. They have a different language and it is a soul destroying space. No one gets through it intact, and the victim's voice is easily lost. Get those professionals to do the heavy lifting for you.

Get yourself help. If you feel your partner needs support, but is refusing, it is great for helping you work through the emotions around it. If he discloses stuff about the assault, that can be so heavy to handle, having someone to talk to can help you be the best wife you can be (you already are, btw.) You can only help the ones you love through trauma if you've got your own shit together, and he'll need you. So please think of yourself.

2262	Anything could happen in the future, but HRC was talking about a no-fly zone during the campaign which would have escalating things significantly.	"I think you are partially right, but only in a very broad strokes.

What you're witnessing here is the war between the king (or Kings) and the usuper with his cohorts. Both side want absolute power and control, but comes from different grounds. The Kings, who while gradually loosing their grip on the serfs, still holds the church, the army and the land. Because the Kings still holds these things, the usuper has to breaking them one by one, while getting the serfs to follow and setting them up to die for him. So the fight ensured.

Now, Trump (as the usurper) are trying to took down the pillars of power one by one and took over, while the Kings (the shadow govt) are trying to pull his army off and took him down. So far, Trump has took down the church (the media) and the Kings are furious. So they have to employ their army (the Intel agency) to take him down.

"Now I'm worried... I'm a guy, first of all. So I have this one friend (a girl) that I've known since first year of university (almost 5 years ago) and back then she was pretty overweight. Of course I never mentioned it, she's a super cool person and that's all that mattered. After first year I didn't see her much, but she'd still come to our house parties and such over the years. Well about 1 year ago, she got serious about losing weight and she changed her lifestyle. So a couple weeks ago I was with my friends and one of them said ""Yoo look at [friend] these days!"" And he showed us her instagram and she looked like a completely different person! She had lost A LOT of weight. She wasn't skinny per se, but she was looking better then she ever has.

So last week I saw her snapchat story, she's been studying abroad for the last year. Seeing her story reminded me of that, so I messaged her to catch up. I told her that what I was gonna say was not me trying to be creepy at all. I just told her that she's looking really great these days, and wanted to congratulate her for her hard work. Also let her know that my friends (we're all in the same friend group) all think the same thing.

Would that still be considered rude? I just thought that she might like to hear that since she put so much effort into making a change for herself. I really hope that I wasn't out of line saying those things...

* The JP fandom has been discussing ÂÆ∂ like an Armin/Eren/Mikasa shared separate dwelling rather than a Survey Crops dorm building. Though I have to look back and see if they call the barracks something specific (hmm, I was thinking maybe Military Police dorm was given a specific kanji in the past?) Maybe if you remember in one of the guidebooks or something that mentions their living quarters? 

* Again, the redundancy is plain awkward. No one ever says Â∏∞„Å£„Å¶  and follows it up with ÁßÅÈÅî„ÅÆÂÆ∂„Å´. 'Go back home' is built into Â∏∞„Çã by default? So many JP fans think Isayama is hinting at their childhood home being rebuilt, rather than a parallel with CH.6(?).

------------------

* Wwwww~ Of course, it's always the pronoun-less bubbles that get misinterpreted and mistranslated the most. Just intuitively by the flow of the bubbles, I naturally read like ""Eren is at his limit, he can't do anything to Reiner in his condition= Retreat"". So I had to stretch it a bit to re-think the grammar into mistaking that it was Reiner who can't kill Eren. I was wondering if I had gone crazy for a bit. My Chinese reading ability is somewhere like 80-90%, but I was pretty sure your version was also the same pronounless way? But the interpretation and story flow would only have it that way.

* (It must be super convenient for you to be able to read the JP and CH raw every time!)

----------

* I see the official English version do strange things with a lot of idioms and pre/suffixes for titles. I believe that they have to localize everything for the Western translation?

* Maybe someone missed the nuance there. But wouldn't „Åæ„Åü literally mean 'again' anyway? That's a weird error to make, too.

However, one thing that campaigns do to extract money is pay for things at an exorbent rate. We actually did see this with Clinton (they all do it, but at least we saw it happening through her emails) where they'd ""owe"" an ally some money so they'd buy a voter call list that's been curated and sold for way over price. But since there is no real stable and known market value for these things, the FEC doesn't count them in their audit. But trust me, at the end of every campaign, the coffers rapidly get depleted, even moreso if they know they will likely lose.

There are also complicated debt balancing tricks they do to extract money, in almost every campaign I've seen... Again, to funnel money to allies. But from what I've seen working in anti-money in politics PACs is it's usually set up like campaign takes on debt from XYZ, then campaign ends, and debt contracts are handed over to the party and then the party pays it off. These people are almost exclusively well established political insiders who just fundraise and in return get paid huge checks from the party. It's how the game is played.

I've also seen it where the contract is for several years, still paying out years after the campaign is over.

NBN have overpriced the hell out of the ""middle leg"" of data transit to the point that ISP's can no longer provide the product people want, at a price people are prepared to pay. There are more expensive premium providers that are better, but still rarely perfect.

ADSL had line length issues, but outright congestion was a much less common issue simply because an ISP could afford to have a reasonable amount of backhaul capacity - there was enough bandwidth to go around.

Now people don't want to be paying heaps more for NBN, so retail prices haven't changed that much, but the ISP can't afford (at those prices) to put in as much backhaul so speeds suffer. This is further compounded by the fact that higher speeds than ever are on offer too (though I'm not going to complain about that fact lol).

NBN needs to lower backhaul rates to a point where at least ISP's can offer a comparable product to the ADSL everyone used to get, otherwise we're all just going backwards.

As well, most graduates will spend the next 10 years minimum in debt from their education, having a hard time finding work in the field of their study, and most likely working minimum wage jobs only to live paycheque to paycheque, never getting ahead of their debt. 

It‚Äôs no surprise that after having all this established success shoved in their face by the media and our society of commercialism, seeing the older generations living the life because insurance was cheap and optional for them, where it‚Äôs costly and bound into law today, where credit was a vague notion to them, while it‚Äôs the only means of making a significant purchase today, because the credit company lobbyists applied enough pressure to enforce their agenda, making you depend on their credit score system to buy the things you need in life.

In my opinion, judging someone let's say for a century for the sins they had commit cannot impact a person because after one century of judgment he goes back and is able to enjoy all eternity of heaven.

God created people in the Garden of Eden and His intention was not that we ever end up where we did. 

But God gave us that option to walk away from Himself because if we did not have the option to do so, our love for Him would no longer be real. 

If you have a wife and she does not have the option to ever walk away from you, to cheat on you, or to even argue with you, she is under your complete submission... She might be a good wife?! I guess? But does she love you if she has no other choice but to be with you?

It's authoritarianism, first and foremost, and in terms of looking out for the majority of people, it's just a middle ground between European style liberal democracy and Russian style kleptocracy. It might be communitarian, but it's still highly oligarchical, I'd argue likely due to really heavily ingrained Confucian ideals of filial piety and loyalty. The government is trying to increase prosperity of all citizens (at least, citizens it deems ""important"", ie predominantly Han people in the east, as opposed to ethnic minorities in the west/south), but only in that it recognizes that failure to provide for those it rules is a threat to stability, and stability is valued over all things. 

I get that it's more communitarian as opposed to individualistic. But at the same time, I think the ""left vs right"" divide has a lot more to it than just individualism vs communitarianism (at root, anyway).

I had a male coworker - who was much older than I am - who would do the same stuff. Ask personal questions, tell me about himself, complain that hes lonely and doesnt understand why girls like him, and a long list of many other things. 

I worked at a Kroger fuel booth, so I was literally stuck with him, until I convinced my managers to move me inside the main store (it helped I knew how to be a cashier, bagger, customer service clerk, work in the bakery and produce section, and other things).

But he would still hangout inside around me on his breaks, come early and leave work late if I was working, come in on his days off. I told him off several times, saying how he made.me uncomfortable and it just seemed creepy to me.

This whole time hes known I had a boyfriend, my boyfriend has visited several dozen times to bring me coffee or food or whatever, even when I got engaged and wore the ring he still behaved that way. He actually started leaving notes on my car after I got engaged, saying how he missed working with me in the fuel station, and how if I'm a cashier it's hard for him to talk to me and such. 

It took me quitting my job (due to being super pregnant) for him to leave me alone (also note I've had his number blocked on my phone this whole time, and dont use my Facebook so that didnt help him) 

He did pester my sister about me for a good 6 months (she worked in the bakery at the same store) until she told him off, straight up cursing him out for a good 10 minutes about how inappropriate he was being, and how if I haven't answered him or came to see him, maybe it means I dont want anything to do with him.

This removes the option from any worker not in such a position to accept a wage in between the current minimum and the hypothetical family-supporting wage; ergo reducing the number of successful worker-employer negotiations, i.e. reduced employment oppertunities.

If, as a nation, the society felt poor families had a right to a certain minimum level of financial means, then there are ways to enable that. I don't feel that using the minimum wage would be an effective way of achieving that goal.

Many minimum wage workers are working such jobs because, due to their lack of in-demand skills, they are barely employable.

To disable a service, simply right-click then click Stop.

- Diagnostic Policy Service
-Service for SHIELD Streaming
- Distributed Link Tracking Client (if PC is not connected to Wi-Fi)
- Offline Files
- Program Compatibility Assistant Service
- Portable Device Enumerator Service
- Print Spooler (if you don't use a printer)

- Windows Error Reporting Service (Microsoft doesn't respond really so...)
- Windows Image Acquisition (If you don't use a scanner)
There. That's all of the services you can disable (or set to Manual) for optimized gaming.
Also, afterwards, before restarting your PC, I suggest:
1. Go to ""System"" settings in Control Panel
2. Click on 'System protection'
3. Click on 'Configure'
4. Turn on 'disable system protection'

Also, reliability of a man can change because of age. That's why the reliable hadith has more other sources who confirms what was done and said by Muhammad saws. All say the same before a hadith is classified.

What I wanted to pick up on was ""why there are more resources for female victims"". The proportion of DV that ends in murder is tiny, less than 1%, statistically insignificant. However, nearly all of the resources are aimed at women. Whatever you consider the relative weight of risk, its not enough to justify women being the only concern in practice. The resources measure all the IPV which happens to men as insignificant."

2329	"Thanks, physioworld. It's nice to get another thoughtful and interesting reply. I'll try my best to address your objections. 

&gt;it is more analogous to playing squash alone- you can practice the game, enjoy yourself and do something worthwhile. It isn't the same as a full game, probably isn't as good, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

Squash is a game invented by men to be played between two men. It follows that a man can *practice* squash by himself but he cannot play squash by himself any more than he can sing a duet by himself. 

But what's wrong with hitting a squash ball by yourself so long as you don't claim to be playing squash? There is an important difference here. And to see it I think we need to appeal to the Aristotelian idea of final causes. Sexual energy is intrinsically ordered toward the other; that is, the normal and healthy end to which sexual energy is directed is unitive and reproductive intercourse between a man and a woman. For sexual energy to be directed at any other end is simply what it means to be disordered. 

&gt;As for your next point about it being quasi-homosexual, even if I accept your line of argument and agree that it is, so what? Homosexualty is wrong only from a fairly narrow christian perspective.

I think the arguments here are as strong or stronger than those against masturbation. However, as I said in my footnote, I did not want to pursue the matter here. But see *Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy* by Richard Swinburne, p.303-306. This might be the subject of my next post.

&gt;I don't see that you demonstrated its selfishness. 

Masturbation is paradigmatically narcissistic. Can that really be denied? 

&gt;Arguably if masturbating caused couples to devote less sexual energy to their partner than they otherwise would then there is something there, but for the single person it can't detract from anothers pleasure and even in a couple, in my experience it actually enhances desire.

There is something to be said for saving your sexual pleasure for the woman you love‚Äîfor letting your spouse have a monopoly on your sexual pleasure and for making her body the only naked body you enjoy. Not only does it make sexual pleasure something special shared only between the two of you, but it gives her an erotic power and allure over you that I can attest inspires adoration, fascination and devotion. It therefore has a powerful unitive effect. I think you do a disservice to your wife and your relationship by diluting this by masturbating (especially when coupled with pornography depicting the bodies of other woman) and I think denying her that, and denying your relationship that, because you insist on arrogating pleasure to yourself by masturbating to porn in private is very selfish.

Plus, you know, what Lewis said. The mechanism by which monogamous sex sans masturbation produces virtue needs to be addressed by any opponent of my argument.

&gt;I'm actually somewhat with you on the question of pornography

I'm glad to hear it.

&gt;However i can honestly say that if a friend or relation of mine wanted to do porn and was able to prevent the industry from abusing him/her ... I would have no objection

I assume you speak of someone you love. To love someone is to will their good. What about the objection that her choice prevents the richest fulfilment of human sexuality in unitive romantic sex between monogamous heterosexual spouses leading to children and family love? How could you not wish this for anyone you love? I have already given arguments for why this *is* the richest fulfilment of human sexuality.  

&gt;One could find an analogy with the way that tech is manufactured in some parts of the world. There is nothing implicitly wrong with assembling circuit boards for apple,

But my argument is that pornography is implicitly wrong and worse when it entails aggression and abuse.

&gt;This argument holds with respect to any form of pornography whatever; but it holds a fortiori with respect to the sort of pornography that has become almost normative online in recent times"	What makes you think that religion would die?

Personally, I think Bitcoin has problems, but the fundamental idea (as iterated on by competing cryptocurrency systems) doesn't have many of the problems the author mentions and has a number of benefits the author strangely omits in favor of pretending the whole purpose of Bitcoin was to not pay fees.

The rapid rise in value isn't because of a fixed supply of coins as the author states because... we're far from reaching that limit. It's not because we can't ""print"" money because at this stage, we are able to mine currency which is printing money. The rapid rise in value is because of the rapid rise in how many people value it.

The limit to the amount of transactions Bitcoin can process is largely based on arbitrary technical decisions that were made by the small group of developers that control Bitcoin and could be changed at any time. Also the point about waiting a while for transactions to settle ""unlike"" Visa is misleading. There is often a period of hours to days between when a person swiped their card and when that transaction is actually processed and reflected as well.

The author keeps arbitrarily suggesting that the purpose of Bitcoin is to have no ""fees"" and then suggesting that if it carries fees that it's pointless. That's not really true. We already have a way of paying without a processing fee: cash. Bitcoin's value isn't about less fees, it's about less control. Bitcoin doesn't require you to reveal anything about yourself, doesn't require you to get permission in order to perform a transaction and doesn't carry any ""terms"" you must agree to. With alternatives, payment companies can arbitrarily and without warning deny the processing of funds (e.g. wikileaks, fetlife), generally collect and share information about you and your use of the accounts, try to monetize you and require you to agree to a variety of terms. Bitcoin's appeal is getting rid of that stuff.

&gt; There is, of course, a pretty simple solution here. That's just ... increasing bitcoin's memory. The people who run it, though, have ruled that out. Why? Because that would require a modicum of trust, and they want to abolish that entirely.

The people who run Bitcoin are employed by a company which develops software for doing off-chain transactions. In other words, they directly profit from hindering the capacity of Bitcoin so that is likely why they aren't increasing the ""memory"".

&gt; If you don't want to do that, then you can't really add more bandwidth to the bitcoin system. Here's why: The more data there is, the more computing power you'd need to win the mathematical races that decide who gets new coins. And in that case, mid-sized miners would have a harder and harder time competing.

That's not true. There are alternative algorithms that can be used. And right now, mining is intentionally hard. Difficulty can be adjusted. Also, the block size is far enough from being a burden that decent increases to it wouldn't reach the point of pricing out mid and small sized miners."	Economics	Economics	-1

I think you need to just be honest about it. Tell him you're struggling with alcohol dependence and that you are going to take a break. You need him to understand this so he doesn't offer you one drink. If he isn't supportive, you may need to reevaluate your relationship. Sobriety is hard enough, I can't imagine trying to do it without a supportive SO. "	And also, people change SO MUCH from their teens, to early twenties, to late twenties.

That would have been even worse.  First, he would be risking Walder just arresting him and holding him prisoner.  Secondly, Robb has neither any experience negotiating or knowledge about Walder Frey.  Thirdly, Robb wouldn't be able to humble himself in the same way that Catelyn could that helped convince Walder to join their cause.  Instead, he would likely act similar to Tywin in his demands which would prick Frey's pride so he would close any communications with him.

It wasn't simply for a river crossing.  Walder Frey literally lent Robb 4000 men and gave Catelyn two wards (aka hostages) in exchange.  Hell, he even agreed to allow a garrison to be placed in castle to keep an eye on him."	"He has defeated Greyjoy fleet in sea. The same Greyjoys who destroyed Lannisport.

He lost Blackwater because Davos's mistake, not his. 

And Renly was a fucking traitor. He was a rebel. Stannis gave him a chance, but Renly refused.

Spider-man can dodge bullets, or get hit by a car and walk it off, it make sense for him to put himself in extremely dangerous situations by himself.

2373	The other option I‚Äôd suggest is to pay teachers higher wages in general.  Education plays a huge role in the development in the future.  If it was treated like it did, it might encourage the talent to get involved.  	I actually studied the connection between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and HSV while an intern at an AD research foundation a few years ago. While I have no sources with me at the moment, we found that there was a statistically significant correlation between the beta-amyloid plaques characteristic of AD and an HSV infection in the central nervous system. Herpes viruses lie dormant in the neurons of the brain, but can activate and reactivate throughout the course of its host's life. It is a common opinion that the beta-amyloid plaques form from an aberrant protein folding, which causes them to self-aggregate similar to prion diseases. The exact relationship between AB-plaques and AD was not entirely certain during the time I was an intern, although I'm sure advancements in that correlation have appeared between then and now. I chose to pursue a less-common opinion: that the aggregation of amyloid-beta was an antimicrobial response to pathogens in the CNS. AB seemed to have a similar appearance to a few types of antimicrobial proteins found in other parts of the body, and HSV was commonly found entangled in AB plaques. One counterpoint that I considered but did not have time to explore further (mine was a summer internship) was that amyloid beta plaques were simply sticky, and picked up cellular debris at random. It has been years since I have studied this field, and my memory has lapsed a bit since then. If I were not on vacation away from my work computer, I would include links to the studies I researched to come to the tenuous conclusion that more research was needed into AB's possible antimicrobial function. I am overjoyed to see that this possibility is being explored. 	science	science	-1

"I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh, but as a military spouse myself who has had some major ups and downs with my husband and watched our friends experience the same in their marriages, you sound like a coward tbh.

You should go to counseling. My husband and I have been together since 18 and have fallen in and out of love a hundred times. Most notably at 21 and 25 and 30. I imagine it will happen at least once a decade from now on. That‚Äôs part of the deal. It‚Äôs easy to fall out of love when you stop putting positive energy towards something.

It seems to me that you don‚Äôt know what you asked her to sign up for when you joined and that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs really impossible to understand when you are young, but it‚Äôs not necessarily her failing, and it seems like you have zero idea of what life is like on her side.

She is young and will move on and get married to someone who will cherish her and you might do the same, there are definitely positives that can come from this, but the alternative, staying with the woman you promised to love forever and being a man of your word and finding out how to grow back together despite pretty difficult circumstances (that YOU chose to expose her to) is what will actually make you a better person than you are right now, and that‚Äôs what life is all about."	relationships	relationships	-1

I was told how he was a responsibility of my parents and that when he was old enough that he would take his cues off me. I felt no jealousy or resentment over his treatment. When my sister was born they gave him the same speech. Kids also don't have to be appeased when you explain to them what's going on isn't taking away from their world but adding to it. But for some strange reason it's easier to pacify rather than guide someone through the emotions. 	My mom used to take photos of us kids before field trips or large family gatherings in public.

There are many different interpretations of the OT writings and laws, so your parents are not really being ignorant when they say that.

For instance, the Torah/OT included a rule that said that disobedient sons could be put to death after being found guilty by a council of elders. Barbaric, right? Well, actually, this rule represented a great moral progress for the time: with one stroke, it preserved parental authority and at the same time put an end to arbitrary honor killings (which were very common at the time, and actually still happens today in some parts of the world), since it required an independent council to judge each issue. And there is no evidence anyone has ever been condemned by such a council.

I dont care what Trump says about it, I form my own opinion from observations and while he may have his own agenda, he isnt completely wrong about the media.

Should there be free speech? Sure, but there should also be moderation on it. For decades, even more so in recent years, the media thrives on panic and BOOM effect on the audience. The titles are misleading, data isnt sourced, they tend to forget to list scale for comparison when reporting about researches, they hide very crucial details in small, hidden text and the list goes on and on.

So when a news source says ""Oh yeah, Russia totally hacked elections, we have 5 intelligence agencies who all came to the same conclusion"" whats the first thing I want? Obviously a source, a research, something concrete and not just speculation but usually, thats just too classified for the general public so what you are left of with is the word of one party or the other and hope its true.

I dont live in US nor do I particularely care about it but in my country the major news media are heavily influenced by the west and its disgusting, even to the point where people just laugh at them when asked for an interview.

2426	"It's not the full reason, but [part of it is cost disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease) (Economist [article](http://www.economist.com/node/21563714)). Certain labour intensive sectors have lower productivity growth than the rest of the economy. However, to retain and employ new staff they have to keep up with rising wages in the rest of the economy. The inevitable result of this is rising prices. You see it in healthcare to a huge extent. The point raised by Baumol is very true and applies to education too:

&gt;The real problem is not the cost disease, Mr Baumol argues, but knee-jerk reactions to it. The most likely response to spiralling budgets for publicly provided medicine and education is to shift provision to the private sector. But that will not cure the underlying disease. High costs could also lead to excessive rationing, slowing development over the long term.

&gt;If it happens, such a reaction rests on a mistaken premise: that the rising costs in the stagnant sectors make people poorer. In fact, buying power is growing much faster than medicine, education and the arts are becoming dearer. Mr Baumol‚Äôs crystal ball says that in 100 years a live performance of a Mozart quartet will be vastly more expensive, but people will still be able to afford it.

As he says, our kneejerk reaction could be very damaging, especially in healthcare we are seeing this very acutely in the UK, with more and more people dying because the state isn't willing to pony up the increasing costs. 

It's also one reason why the student loan system can be good, it allows more investment. [Prior to the introduction state rationing meant lower and lower levels of investment in education.](https://i.gyazo.com/08622f13afce7ad15ea15fb72879036c.png) Of course, it doesn't solve the issue because fees are still capped at the end of the day.

I hope he winds up placed in a fantastic school that can undo the damage. A special ed teacher should be excited to report to the parent any tiny improvement in his work--even public school special ed teachers who face resistance by policy and sometimes their own colleagues at the school.

As a gen-ed teacher, and mom of a kid with an IEP (for much milder circumstances), I've seen how overwhelming it is for all parties involved. From teacher perspective, I have six IEPs in my class, each with separate accommodations and goals. 

Examples of accommodations (each child has different ones, not all of these): 
1. fewer questions on a page
2. highlight questions/important phrases
3. create flashcards
4. read instructions aloud
5. repeat all instructions multiple times &amp; check for understanding
6. allow extra time to complete assignments and tests
7. allow extra time for responses to questions
8. use pictures for new words &amp; preview them the day before lesson
9. use slow, clear gestures to suggest meanings 
10. use goal charts w/stickers on child's desk, rewarding and/or reminding specific behaviors
11. ""chunk"" the work
12. give positive phrase often 
13. redirect students--sometimes every two or three minutes
14. use a timer and give breaks--sometimes with specific activities
15. give student stress balls, items with textures (soft, rough, bumpy--whatever soothes student
16. use manipulative for subjects (especially math)
17. sit the student up front
18. have a high-achieving, patient peer support student frequently 
19. use graphic organizers
20. use small homogenous groups 50% of the time and heterogenous groups the other 50%
21. give one-on-one instruction with new information
22. review homework and give reduced work
23. have student practice specific speech sounds in responses to you
24. have student repeat all instructions to you before moving on 
25. check on student's progress during lesson and, if student struggles, give alternate explanations
26. do sample problems together first, before independent work
27. allow alternative forms of communication for work answers--perhaps orally or by using pictures to communicate 
28. help with organization, study habits, and memory skills
29. keep student in a quiet environment
30. speak softly/loudly
31. look for signs of escalation and/or frustration
32. Do not touch student even when aggressive or violent, but call for specially trained staff while keeping the student from hurting himself or others without raising your voice. 
33. And there are others

(Bear in mind, most teachers and I do lots of these things for all students because it helps the kids and makes it easier on us.)

Examples of goals students must measure: 

""With minimal prompts by teacher, student will be able to identify the main idea in a text and follow its development through the text. Student will respond correctly and in complete sentences 4 out of 5 times with 75% accuracy."" 

(This is not an actual goal of any student of mine, but it is very typical of one of three or more goals measured per student.)

This is all to be done in a 30-student classroom and other kids who have challenges and some who perhaps need special ed themselves.

You do your best and keep in mind how each kid must feel. Some of them report feeling dumb or thought to be dumb, unaccepted, unable to make friends, bullied stared at, criticized and laughed at by peers when they want to be ""normal."" 

These kids can learn, but perhaps they cannot express and/or understand it in the singular, same, old way we have taught for way too long. It's a mess.

I have a hard time with the ""gosh, we didn't know"" stance the school presents. If you have a burnt-out or unqualified teacher like the one in the recording, they have likely exhibited this same attitude in faculty/staff meetings, casual conversations, in front of mentor teachers, or even the principal! Word gets around. It's hard to believe no one there knew about or talked about this.

Special ed students his age are considered unable to advocate for themselves (They're too young!). The parent does. Just my opinion of course, but the tape should stand. The school was not forthright with the inability of their staff to meet the qualification levels of the school's advertising and promises, and the mother advocated because she suspected wrongdoing at the expense of her minor child.

One man's masterpiece is another man's garbage, and there is no ""correct"" opinion or score, the closest you can come is the consensus; what most people think, but that will always be wildly unhelpful for some people.

that's probably the reason why they are adding the singleplayer races and tracks into sport afterwards....to get a feeling for everything you know.

Or it could be that the environment is forgiving enough that it allows for some mutations to go unfiltered. If some elephants somehow started having slightly greener skins, and maybe green elephants liked other green elephants better, you would pretty soon (in elephant terms) have a whole subspecies of green elephants.

Not many creatures kill elephants, and the ones that do, would probably kill them the same, green or not.

However it is considered an incorrect theory amongst investors, who tend to believe that there are market inefficiencies (caused by human imperfections, like the tendency to act emotionally or with bias, and the fact that we have imperfect information) that you can capitalize on to beat the market. 

Some markets are definitely more efficient than others too.

"They absolutely are waning. Many studies in recent years have found that developed nations are becoming more secular, these nations generally score better on metrics used to determine societal health, and movements like secular humanism are growing rapidly in the US. You also see far fewer followers of orthodoxy and an explosion of ""progressive"" belief that is a regression of actual doctrine. The new God is more vague and weaker than ever.

I don't think I would agree that god belief is a pathway to rational principles. It seems to me to be almost entirely the opposite. As Steven Weinberg said, it takes religion to make a good man do bad things.

2481	"[From the whitepaper:] (https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf)

&gt;RaiBlocks achieves consensus via a balance-weighted vote on conflicting transactions. This consensus system provides quicker, more deterministic transactions while still maintaining a strong, decentralized system.

If I correctly understand the details of how RaiBlocks transactions work (and I may not), each new transaction is broadcast to the network. Listening nodes then automatically re-broadcast this new block with their vote signature attached. If I have that right, then the legitimacy of a transaction is basically assumed until a conflicting transaction is observed, at which point it is voted on with node's total balance as weight."
