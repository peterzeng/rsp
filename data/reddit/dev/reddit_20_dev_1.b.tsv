some logic on the server(s) behind `shady.example.com` create a DNS record for `$random.example.com` which points to whatever IP the JS found.  at the end of 5 seconds, the JS makes a call to `$random.example.com` which is going to point to `192.168.1.1` (or whatever...).

15	"I define ""E"" as just ""Evasion,"" which *is* a useful category to keep in mind.  It's easy to get caught up in fighting a ground game but you'll generally do better if you have a few flyers in there.  Alternatively, knowing that E is one of the categories can remind you that you at least need a game plan against flyers, so maybe you pick up a Giant Spider instead of a fifth 2-drop.

""A"" can, again, give you two directions of help: you need to have early drops or a plan to fight against early drops.  This is less important in some formats and more important in others.  [DeTora's 2012 guide](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/melissadetora-041212-a-beginners-guide-to-drafting/) basically defines this as ""draft a curve.""  It's easy for new players to go after all the big, expensive creatures and neglect their early game.

""D"" is there because it has to be there as long as Wizards keeps printing Tolarian Scholars.

Yes, sometimes you just need a vanilla 2/3 for 3 and you'll draft one if you have to, but you should still pick it with purpose.  Categories help you figure out your purpose for picking each card.

And basically all residence halls in universities have designated quiet hours. OP isn't obeying them. Does that not make him the asshole?	"I currently live in a dorm with 3 other people, we each have our separate bedrooms. There's 2 bedrooms right next to each other (separated by a thin wall), a living room and kitchen, and 2 more bedrooms.
I have early morning classes every day, and I attempt to go to sleep at 10:30PM and 11:30 at the absolute latest. The roommate who's bedroom is right next to mine is a classic night owl, sleeps between 2-4AM (nightmare for someone like me to sleep early). I'm the type of person that I have a hard time falling asleep, but if I do sleep it's deep enough that it's really hard to wake me up.
Every night at 9 until like 1 he plays videos on his phone through its speaker (he doesn't have headphones it seems), and randomly decides to turn off the air conditioner by himself. We always close our bedroom doors for privacy, and if you close the door it gets steaming hot and unbearable to sleep in (bad ventilation I assume). So I like to turn air conditioner on so that my room isn't burning. If I turn on air conditioner though, he leaves his room just to turn it off and go back to his room. And he doesn't just leave his room and subtly turn it off. He tries to make it known that he's turning it off (stomping really loudly and then turns off air conditioner. He doesn't stomp when leaving his room for anything else).
So eventually I couldn't handle it and decide to sternly tell him to ""buy earphones/ear buds and to wear thicker if you're cold. You can cure coldness by wearing thicker, but you can't take off your skin if you're hot.""
He then procedeed to call me a selfish asshole who wants everything in life to be my way and how he shouldn't be obligated to buy earphones just because I want him to. AITA?"	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	1

30	It’s just messed up that I have to answer to them because they have basically forced me to partially use their finances. I didn’t ask for that and I’m not willing to wait 4 years just because they can’t seem to let go of me.	"When I was searching for apartments when I first moved across the country, I insisted that I pay for rent myself. I was financially able to and wanted to. However, my parents continually pressured me into taking money from them to live in a more expensive part of the city. I did not need to, but they like controlling my life and wanted me to live in a luxury apartment, and even though I continually told them that I did not want or need their money to pay for a place to live, they made me feel bad for rejecting their offer. So in an effort to honor their wishes I just gave up and accepted. Now I am in a situation where they contribute in part to my rent although I told them time and time again that I don’t need or want them to. They like being in control of my life but portray it in a way that they are being good parents. I don’t know what to do in this circumstance because it feels like they have trapped me in a situation where I am indebted to them and it isn’t fair.

The bigger issue is that they always second guess my judgment even though I have always done right by them. I have always excelled in school, never got drunk or went to parties, have been the kid that many look up to in my church. I have never done anything that has provided grounds for a reasonable person to doubt my ability to make decisions, and yet they do not take me seriously as an adult.

I know they mean well, but they are really bad at letting me live my own life. I am their first child and closer relationally to them than my younger brother, which may be at play here as well."	Christianity	Christianity	1

Honestly, if you can redesign it so it will break away and not be in your sleeve, youll probably be good to go. But if you cant then youre better off trying to redesign it to be a piece of forearm armor thats tough and will absorb some of the impact for you.

33	"Your brows look fantastic! Great balance between defined and natural.
One thing I think would help is tightlining your eyes. Right now, you can see the skin of your upper eyelid/lashline peeking through your eyelashes underneath your eyeliner. If you took a black pencil eyeliner and ran it through your eyelashes or in your upper waterline, it would help your liquid liner blend in better and your lashes look fuller.
It also looks to me like your eyeshadow is extending up to your brow bone. This is personal preference (as is everything :)), but for an everyday look I would try to keep the color concentrated just above the place where your eyelid folds, maybe going about halfway up the space between the fold and your brow.
Your eye color is stunning, and the pinky shadows you chose are perfect complimentary colors to help emphasize it. Great choice!
I'm also jealous of your eyeliner application skills. I can never get a smooth line with an eyeliner pen . . . my shaky hands demand gel. haha

34	"Different mammals produce milk that has different fat/calorie content, depending on how often they breastfeed.  So, for example, rabbits produce milk that’s very high in fat and calories because a mother rabbit only feeds her babies every 12 hours; rabbits are “nest mammals” - meaning, the babies stay in a nest and the mom comes to check on them and feed them every 12 hours.  Cow milk is moderately high in fat/calories because cows are “follow mammals” - the baby calf follows the momma and breastfeeds more frequently.  

Humans, like other primates, are “carry mammals” who breastfeed more or less continuously.  A baby primate is basically clinging to the mother all the time and nursing all the time.  Human milk, like other primate milk, is very watery and low in calories compared to the milk of follow mammals or nest mammals.

Since neither dogs nor cats are “carry mammals”, presumably their milk will have more fat and calories in it than human milk, and a puppy or kitten won’t thrive on human milk. 

TL;DR - don’t breastfeed your kitten."	In general, on average, human milk is waterier then the milk of other mammals.  It’s enough for human babies because they nurse so frequently, but it couldn’t sustain a “nest mammal” for 12 hours.  I agree that foremilk is different from hindmilk, but neither one would make a kitten very happy.	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1

39	"I’m also a gay man, but I have been circumcised on account of the medical industry lacking knowledge on the matter. Even if we don’t have to worry about women in sexual and romantic relationships (aside from particular situations), there’s still very toxic things that affect all men in western culture. People will still have more accusatory attitudes towards us as males, since they wouldn’t be able to immediately identify sexuality. We can also still be accused of sexual assault as well, though I think it’s sometimes considered a more legitimate defense to be gay. Prison sentencing is also still a big deal, and being gay doesn’t mitigate it to any degree (at least, I don’t think it does).

Something that is more personal to me is the treatment of boys in the education system, since the attitudes currently have been a promotion of feminine behavior and a disregard for masculine behavior. I feel that this promotes some men to act effeminately even if it’s more against their nature. Though, for me, I never really wound up that way. I would sometimes act effeminately, but for the most part, I was always far more masculine and those behaviors have been more appealing to me, which is why I always had more guy friends. 

I sort of understand your feelings about companionship because I always had difficulties maintaining friendships. School was always the driving factor for friends, and I didn’t always excel at school, so it was a more toxic lifestyle of placing my studies over making friends and doing things with them. My biggest regret is probably feeling like I gave up discovering myself more when I was younger, but I have only recently become an adult and still have time to engage in college shenanigans. 

As for a father figure, I do have my dad, but I did feel animosity towards him often when I was younger. I think this was honestly more normal in certain aspects, but there were genuine issues I had when I was younger that weren’t really addressed and so it caused issues in all of my relationships. However, more recently, I’ve been growing away from him because of my issues with the democratic party and feminism, of which he’s both a democrat and a feminist. I don’t think he sees my concerns as legitimate, but that isn’t surprising based on behaviors that I feel are common in male feminists. I hope he watches The Red Pill at some point, since my mother did see it and she now agrees with my position on feminism more, though she’s still a Democrat because my opinions have been more shaped by youtubers. 

tl;dr gay men are still men and therefore are involved in this fight for men’s rights as well. "	Aren’t there already groups which do this? Why bother with the boy scouts? Of course, the girl scouts will likely remain unaffected. 	MensRights	MensRights	1

So I am Indian with conservative parents who wanna act like the ""cool"" parents who I can talk to about anything under the sun but I really can't cause they're full of shit.

Basically, today I got home from school and just like any other day I rang the doorbell and my mom came to answer, except this time she looked visibly distraught. She's usually happy to me or at the very least smiles, so I immediately knew something was off and I kinda figured in like 5 seconds what this must be about, thank god my dad is travelling. She sits me down and straight up confronts me about it and I was kinda speechless for a solid minute. Then my all my weed research kicked in and I proceeded to try and convince her it wasn't really bad at all. In the frame of mind I also asked her to try it for herself and see there wasn't anything bad about it. This was a mistake. 

She began crying and yelling and create such a huge scene that I'm pretty sure the neighbors thought she found a gun with a bloody rag or something. I then tried to calm her down but every time she'd just instigate herself. Finally the conversation now moved on to the fact that I was some sort of ""junkie"" now and that my whole life was basically ruined. All efforts to appeal to the contrary were swiftly shut down and I had already been labeled, it was too late. She then proceeded to pry about where I got it from and I sold out immediately because it wasn't ashamed about it and she saw that. Finally she asked my why I didn't just apologize and promise that I'd never do it again. I guess all parents want is to be lied to.

TL;DR
I got caught with weed and till now I've gotten my phone confiscated, I'm getting kicked outta my room to a room downstairs where I guess they can keep an eye on me and I don't get any money now. That's all for now but I'm 100% sure there's more since I haven't spoken to my dad as of yet. I'll add edits as and when more shit goes down. Enjoy reading about my pain! Also ANY advice would be much appreciated.

### What You **Should Have** SAID

&gt; Hey, I’m tired from my trip and flights. I need a day or two by myself to relax/get situated/catch up on work/sleep/whatever. I’m really looking forward to seeing you - let’s plan on [activity in future]. I’ll call you [at desired time in future].


What you *say* should match what you *feel, think, and want.* It’s very easy to do, just takes some practice. 


&gt; but he made it seem like I was being a bitch


Because he was excited to see his gf after spring break ... only to find that his gf was inexplicably blowing him off (with pathetic excuses, no less). 

When our gf/bf acts like they don’t want to see us and are increasingly hostile/evasive, generally we assume something is quite wrong. Not kind to do to your partner. 

Poor communication skills **frequently** make non-bitchy, well-meaning people appear as though they are in fact being bitches. 

When poor communication leads someone to indicate that they think you’re being a bitch, the poor communicator (here: you) is 100% at fault for this situation and responsible for correcting it. Unless your bf can read your mind (can he?!), the only information he has about your feelings and desires is *what you tell him.* 

90+% of relationship problems are purely the result of shitty communication (from both sides, everyone sucks) — you’ll save yourself *a lifetime* of grief and needless drama if you learn to communicate effectively.

The truth is if they would have stayed, one of them would have started in game 2 and had some playing time in game 1. Frost could have easily said that the team needed them to stay and that there was a good chance they would see playing time if they did, which would be a much better pitch and is not a lie.

79	Well, you can't just look at the cigarette butt's on the street and just guess how long they've been there. You have to set up a proper testing environment which you will maintain for an indefinite amount of time (because you don't really know how long it will take beforehand). In this environment you will want to keep quite some cigarette butts to simulate multiple variables like, quantity of sunlight, quantity of rain, what happens in sea water, etc. Then you also have to have many of every situation as repeat testing. So you can't just put it on a shelve somewhere. You would need to find someone who is interested enough in the answer to actually fund this study, and that certainly isn't the cigarette manufacturers...	"That won't work:

- The streets are cleaned every now and then, so that messes up the data big time

80	"I’m with you. I wouldn’t exchange my playing days for anything. But my career came to an end in college when I got knocked out cold due to a massive concussion and couldn’t attend classes for about a month afterwards. Even when I did return to class the fluorescent lighting made me sick, and I suffered regular migraines for about 2 years after the fact.

I didn’t touch ice for another year after the migraines stopped. Still love to play, but it’s non-contact and honestly all the competitiveness is still there without the risk of getting seriously hurt again.

My biggest asset as a defenseman was my ability to throw my body around... I didn’t care about scoring goals, I wanted to shut the other guys down. So I never thought I’d take this stance, but ultimately I don’t think checking is necessary for the game to thrive."	"Thanks for pointing this out. Football is worse than most sports because every damn time the ball is snapped, regardless of your position, you’re making contact with someone else. Talk about repetitive head trauma.

In hockey, contact is situational.

However, I would argue that because hockey is played on ice as opposed to dirt and grass, even a proper shoulder-to-shoulder hit has more potential to seriously injure the recipient because their head is going to directly hit a surface that isn’t very forgiving. Plus, let’s not forget, there are strict boundaries (read: boards) that you can get slammed into in hockey that don’t exist in football.

81	This is exactly it.  I hate these posts that try to make it seem like the three or four potentially good starters that emerge unexpectedly each season are just going to sit there until you can grab them.  I'm in a 12-team big money league with deep benches and there is nobody available in free agency.  I went RB heavy, but I lost McKinnon, and I grabbed Lindsay with my waiver priority.  I don't need him, but he might be good and I don't want anyone else to grab him who needs the help.  Quality RBs are hard to come by, and every team in the league is going to pounce on a potential starter whether they need him or not.  The owners in my league add all the potential handcuffs and third string guys before every game just in case.  There is no way a stud RB is just going to clear waivers for one owner over and over so you can churn through them like OP says.  A strategy like the OP is suggesting might work better in a 10-team full PPR league, but even there teams are unlikely to just ignore a true waiver wire gem.	Luckily in my biggest league I went RB/RB/McKinnon/RB.  I still have a strong team, but losing my third pick sucks and now I have no bench RB in a 12 team money league with 2 RB and a flex slot.

84	"Oh wow that's very interesting! You seem to be implying that this carryforward only applies to first year losses, is this true?




*(examples going off of your original example)

**Example 1:**
Let's say that your company also posted a loss of ($100) in 2015. And then in 2016 you finally make a profit of $105. Does this mean that you have a combined carryforward from 2014 and 2015 of ($200) [($100) from 2014 + ($100) from 2015.] Which means after 2016 you would still have a carryforward of ($95) that you could use in future years.



**Example 2**
Let's say that everything happened as your original example described it. And that your company is in fact  profitable every year until the year 2020 when they post a ($100) loss. You quickly turn things around in 2021 though and make a $105 profit. Are you allowed to use your 2020 loss as a carryforward in 2021 even though your company has already been profitable for many years?"	Wow that's incredible.

93	"I'd be willing to classify most conspiracy theories as conclusions, often erroneous, drawn from little evidence, inconsistent evidence, or evidence that appears inconsistent with the observer's worldview without enough evidence to convince them otherwise. In essence, most conspiracy theories surround events that aren't or can't be well researched.

There's been enough literature to support vaccinations and discredit the autism hypothesis that I think it's now on par with Holocaust and climate change denying; an outright refusal to bother considering a massive body of evidence.

Showing a link between the two makes sense; is it a slippery slope from hypothesizing about a murky topic to a complete disbelief in science? This research shows that, for some, it is. That said, the correlation is significant but sits on the border between a small and medium correlation (~0.37 if I'm remembering correctly). Thus, conspiracy belief only accounts for approximately 14% of the variance in anti-vaccination belief. There could be a construct accounting for a much larger chunk of that pie.

tl;dr I think there are somewhat different definitions at play here that do support the reasoning behind doing the study."	"This is awesome! I'm going to do a little hijacking here to hypothesize a little at the nature of this ability.

James Gibson (1964) and Al Bregman (1982) both assert that information for perception exists in the world. We don't need to do a lot of cognitive gymnastics or rely on innate skills to interpret it; rather, we just pick up on it. The coloration and skin appearance cues rated in this study are present to different degrees in all sick people. With enough exposure to healthy humans, we can determine the regularity (or regularities) of a healthy appearance. Then, when we see sick people, we know they differ from that norm. Enough exposure to sick people can allow us to develop a regularity for sickness, as well, and perceive appearances as either ""healthy"" or ""sick"" rather than ""healthy"" and ""something's odd"".

Going out on a limb, I'd also hypothesize that gut feelings, pseudoscientific things like mother's intuition or cop's intuition, are also based in available information that is picked up by mothers and cops, respectively. They're probably using standard perceptual information, realizing it doesn't conform to the regularity of the innocent, and interpreting that as some sort of extra sense. Which, of course, it's not.

I'm 95% sure on my citation dates, but they could be 1962 and 1984, respectively. I often cite them together and they tend to get confused."	science	science	1

Why do you think that is bad?  Making people strive to be better and to be self-reflective.

What's an example?  How would potential be discouraged?  What standard are they living up to?

&gt;Additionally, religion is often hijacked by people with violent or abhorrent agendas. 

Totally agree, sometimes.  But this also happens with non-religious ideas.  There are several political ideologies that lead down this path as well.  IMO, it probably speaks more to human nature.

Fuji is probably the best bet, or a m4/3 but the image quality isnt as good for low light and he'll need to crank the shutter speed to comoensate for hand shake.

Fuji lenses are absolutely tiny and super light.

I see you have a recommendation to look at XT-2 but i think thats too much. I recommend looking at something like an XE2 (given your budget) and a third party grip so it stays super light but easier to hold. Meike do one for the XE3 that's great.

I ask a question, you dismiss it. ""Your argument is wrong because you need to become more educated"" isn't an explanation of HOW my argument is wrong.

Here it is if you forgot what it looks like:

Here consider this; in the vast majority of cases, for the vast majority of the time, people dreaming are fully convinced that they are awake and living and not asleep. But, if you were to ask how I know I am awake now, I would reply that ""I feel awake"". But this presents a problem because, as we've shown we can not trust our instinct that we are awake, because most of us feel the same way most of the time while we are dreaming. How do you know that you are awake?

I've seen people in my games calling him OP, but I don't think he is at the moment, the lack of health and lower than average damage (for a burst assassin) is gating his ass pretty good."	"I think your way is wrong. First of all, your tanky items cost a lot, and you get way reduced value from the fact you don't get any bonus health. All it means is you're basically a budget Thresh, with less supportive skills.
And your ""huge armor/mr pool"" doesn't mean much since you don't have a huge health pool to compliment it. Any ADC or Assassin building tank would get better return value than you for the items you buy, simply because you never get any bonus health. It's only math, nothing subjective there, so in my opinion building tanky you just gimp yourself : no matter what you won't get tanky enough to front line, and you won't have the damage to be a threat save for your execute.

So that's why I'd much rather go with items that Pyke can use fully, and utilize his mobility and self-peel to survive rather than brute forcing it. Again, you're an assassin, with a disruptive and bursty kit, and your job is to blow up Fighters and/or ADCs before they can take your own priority targets down (not to mention you as an assassin can become a priority target yourself). If you want full ADC peeling, or tankyness, there are way better supports than Pyke at this.

/u/alohadave has suggested an excellent lens that would do the job and be a good all rounder in the 17-50. Don't forget stitching as an option to get an ultrawide field of view from less wide lenses - this can work well in the right conditions.

And it can be tricky to use an ultrawide lens and takes time to learn how to get the best out of them. But I feel the drama and fun of an ultrawide are so worth it.

Don't forget Nikon now have a good value 10-20mm themselves - [brand new for $306 and it has VR](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1341603-REG/nikon_20067_af_p_dx_nikkor_10_20mm.html)."	"Thanks! Generally these old telephotos end up cheap because they aren't that great optically. Plus manual focus can be a hassle for moving subjects, there's no image stabilisation etc. You might find some individual reviews that will prove otherwise. You can always try a few shots out next time you have film in the camera. 

You could adapt the Nikon mount lenses to use on a Canon DSLR camera with a cheap adaptor ([this is probably OK](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Mount-Adapter-Nikon-Camera/dp/B01HGDFQAM/) but there's probably something similar for less). However, it's full manual everything and if you're doing it to use those two lenses it might not really be worth it. The 70-210mm could be a respectable portrait lens if you don't have anything else handy :)

One thing to note concerns shutter speeds with telephoto lenses. You'll notice how the tiniest jiggle in your hands is visible through the viewfinder. To stop that from impacting your photos, you need to either put the camera on a tripod, or use a fairly fast shutter speed (even for subjects that are holding still). The old rule of thumb is to use a shutter speed that's the reciprocal of your lens's focal length (on a 35mm camera).... meaning with the 500mm lens, you want a shutter speed of at least 1/500th of a second. Or with the 300mm you want at least 1/300th of a second... 1/200th of a second at 200mm and so on.

The Minolta lenses aren't as easily adapted to a Canon DSLR. You need to use an adaptor with a glass correcting element that does a bit of a number on image quality, and slows the lens down further. So I'd leave them for film only. Mirrorless cameras make adapting lenses a lot easier :)

Anyway the Minolta SRT MC-2 with the 50mm should be a lot of fun and is cheap at $50 by itself!

It's funny that you think institutions that were granted monopoly by letters patents operate in a free market during feudalism"	"Mate, look up their annual revenue and compare it to the global market for all the products and services they touch. It's less than 20%.

There is no such thing as an incomplete monopoly, that's one of the most moronic things I've ever heard. I'm not attempting to define monopoly, you don't seem to understand that. Since you brought it up, dictionary.com defines monopoly as:

&gt;exclusive control of a commodity or service in a particular market, or a control that makes possible the manipulation of prices.

Which is exactly how I define it.

The point I am making, is that obtaining and maintaining that exclusive control and ability to manipulate prices *requires* government intervention. It is literally not possible for it to happen otherwise, because competition will always arise to meet lucrative opportunity unless it is forcibly prohibited by a state actor, that's natural and economic law. 

Obtaining exclusive control by government intervention is not a defining characteristic of a monopoly. A monopoly is not defined as ""exclusive control of a commodity or service in a particular market because the government intervened on their behalf"", that is in no way what I've attempted to say at any point throughout this. It is a defining characteristic of the only environment in which monopolies can persist. Since it's obvious I have to spell it out for you. I at no point said, ""In order for a market participator to be considered a monopoly, it has to have the government intervene on its behalf."" What I did say was, ""Unless the government intervenes on behalf of a market participator, that participator will not be capable of becoming and persisting as a monopoly."" An entity with exclusive control will not maintain exclusive control unless it is capable of forcibly preventing new competitors, innovation, and market disruption. That's just a fact of life, history, and economic theory."	Economics	Economics	1

This is not even close to being the main support of his argument.  And also, it does not imply that men are small, petty, and insecure if they desire to see men and women humble themselves before God and live out their callings in life biblically.

If anyone is actually interested in understanding Piper's view on this subject, his book is available for free download:

https://www.desiringgod.org/books/recovering-biblical-manhood-and-womanhood"	"Stephen Hawking indeed was a brilliant, accomplished man.  However, if you believe what he believed, that there is no God, then everything he ever accomplished was, in an ULTIMATE sense, meaningless.  He believed that you pass out of existence when you die, and that there is no God.  Therefore, eventually, when the universe dies out (heat death or the ""big rip""), none of his accomplishments will have any meaning.  They will all be for nothing, and there will virtually be nothing, just cold, unthinking dead stars and frozen planets, or perhaps the undoing of all matter, if the Big Rip theory is correct.  Really, if you work backwards with an atheistic worldview, there isn't anything right now either.  We may as well be dead matter that happens to be in a state of higher energy, with more material interactions taking place.  There is really no more life now then there would be after the heat death of the universe.  So, Mr. Hawking's entire worldview completely undermines the value of any life at present, and even undoes the entire meaning of life as we know it.

Now, Mr. Hawking was not philosophically consistent.  Here is what he said in an interview with The Guardian in 2011:

*Q: You've said there is no reason to invoke God to light the blue touchpaper. Is our existence all down to luck?*

*A: Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing. It is a matter of chance which we are in.*

*Q: So here we are. What should we do?*

*A: We should seek the greatest value of our action.*

So, Hawking says we should seek the greatest value of our action. However, his worldview undermines any basis for ultimate value or meaning. (note ""ultimate"" is a very important qualifier here - don't get tripped up)  He is not able to live consistently in his worldview, because he knows deep down that there is ultimate value in the universe, and he lived his life in pursuit of that ultimate value.

The value that Stephen Hawking pursued, though noble seeming, and indeed beneficial to the human race in many ways, was in the end also ""perishable"".  His crown of glory will perish, regardless of whether you hold the athiestic worldview or the Christian worldview.

*""1 Corinthians 9:24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. 25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.""*

So let Stephen Hawking's accomplishments and striving after perishable meaning and glory be a ""pointer"" for you, not an end to emulate.  He knew there was ultimate value, but he sought it in the wrong places.

Unfortunately, we have to face the hard truth.  Stephen Hawking rejected God and his son, Jesus Christ.  I say this frankly, and with no gladness: Stephen Hawking is not having a heart to heart with his creator at the moment.  He will not receive a glorified, resurrected body on the day that Christ returns in power.  He rejected God in this life, and he will not spend eternity with his creator.  This is the sad reality.  Let be a warning to everyone who has ears to hear.  The greatest accomplishments on earth will mean nothing on the day that we stand before God in judgement.  All that matters is this: did you receive and love the savior that God sent into the world - his own son Jesus Christ?"	Christianity	Christianity	1

I believe in several powers higher than myself, but I don’t consider them anything akin to a god. 

I love climbing, so I’m kind of a mountain enthusiast, and I know something much greater than myself must have created the Sierra Nevadas or the Grand Teton mountain ranges. 

As an Atheist, I do have moments of spirituality, but not in the sense of some ethereal being within me. But rather just in the essence of what it is to be human, and to have the opportunity to stare up at the night sky and count the stars, or to be able to wake up in the morning and kiss the woman I love, or have two cats that I’ve created an unspoken bond with.

I have all of these amazing things that, when I put into perspective, I am humbled and grateful for. But having something to be grateful for doesn’t require **someone** to be grateful toward. 

The force that created the Sierra Nevadas and Grand Teton mountains is called plate tectonics. 
The stars in the sky are the result of gravitational attraction. 
And the woman I can roll over and kiss right now was caused by evolution and reproduction. 

All of these things are powers beyond my control, and so much greater than myself. But they aren’t beyond my understanding or beyond natural world. And the great miracle of nature is that there are no miracles. 
There are no suspensions of its natural order in order to appease anyone. 

So to answer your question, no. I don’t ever still feel that god exists. 
I sometimes wonder, but then I realize that the universe is so much more amazing in its consistency without the need to insert something to explain what I should just be humble enough to admit I don’t understand. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1
166	"This is the part about this whole thing that pisses me off the most. Thousands and thousands of people flooding the streets for their “protests” holding up signs with their little cartoons and their puns and their ‘Impeach Trump’ slogans. 

But we never hear a single thing about anyone doing anything towards *actually* changing something. Impeaching the president is possible. It’s possible to put an end to this. But instead, people want to skip school and work to walk around with their buddies, taking Instagram pictures and coming up with creative hashtags. 

If I was Trump, I wouldn’t be worried either. "	"The point I was trying to say was not that these protesters should stop. Yes, they’re trying and they have my respect for putting together a thought and a plan. That’s awesome. 

The point where I start to scratch my head and think “wtf are they doing?” is when it’s blatantly obvious to me that these protests aren’t producing the results that are desired, yet the actions aren’t being changed...or even worse, they actually *do* stop. 

At the end of the day, in 2018, gathering in front of the White House with signs won’t do shit. Vandalizing Trump’s Celebrity Star won’t do shit. 

What happened to all those huge marches in New York, Chicago, LA, etc? Were those going on for two weeks, and then never again?

A huge issue with this debate going on right now is that *both* sides are also guilty of what they’re accusing the other of doing. Hell, the fact that there’s this idea of Right vs. Left is a huge contributor to the tension going on. Everyone has an opinion as to what can be improved. Everyone has a stance on issues. There’s no “textbook” democrat or “textbook” republican and it’s impossible to get 100% of everyone on one side to agree on 100% of the opinions. 

I’m digressing. If the tactics that are being used aren’t working, or aren’t enough, then the healthy step would be to try harder. Research. Go to the people who *know* what to do. If laymen and laywomen only follow each other and go to where everyone else is going, nothing’s going to get done. It’s textbook mob mentality. No one does anything because everyone’s waiting for someone else to do something. 

Right now, on the big picture, we just have what is perceived to be two sides just yelling at each other, and then not-shutting-the-fuck-up-for-two-seconds to hear what the other “side” has to say. If you can’t have a debate without leaving with a different point of view, then you’ve failed to do your part. 

When two sides fail to just stfu and hear the “yeah but”’s of the other side, then all you end up with is an amplification of what either side has collectively agreed to be the loudest (not necessarily the most correct) opinion or stance, and then that’s where you get to where we are now where both sides are operating on these simplified views where “the right doesn’t care about human rights and is only interested in taking more money from minorities because all people on the right are rich white people” and “the left only cares about feelings and accepting everyone and giving everyone all the free stuff because everyone on the left is a poor minority who just wants their feelings validated”

And then you have a stalemate. Because then you have people slowly coming out of the woodworks who *do* try and speak up against the major narrative and say “well okay guys but hear me out...”

And then boom, the rest of the group deem them traitors and ostracize them because they stopped chanting along.

In 2010 it wasn't really an issue, because the USA wasn't on the road to becoming a neo-fascist one party state. Though of course Jones is not individually responsible for the path of the nation, his platform on the internet helps distort and mislead leaving the wider public less able to see truth.

I agree wholly that censorship of peoples sincere views is unacceptable, but Jones's attorneys have defended his content in the past by saying it was all just made up and not meant to be seen as serious.

I'm not saying deplatforming him is even a solution, but his content is an aspect of a wider trend which deprives people of access to objectivity and helps pave the way for corruption and kleptocracy; done in such a way as to *not* be an honest representation of the man's views."

The whole system is corrupt from the top down: there is no chance that any pope in the last century hasn't known about the extent of this.

From the 1950s onward there was a Catholic boys' [orphanage in eastern Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cashel_Orphanage) that was investigated by the RCMP in the mid 1970s: the whole thing was murmured about but was generally hushed up by the church and didn't become public knowledge until 1989. In an act of extraordinary bravery, some men came forward and said they'd been raped by priests and staff who used the orphanage as a brothel. They got the orphanage shut down and the church had to pay them a settlement, though of course it tried to weasel out: as the Wikipedia article notes, ""leaders of the Christian Brothers at the Vatican conspired to transfer ownership of the order's assets out of Canada to prevent court-ordered liquidation to pay compensation to sexual and physical abuse victims.""

It's always, always about money."	"Celibacy doesn't mean what you think it means. The French word for ""single"" is ""celebitaire"", same root, and it has nothing to do with who do you or don't have sex with: you can be unmarried and boning everybody in sight, or not. ""Celibate"" means ""being in an unmarried state: voluntarily abstaining from marriage"", not ""abstaining from sex"".

Because the Catholic church says that premarital and extramarital sex are absolutely verboten under all circumstances, it stands to reason that if you're not married, you're not having sex, and so the two ideas became conflated, and ""celibate"" came to mean, to many people, not having sex. But what people are supposed to do and what they actually do are rarely the same thing. Priests have had an active sex life since the very inception of the Catholic church.

She needs to know what you're going through and what you want.

She is a huge factor in this and it is important that she cooperate if you want to divorce her smoothly. Telling her let's her figure her shit out in advance. If you want her out, she needs to start packing. She needs to know before she can start packing.

Tell her you would like her name off the lease. If you are merciful, you'll let her stay if she agrees. "	"She could start taking out loans. Being in school with loans will be better for her than being sent back.

The thing is, you have no money either. You have no money, no sanity left, and too much compassion. You cannot keep housing her. Especially if you need this to file the divorce. You say you are not a monster and won't kick her out BUT months of free rent, utilities, etc. Is a LOT to give someone. You're a saint if you do this - no, you're a martyr. You're sacrificing a LOT to do this.

Does staying in a separate bedroom under the same roof count as living separate? Research the laws in your area.

How long is the lease? Can you get your name or hers off it? If you can get hers off it, do so ASAP. You can help her find a temp place to stay, a couch/closet that's really cheap and offer to loan her money. With written contract. Speak to your landlord and discuss your issues. See if you could get them to be on board. They can rescind the lease and offer a new one with only one person's name on it. Your lease agreement is your proof of where you're staying for the next while so the names on it are important.

Otherwise, I suggest you find a new place to rent ASAP. If your friends wont let you live somewhere rent-free, maybe rent out a couch and a corner of their fridge. Before the lease is up, try to stay away from her as much as possible. Spend time at a cafe or library, etc. Cut off things you dont need at the place (cable, internet if you're going to be gone all day at a library or cafe) to save money. And then sleep on the couch. Remember that by doing this, you're essentially freely handing her the amount of rent for however much time your lease is. That's a lot to give. Don't incredibly recommend this if you can avoid it.

If you have accounts she has access to, I would consider freezing them. Remove your name from anything you don't want to be responsible for."	relationship_advice	relationship_advice	1

I appreciate the book, but my point is that people can have opinions about any matter, whether they matter or not can be determined sure, but telling someone that they should jump off a cliff because maybe they think an unborn child is a life is a little extreme.

How many people have that strength. "	"Unfortunately no. Sora Yori feels more tightly-directed and focused.

My favourite phrase was 'That which is dreamed cannot be attained, but work at it day by day and one day you will find it in your hands.'

LWA also completely lacks the camaraderie and sense of belonging Sora Yori has in spades, as Akko always takes centre-stage to the detriment of the other cast."	anime	anime	1
193	"In EVE, it's definitely for money making first and foremost, and gameplay takes second seat.


Firstly, you can only train one character per account (unless you pay extra, of course!), you also train in real time, so the amount you play or the quality of your gameplay (player skill) has no effect on your training speed. What does have the effect is consummables like implants (which can be bought with real money, AND which are destroyed if you get podded, forcing you to purchase more). Lately they also added skill injectors, but I'm not certain how those worked, I haven't played in years. 


Further, the core game loop is centered around getting the player to pay more and ""play with themselves"" rather than play with others, which is EVE's major flaw. Say you're going through null, carrying valuables. Ideally, you would have a scout. Someone jumping just ahead of you, and if there's a gate camp or some other unpleasantness, it'll be the scout that gets popped, not you. However, if scout is another player, there's many conditions: the player has to be online, it has to be someone you trust (not just a random you met in chat), they have to be physically present in the same area of space (EVE has no fast travel, for most intents and purposes, outside of jump clones and bridges), they have to be willing to babysit you for the trip, etc., etc., etc. It is much faster, easier and more reliable to just have your own alt play the scout. Ah, but CCP (EVE's devs) don't allow multiple *non-paid* accounts to be logged in at the same time. Meaning you can't even use an F2P account char to scout for your main paid account. But if you pay double? No problemo, you can scout ahead. And, obviously, if it's your own account, those conditions are met automatically - you're online, you trust yourself, and so on. So instead of playing with *another person* in an MMO, you are strongly incentivized by the devs (and their design) to play with yourself instead, *and* pay them double by doing it. 


And this is scouting, the simplest example of inter-player cooperation. But this system can be extended. Same person can run half a dozen accounts for a mining fleet, or a number of other activities. And pay, pay, pay. 


In short, EVE is built from the ground up to get you to pay as much as humanly possible. And while there's technically a way to F2P it now, it's not the ""F2P"" as we know it, it's closer to WoW's ""fist 20 levels are free"". If you want to use a CovOps cloak, for example, you have to pay. And even if you earn enough in-game currency, ISK, to pay a player for a PLEX (30 days' game time), CCP still gets their pound of flesh, it's unavoidable. It may not be you that fronts real life cash, but *someone* pays. Always. 


And, because of this, EVE is painfully Pay2Win. These predatory design choices and practices, coupled with the fully player driven economy, means money talks.


A good counter-example would be Elder Scrolls Online, which is blooming right now. The game is B2P, without a mandatory monthly sub, unlike both WoW and EVE. There IS a subscription, which grants you access to all DLCs, except for big annual expansions, and some other goodies, but doesn't make you any stronger. It makes its money from cosmetics, which are...cosmetic. Meaning they have no effect on actual gameplay, character strength, etc. Arguably there's very minor effect, as they sell some consummables, but it's not palpable. Some things can be bought, and player economy is vibrant enough, but the truly worthwhile things cannot be bought, they're earned. And the game goes extra distance to make you play with others, rather than by yourself, or with yourself via your own alts like EVE. The game has its own problems, but it's difficult to make a cogent argument for ESO  being P2W.


I guess what I'm saying is that EVE is, by design, greedy and predatory. Whereas ESO is kind and forgiving. And WoW falls somewhere between the two. "	Eh. An additional character slot in Elder Scrolls Online is $15. Though to be fair you start at 8 included with base game.	Games	Games	1

197	"She didn't give a shit about the common people. You could see it in her. She gave typical non-answers during debates, blamed all of her problems on others, and wasn't anywhere near as progressive as Bernie (which is what I personally was looking for). She seemed to, or maybe this was just her supporters, build up the steam of ""well she's a woman, so there's that"". She absolutely was in the pocket of corporations and probably would've led us down the same path of armed conflicts as Trump. She was the establishment in a time when people hated the word. She didn't want to release her transcripts of speeches to bankers, and was quoted as saying that 2 faces are need for politics, and that seemed too shady for my taste.   

And I hated the ""lesser of 2 evils"" type of argument, I'm not even sure who started it. I personally didn't vote at all, so I can't complain too much about the current administration but I couldn't bring myself to vote for her. She seemed to walk around with a sense of entitlement that I just didn't care for, among the other things I've mentioned.

I hated the argument that she was the lesser of 2 evils because that's not how the presidency should be won. That's not how the American people should have to choose.

So it's the republican establishment's fault I dislike the establishment? When did the republican or Russian narrative against her start exactly? Because I disliked her from the moment I heard what she had to say in the primaries. And the way the DNC bent over backwards for her while sidelining Bernie was suspicious and didn't endear her to me. I didn't say anything about ""but her emails"" or the Benghazi stuff which I would say is the biggest ""propaganda against her"". I didn't like her because she was a typical politician that would say whatever she had to whenever and to whoever. Bernie was a far better candidate and that's why I disliked her. People can have their own opinions that are different from yours, all on their own. Not every dissenting person is a product souly of propaganda.

With the majority of the major 2018 flagships having been announced or released, and with the recent Pixel 3 leaks, I thought it would be time to share what my Perfect Pixel 3 would be. Although, the actual Pixel 3 is high unlikely to be like this.

## Display:
- 5.48 inch, 18:9 AMOLED display
- 10 Bit display
- Resolution: 2160x1080
- Effectively 5.0 inch, 16:9 display with additional height 
- 5.48 inch screen with small bezels should allow for comfortable one handed use
2160x1080 resolution, offers ~441ppi at 5.48 inches. A higher resolution wouldn’t be beneficial, due to increased power consumption due to voltage being applied to greater number of pixels and the GPU running at a higher frequency.
- Variable refresh rate up to 120Hz
- Pressure Sensitive Display
- Assertive Display - uses tone mapping to make elements of the display more 
visible when under intense light

In order for a device to be Daydream compliant it requires the device to have a low response time, which is not possible with an LCD display. OLEDs have the advantages of true blacks, theoretical infinite contrast and lower power consumption when displaying darker colours when  compared to LCD displays. They, however, have the disadvantages of consuming more power when displaying lighter colours, and pixel degradation/burn in caused by the organic compounds 
that make up the subpixels breaking down - this is especially notable with the blue subpixels as more energy is required for them to be at an equal brightness to the red and green subpixels; this is why pentile displays are used. Samsung’s AMOLED displays have been proven to be superior to their LG P-OLED counterparts, which is why they will be used.

If Quantum Dot LED displays are available, they will be used instead. QD-LED 
displays are similar to OLED displays but use Quantum Dots instead of organic 
compounds for the subpixels. This means that they have the the advantages of 
OLED displays, without the worry of burn in or pixel degradation, this also has 
the additional benefit of the display not having to be pentile. 

If microLED displays are available, they will be used instead. microLED displays are similar to OLED displays but use GaN (Gallium Nitride) instead of organic compounds for the subpixels. This means that they have the the advantages of OLED displays, without the worry of burn in or pixel degradation; while also offering a higher Lux/W and the additional benefit of the display not having to be pentile. 

XL Variant:

- 6.25 inch, 18:9 display using the same display technology and features
- Resolution: 2880x1440
- Effectively 5.7 inch, 16:9 display with additional height 

&amp;nbsp; 

## Camera:
Cameras are a key part of the smartphone experience. With the current Pixels, the primary rear camera hardware setup is very similar to the competition. Google’s software has allowed their current Pixels to become some of the best mobile cameras. With the next generation of Pixels, Google should try create a camera experience that is truly beyond its competitors by adopting and evolving the technology that is used by its competitors.

### Rear Facing
Tri Camera Setup

*First Camera:*

- 12.3MP (~1.7 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with 
LPDDR4X DRAM
- RGB
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Second Camera:*

- 12.3MP (1.25 micron) 1/2.9 inch 10 Bit - 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with
 LPDDR4X DRAM
- RGB
- f/2.4 aperture
- Telephoto Lens: 2x Zoom
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Third Camera:*

- 12.3MP (~1.7 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with 
LPDDR4X DRAM
- Monochrome
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

This tri camera setup allows for “optical” zoom, depth perception, ARCore support 
and better low light performance. 

- 9 RGB LED Ring Flash
- Record 720p videos at 960 fps
- Record 1080p videos at 480 fps
- Record 4K videos at 120 fps 
- Deep Trench Isolation (e.g. Samsung Isocell)
- Dual Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus 
- IR Laser Autofocus 
- Contrast Detection Autofocus
- RGBC IR Sensor (e.g. Sony Xperia XZ)
- Support for Camera2 API
- HDR+
- IR Laser Autofocus and 9 RGB LEDs will be implemented in a similar way to the 
[Meizu Pro 6](http://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9649269988/meizu1.jpg)

The resolution is kept the same as the Pixel 2, while the sensor size is slightly increased for the non zoom cameras and OIS is added, further improving the low light capabilities. These sensors are also 10 bit granting the ability for a wider colour gamut to be captured when compared to the more standard 8 bit cameras.

The main RGB 12MP and Monochrome 12MP cameras will be used in conjunction and take advantage of algorithms that replicate the behaviour of cones and rods in the human eye to improve low light performance. 

A Hybrid Autofocus system is more versatile than an autofocus system that is just passive or just active. The combination of Hybrid Autofocus System and multiple camera sensors will allow for more depth information to be captured, used in conjunction with Google’s pre-existing [algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html) will dramatically improve portrait mode capabilities. 

The RGBC IR Sensor is used to determine an accurate white balance, and the 9 RGB LED Ring flash can be used to adjust the white balance of the scene or improve general flash performance compared to the more standard two-tone LED flash.

The cameras will be positioned in the top left on the back of the phone similar to the current Pixel, the reason for this positioning is that reduces the likelihood of a finger obstructing the cameras when in use. They will have a layout similar to the [leaked LG V30 render](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DA1ZtyFXoAAwi9x.jpg), with quadrants 1,2,3 being the cameras, quadrant 4 being the IR Laser Autofocus and 
9 RGB LEDs, and the RGBC IR Sensor being in the center of them.

## SoC:
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 
or
Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9810
(whichever has a higher performance/watt)

Ideally, I would like to see Google design a SoC with a 
[RISC-V](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328561) based CPU, built on a current generation fabrication process, with performance that is competitive with the current generation of Apple A series SoCs. By designing a RISC-V CPU, Google would not need to pay licensing fees for the CPU architecture, it would also allow Google to reduce the dependence that Android devices have on ARM. The Pixel Visual Core would be able to be directly integrated into the SoC instead of being a discrete chip and could be combined with a custom designed ISP, further improving performance, reducing power consumption and reducing processing time for the camera. Google could also incorporate their TPU technology, allowing for better on device machine learning. Another possible benefit, is that Google could open source the drivers for the SoC. Obviously this isn't a task that can simply just happen, it would require Google to invest a lot in R&amp;D, as well as a team of highly skilled Engineers and Computer Scientists.

&amp;nbsp;

## RAM:

8GB LPDDR4X RAM

Having more RAM will reduce the average memory access time. This means an overall reduction in time taken to access data when traversing down the memory hierarchy. LPDDR4X consumes less power than LPDDR4.

&amp;nbsp;

## Build:

2.5d Gorilla Glass 5 screen - Less scratch resistant than other versions of 
Gorilla Glass, however it is more shatter resistant

With Google’s 2017 hardware lineup, Google has developed a unique two tone designaesthetic. The panels on the current Pixels are a point of vulnerability due to being made of glass, so they will be made of high quality plastic instead. 

7000 series Aluminium Alloy frame (anodised, sandblasted finish)  with high quality two tone plastic back. Plastic won’t shatter like glass or ceramic (both brittle materials).

IP68 Dust and Water Resistance

~20mm total vertical bezel due to the size of front facing cameras and the bezels being symmetrical. In comparison the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has a smaller front facing camera and doesn’t have front facing speakers has a total of 16.4mm vertical bezels

~4mm total horizontal bezel

- ~ 9.0mm thickness, so cameras are flush
- ~ 66.3mm 
- ~ 144.6mm
 
XL Variant:

- ~ 9.0mm thickness so cameras are flush
- ~ 75mm 
- ~ 162mm

Both models have ~83% screen to body ratio

&amp;nbsp;

## Speakers: 
2 stereo front facing speakers 

Dolby Atmos support

&amp;nbsp;

## Button and Port Placement:
Volume and Power buttons should be on opposite sides of the phone - this means that user won’t be able to mistake the power and volume buttons for each other (e.g Samsung Galaxy S/Note series, iPhone 6/7)

2 stage shutter button, placed lower down on the same side as the power button. It will be possible for this button to be remappable

3.5mm Headphone jack should be on the bottom left of the phone. Removing it with the Pixel 2 was user hostile.

USB 3.2 Type C Connector centered at the bottom of the phone.

In-display fingerprint sensor 

&amp;nbsp;

## Battery:
- 3200 mAh battery

XL Variant:

- 3900 mAh battery

&amp;nbsp;

## Storage:
256GB – high quality PCIe/NVMe NAND

ext4 file system. ext4 supports inline hardware encryption, while F2FS does not.

Only having a 256GB model differentiates the phone, also having multiple SKUs with different amounts of storage, will be more expensive.

&amp;nbsp;

## Connectivity:
- Connectivity:
- Bluetooth Version 5.0
- Wi-Fi 802.11 a/g/b/n/ac/ad/ax + WiGig + MU-MIMO
- LTE Cat. 18
- WCDMA and GSM/EDGE
- Assisted GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo, QZSS, NAVIC
- NFC
- Dual Nano Sim
- Support for 43 LTE Bands

By having Dual Nano Sim support as well as supporting as many LTE/GSM bands as possible, the device will have as few SKUs as possible and is further differentiated as a world phone.

&amp;nbsp;

## Addtional:
- Panel Self Refresh technology, reduces power consumption when the screen is idle.
- Notification RGB LED integrated into front speakers. (Sony Xperia Z2)
- Fast Charging Support via USB Power Delivery
- Qi Wireless Charging Support
- Hardware Based Encryption instead of Software Based
- Barometer
- Accelerometer
- 6 Axis Gyroscope 
- Proximity Sensor
- Dual Ambient Light Sensors on the front and back of the device
- IR Blaster
- 4 microphones
- Google Daydream support
- ARCore support
- IR LEDs to allow for gesture support (e.g. Moto X 2014)
- aptX HD lossless codec support

&amp;nbsp;

## Software:
Android + Pixel Software

&amp;nbsp;

## Price:
Pixel 3: £770 (including VAT) unlocked 

Pixel 3 XL: £850 (including VAT) unlocked 
 

&amp;nbsp;

# Aside:
It would be more interesting to see the phone run  a release version of Fuchsia OS - an OS built from the ground up, designed with the intent of running only on modern platforms - combined with a custom SoC implementation, that was designed in conjunction with the OS

## Alternate Rear Camera Take:
The best camera is always the camera that is on you.  For the vast majority of people, smartphones are their primary camera. In the past 2 years we have seen camera performance generally stagnate, with a few exceptions.  

Better software has allowed companies to push their camera to their limits,  and with machine learning algorithms being employed, improvements will be  seen as the training datasets are grown and the models are tweaked. 

Hardware, however will continue to remain a limiter on the RAW  performance of a camera. A simple way of improving a camera would be increasing the sensor size, however in the volume constraint  smartphone this presents an issue, as aperture size will have to be decreased to prevent an increase in z-axis height. 

To overcome this, some manufacturers have instead used additional camera sensors, allowing for the capture of more photons (data). These multi-camera implementations vary, with some using a lower resolution second camera to just gather depth information (arguably the least useful implementation), some use a secondary monochrome camera to improve low light performance, and others even using a secondary camera with a telephoto lens to allow for “optical” zoom. With these setups, the addition of more sensors will allow for greater RAW performance. It is important to take into account what type of use the additional camera provides

An approach that has been taken by Nokia and Huawei, is the use of a relatively larger sensor with a notably larger resolution. The increase in resolution may cause an decrease in the signal to noise ratio, presenting an issue in low light photography, however this is dealt with through the use pixel binning, where 4 adjacent pixels are essentially combined to create 1 larger pixel. The higher resolution is advantageous in well-lit conditions as it allows for cropping (providing a useful digital zoom). Compared to the use of a telephoto camera, this allows for a greater level of zoom, with the standard trade-off of worse low light performance, due to the smaller pixels found in these high resolution sensors.

To determine the colours in a scene, a sensor needs a method in which to distinguish between colours.  The vast majority of digital camera sensors achieve this with the [Bayer filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter) which divides each pixel into 4 subpixels Blue, Green, Green, Red.

This proposed take on a camera is inspired by the different techniques of various smartphone manufacturers.

- Record 1080p videos at 480 fps
- Record 4K videos at 120 fps 
- Deep Trench Isolation 
- Dual Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus 
- IR Laser Autofocus 
- Contrast Detection Autofocus
- RGBC IR Sensor 
- Support for Camera2 API
- HDR+
- IR Laser Autofocus and 9 RGB LEDs will be implemented in a similar way to the [Meizu Pro 6](http://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9649269988/meizu1.jpg)
 
4 larger single colour sensors are used with a resolution that is 4x greater than 12.3MP.  Single colours used are BGGR - arranged like a [Bayer filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter) - allowing for the 4 sensors combined to effectively be RGB 49.2MP (~1.7 micron) sensor. This high resolution and pixel size allows for “4x zoom” at 12.3MP in a variety of lighting conditions. Pixel binning can also be used, to effectively create a RGB 12.3MP (~3.4 micron) sensor, significantly improving low light performance. 5 axis OIS is added to each sensor improving the low light capabilities.  If used in conjunction with [Google’s HDR+ algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/10/hdr-low-light-and-high-dynamic-range.html) camera performance will even further be improved. In most situations the default resolution can be set to 49.2MP, while in extremely low light scenarios it can be automatically adjusted to 12.3MP 

A Hybrid Autofocus system is more versatile than an autofocus system that is just passive or just active. The combination of Hybrid Autofocus System and multiple camera sensors will allow for more depth information to be captured, used in conjunction with Google’s pre-existing [algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html) will dramatically improve portrait mode capabilities. 

The RGBC IR Sensor is used to determine an accurate white balance. The cameras will be positioned in the top left on the back of the phone similar to the current Pixel, the reason for this positioning is that reduces the likelihood of a finger obstructing the cameras when in use. 

## Trade-Offs:
While this proposed solution may have some benefits, it still has trade-offs, although the use of multiple sensors requires less z-axis height compared to a single large sensor, it will still take up notable volume. It will also increase the price of a smartphone. Software will also be required to ensure the images captured from each sensor are correctly aligned, which may present an issue when capturing fast moving objects.

In my experiences in a New England college where there are an overwhelming amount of socialist, progressives or even openly Marxist professors, there’s not so much focused attacks on students this way. Instead it’s offhand comments about conservatives, using popular news headlines as fodder for class (even when the class has nothing to do with politics or news), and generally using the belief they don’t subscribe to as the butt of every joke. 

I think it’s just disingenuous to do with groups of young adults who are figuring out exactly what they believe in. If you’re surrounded by 35-60 year olds who just constantly berate or joke about a view that in part creates your identity, rather than engaging in critical discussions and encouraging unbiased research on those views, it’s not a good environment. 

No one, regardless of affiliation, wants to feel like there is something wrong with them as a person for what they choose to believe in. No one wants to hear something they closely identify with used as propaganda in their class, or treated as absurd to believe in. You just silence those with opposing views by exclusion.

221	So just like Islamic values, Jewish values, and many other religions? I meant the values of loving your neighbor and the more peace spreading ones.

You're basically saying that Veggie-tales is unethical, but you can believe whatever you want. 

Christianity has changed throughout its existence. Any moderate Christian you ask today will tell you that killing your children because God told you to do so is not in line with their beliefs. Nor would they think stoning women to death is a valid punishment for sin. From what I know, some Christians even believe humans aren't valid judges for sins, and that only God can judge those who sin. I'm getting ahead of myself anyhow. Oaxis seems to be something you pay monthly and not something a kid would just stumble upon, so even if it is some super Christian platform, not many children would see it on their own. As a matter of fact, I doubt they would see a single program from Oaxis unless their parents bought access to it. If they want it to be something packaged with TV programs, I would think it'd be sold separately. I hope I'm not misunderstanding your position, but if you think parents shouldn't be allowed to teach their religion to their kids, then that's opening up a whole other can of worms I would rather not get into at the moment."	videos	videos	1

- So until last August I was living with my sister in a house.  
- A piece of mail containing her renewed license to practice her profession was delivered to my house around Jan 1 (there's a on Jan 1 from me to her telling her I got it).  
- She lives about 10-15 minutes away from my house now.  
- She has a very high stress job, is in charge of a lot of people's care, does not have much free time, and is usually really tired at night.
- We had plans on Jan 19th to see each other and she asked me a few days prior if I could bring her license with me.  I looked for it that morning for about 10 minutes before I left the house but was not able to find it.
- I let her know that I couldn't find it and I would look again.  I asked her if there was a way to have it resent.  She said there was but it would cost $30.
- Currently I am a graduate student and working part-time (roughly 30-40k) -- obviously I don't have much expendable income.
- She is working full-time and making around 100k.

Here is our text interaction after we got home from the play via text and then continuing the next morning in order to convey the two sides of the argument and emotional content (names/places/personal info has been slightly altered).  The stuff in brackets is added for clarity/context:

[THAT NIGHT AFTER WE GOT TOGETHER]

SISTER [9:49pm]:
    Any luck [finding it since you got home]?


ME [10:32pm]:
    i haven't looked yet


SISTER [10:32pm]:
    Ok well please let me know ASAP. It’s really important. And if it’s lost I’d like to talk to you about paying for the replacement. It costs $230 dollars and if I have to replace it, it’s another $30.


ME [12:25am]:
    I came home and plopped on the bed and have been catching up with [my girlfriend with whom i live now].  i will check tomorrow in the morning.  i’d be willing to pay for half if it turns out to be lost.


[THE NEXT MORNING, 8:42am]



SISTER:
Thank you. And I appreciate you being willing to pay half. I also would like to ask for the whole 30. I’ve already paid a lot of money for it and it’s not an easy process to get it renewed and this is going to add another step. Additionally just so you can understand more why I’m frustrated-This holds a lot of emotion for me. I worked very hard for that license and every year when I get it-it’s a validation that I made it through. The license is a badge of honor and a point of evidence for all the work I went though and continue to do.  I get excited every time I get a new one. And then like I mentioned-it’s expensive and an annoying process to renew (have to prove 60 Hours of continuing ed etc). I just want to tell you that bc you’ve asked me To be vulnerable with you in the past about my reactions and I’m currently feeling pretty unseen and unimportant. And I did tell you when you got it that it was important and it doesn’t feel like it was treated as important. And I do know mistakes happen



ME:

mmmm.  [sister's name] i'm really sorry!  i didn't realize you were feeling unseen and unimportant.  i know you work hard and put a lot into what you do.  and the license represents that.  you did tell me it was important but i'm not sure i was able to grasp the full scope of that from what you'd said.  i appreciate you being vulnerable with me.  i just dropped off [girlfriend's name] at [somewhere] and am heading home now where i plan to do a full search.  
    i think i do feel a bit punished by having to pay for it.  i think that's a bit hard especially because you make a lot more money than i do right now.  so it feels more severe than it would normally.  i want to contribute to helping replace it if it's lost though.  i guess from where i stand it does feel like we are both in some way responsible for this outcome too.  but i don't want you to hear me not recognizing the importance of what the license means to you.  i see and hear you in that.  i'm just not sure if me paying for it feels totally fair if i'm honest



SISTER: 

Thank you. So out of curiosity-what do you see as my responsibility in it?
    Also I’m curious about why it feels like a punishment. To me it’s honoring the relationship between two equals and owning up to having lost something of value to another. 


ME: 

i feel hesitant to express my feelings because i don't want the impact to be that you feel minimized or unseen.  i want you to know that i'm hearing and seeing you in this


ME:
    so normally in life when one moves and something important is sent to a previous address, that's a mistake that the moving person would have to rectify.  it just so happens your brother lives at your previous address.  and while i did misplace it, that first error is your responsibility.  i also told you about it three weeks ago and you didn't mention anything about it until a few days ago.  it was laying around for a couple weeks on the bookcase and at some point it must have gotten cleaned up or something.  so, i'm willing to take responsibility that i lost a piece of your mail and help you out in getting it resent.  i know that it happens to be of particular importance to you.  but that's how i see it.

For a long time, I honestly just thought my body was broken, and I beat myself up for not being able to get things right.

I wonder if even you know what this means...

Actually, no. God can't do anything by accident. It's logically impossible given the general Abrahamic concept and especially the Islamic concept. The Abrahamic concept being the one we're discussing.

&gt;The apparent lack of design and designers are evidence of that.

It's certainly not apparent to the vast majority of humanity. So, no, it's not evidence.

&gt;If you are talking about life, then mass extinctions, excessive suffering, short life spans, fatal mutations and animals eating each other just to stay alive indicate lack of design.

The studio took 2 movies, Valencia and God Particle, that they were afraid that they couldn't make money in and reshot parts of them to tie them into the Cloverfield universe. They were able to make a mint on *10 Cloverfield Lane* aka *Valencia* because the most cost nothing but now Paramount is hurting so bad that they couldn't afford to roll the dice on the $40 million *Cloverfield Paradox* aka *God Particle* film especially without any movie stars in it. They took a cash grab and sold it to Netflix and they'll probably still release the Cloverfield WW2 movie that comes out later this year.

I know what they are doing but I still find it enjoyable. They way that they have created this strange universe were all of these strange things can happen are interesting to me. The Cloverfield easter eggs are what improved both movies in my opinion.

What I watched tonight was exactly what I expected from *Cloverfield Paradox*. I'd love to see a full on Cloverfield sequel showing what happened with in New York, but I'm also enjoying this extended universe that Bad Robot seems to be creating.

As for your question, it's very hard to deal with, just keep your eyes on them and their social circle, what they're up to, how they're feeling and all that. Personally, I believe communication is KEY, talk to them, openly, about everything...don't chastise them or you will make them uncomfortable and afraid to come to you to ask for help, or tell you how they're feeling or what they're doing. Your kids need to be able to trust you, to feel that they can talk to you about anything,and it being ok. As for myself, I was raised right, my parents were kinda poor when I was younger, but I wasn't abused or neglected or raped or anything of that nature. I was just introverted and socially awkward and prone to anxiety attacks, and when I realized the drugs alleviated all of that, made me confident and outgoing and quick witted, I fell in love, HARD. Maybe had my parents asked me about it, and got involved as opposed to ignoring my drug use like they did, maybe I could have seen a doctor and been put on medication to straighten me out, instead of self medicating with Oxycontin, heroin, Xanax and whatever else I could get my hands on at the moment. Not saying that's the only situation, but mine is very similar to myriad other users I know. Talk to your kids, be involved in their life, trials and tribulations.

Nor do I think you're an asshole for bringing this to the teacher to ask that they be removed from your group. Or the principal for his terrible response. 

That said, how far off is this performance? Because, surely, you've had some inkling before now that they are not prepared? That they haven't been practicing or keeping pace with the progress of the other team members? If you've been keeping quiet and just letting them do their own thing without any encouragement or good faith attempts to get them to participate, and have been planning in the back of your mind for some time to kick them out days before the performance, that is bordering on asshole behavior.

It's not your job to babysit or force these students to do stuff. But frequently, the ""unspoken lesson"" in group projects is that it's a team building exercise, and a lesson in how to work with others (however unwilling they may be.) Open communication earlier in the term would have been key so that your teacher could guide you (or step in if warranted.) You should be prepared to answer some possibly tough questions about why you waited until now to make the teacher aware of their behavior, past the point of the teacher being able to do anything about it if they were so inclined. At the very least, there would have been some documentation that they were being little shits, and could have taken that into account when grading the group if they are more hands-off.

Maybe you really were trying to give these folks space in the hopes that they'd get it together and didn't realize until it was too late that that wouldn't happen. But you have to know going in that there is a real possibility that from the teacher's point of view, and to anyone else on the outside looking in, that it might appear that you just sat on your hands and purposely didn't do anything so that they could fall flat on their faces. And that is not in keeping with the spirit of a group project. "	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	1

The hospital I delivered at had a milk bank on site and the doctors suggested feeding her donor milk to flush out the bilirubin quicker. It was only a few bottles, but I was so grateful. Once my milk came in, I was producing more than enough for my daughter and wanted to give back so I began donating my excess. Between my two kids I’ve donated a little over 10,000oz. I was blessed with extra, so I felt there was no reason I couldn’t share. The best part was the milk bank would send out monthly emails to donor chronicling where their milk went (mostly the NICU)and the positive impact it had. Getting those emails was always the best part.	When I had my daughter in 2015 our insurance covered donor milk from the milk bank.

267	"how is present state a solution?  it took BTC from having merchant adoption to losing merchants.  how is that a plus?  the claim that it is 'like virtual gold' now, that we should just want, seems to ignore both economics and history.  gold became money because kings/governments made it so to extract taxes - just like as is done with our fiat.  it at least had intrinsic value as well.  bitcoin has neither of these going for it, and if it came out as a store of value, it would have gone absolutely nowhere.

i don't understand why lightning wasn't simply done in parallel with changing the blocksize and allowing bitcoin to chooch along as it had been.  it's current state has been crappy for adoption, and news articles have gone from new merchants accepting it to simply being about it's price, attracting FOMO bubble speculators and not what a currency needs - people who actually transact in it.

lightning seems to have significant technical challenges.  so actual adoption seems put on hold to put 100% faith in something that seems really quite fragile and unready for prime time with significant challenges.  BCH may certainly have challenges in the future but it looks like BTC shot itself in the foot."	"but where was it wrong to expect this to keep on chain solutions cheaper and allow bitcoin continued on chain growth, while this could still be worked on in the side for the future?

lightning has taken a long time and is there any real question that the current choices have resulted in the loss of merchants and market adoption?

is this not also a claim and full faith on what lightning will do *someday* vs. what it actually is capable of?  it's not that i don't think LN *sounds* good, it's that BTC made a choice that essentially felt like ""hold off everybody"" and ""lightning will save us"" - with LN making a bunch of promises that are technically challenging, and looks like they may very well go unfulfilled.

Yes, you can take the stance of ""Don't let perfect be the enemy of good,"" but this doesn't solve the problem. It just forces you to constantly grapple with whether or not something is justified. So it is just goalpost shifting. What are we supposed to measure exactly to come up with this utilitarian balancing legislation? When should it be allowable to make people suffer merely because of their membership in some group and not because their extra burden is actually deserved?

But it is easy if you just stop at the beginning and say it is not acceptable that people suffer when it is undeserved just because it is easier for society than determining who deserves the extra burden."	"You solve this problem by forbidding discrimination. That is to say, you legislate that correlation is not enough, distinction of cost requires causation.

Being male vs. female isn't the issue. For whatever reason, being male is correlated with certain behaviors that are also correlated with a higher likelihood of being involved in an accident \(I won't comment on what those might be\).  The men that do not behave in those manners will have the lower accident rates but will be the ones subsidizing the accident prone men. If a company cannot prove that the factor is causal \(male vs female in this case\), they should not be able to use it as a predictor, it is discrimination by definition without proof of causation."	programming	programming	1

Not only does this group together System Shock with those other games despite it being a rather different game, but it makes no sense. System Shock wasn't made because of the popularity of Doom. System Shock was made as basically a sci-fi take on Ultima Underworld by the same developers, and Ultima Underworld came out before even Wolfenstein 3D, predating the popularity boom of Doom clones.

272	I actually think ambien is a great Med if you can trust the patient. In guys it has very few side effects, and works well. It’s just that like any sleep Med, it can be abused or cause dependence 	"Obligatory ""This actually happened several years ago"".

So I'm a medical student and a few years ago, I was studying for STEP 1 (the first part of our medical board exams). Basically, I was studying every day for 12-14 hours at a shot - doesn't that sound like fun! - I would typically wake up around 6:00, go to a local coffee shop with a friend, and then study there till 8 or 10pm. It was a simpler time, full of stress, coffee, and ridiculous amounts of computer time doing practice questions with short reddit/imgur breaks to attempt to maintain my sanity.


Anyway, I had been taking extended release Ritalin for a few years by then, but I had recently switched health insurance policies and the pharmacy had given me a generic prescription instead of the name brand. I had just finished my old prescription a few days ago, and my new prescription was small round red pills instead of the white cylindrical ones that I had been on. This was the beginning of my undoing.

The morning of my FU, I wake up, groggily reach over to grab my stuffed animal frog with a zipper mouth that I keep my various meds in (if you've ever watched Naruto, my drug storing frog is basically like his frog wallet - and yes, I am an adult male, don't judge me please). I pull out a pill bottle and pop a little red pill into my mouth before showering and heading to the coffee shop. On the way there, I notice that I don't really seem to feel as awake as usual but I just brush it off as being tired from studying all day every day for several months at this point. When I get there, I grab a cup of coffee, find my study buddy  and start working on practice questions. A few minutes in, I realize something is wrong because I'm reading a question about the mechanism of action of some antibiotic and I break out into uncontrollable laughter. My friend looks over at me and asks me if everything is alright, and I try to explain why the question is so funny but in my drug addled state, I still realize that something is wrong because there really isn't anything that funny about cell wall inhibitors. He gets scared that something is wrong or I'm having a nervous breakdown (to be fair, at that point, we were probably both fairly close to the breaking point just from the stress of studying). He starts asking me if everything is ok and I just sit there with this stupid grin on my face giggling. After about 10 minutes of my poor friend worriedly trying to figure out what's going on, a lightbulb goes off in my head and I realize that I may have taken the wrong little red pill. Turns out Ambien looks a lot like generic Ritalin. Way back when I started taking Ritalin, my doctor had given me a prescription for Ambien to help with insomnia that happens when you start taking stimulants. I have the gift of sleep (I can fall asleep anywhere, anytime - I'm borderline narcoleptic), so I hadn't really used it. The funny thing is, medical students really don't know much about anything that isn't on tests and until then I didn't know that taking Ambien and then not going to sleep can make you pretty high. In my case, being a lightweight in general, it made me absolutely loopy.

I ended up calling a buddy who was in pharmacy school who assured me everything would be fine and that it would wear off quickly, so I spent a couple of hours watching futurama on netflix (I love the show sober, but on Ambien, I was literally crying with laughter). It ended up costing me a few hours of studying, but I didn't internet gamble or spend all of my loan money on eBay buying nesting russian dolls so I guess it worked out in the end. When I got home, I made sure to remove the ambien pill bottle form my drug holding stuffed animal to avoid future mixups.

TLDR: I took the wrong little red pill when I woke up, ended up High AF for about 3 hours."	tifu	tifu	1

You obviously haven't read the article. The wine was served on the plane by the country's National Airline.

She was charged as a result of drinking in surely what was international airspace, not in that country's territory so sorry but no. It's a nasty place, we all know it. Not because of it's landscape which is relatively barren given the environment but as a result of its system of government and it's appalling treatment of both women and poor foreign workers, both of whom are treated in the eyes of the law as manipulable assets by a poisonous religiously dominated patriarchal madness. What we wouldn't do here is to treat the person with the appalling contempt with which she was treated but as I said, it's full of nasty corrupt west and women hating children as a result of their loathsome approach towards an intellectual world view rather than a blinkered indoctrinate religious one. Israel doesn't help because it becomes an excuse to hate all westerners in the eyes of the mosques but let's be honest Islams history of mass murder in the name of peace echoes throughout history like the endless ringing of shells of the guns of the Somme.

Wotc needs to change their printing policy sooner than later and print chase cards at rare and use the mythic slot simply for cards with flavor. Akroma at Mythic is totally fine by me. 

However, that means that the EV of a box should be better seeded at rare and that some rares should be downshifted to uncommon if their value and playability suggests that it is necessary to do so.

With the current state of ~~lottery tickets~~ booster packs, I don't even see myself wanting to spend the money to draft them. EA doesn't get away with the bullshit they pull in digital games, WotC shouldn't get away with it here. 

Wizards doesn't pay attention to the secondary market? I want proof. I want to see a 4 of 100 dollar card printed at rare. Goyf, Lili, Snapcaster all rare in one set. Then I could see a 10 dollar pricetag but then they would STILL be acknowledging the secondary market. 

Magic is a game to be played, and I can't even play certain decks without shelling out HUNDREDS of dollars on ONE playset of cards (I am looking at you Celestial Collonade).

307	In order to exploit luck, you have to be prepared to recognise it! My advice would be to start getting involved with research as soon as you can. This may seem intimidating at first, but it is actually very accessible if you start contributing to studies led by more experienced people. Along the line your own experience, knowledge, and confidence will grow, and you will start to see possibilities for new or underappreciated research. This is the moment you will feel comfortable putting your very own studies together in a team of supportive experts. This, my friend, is one of the most rewarding endeavors we fossil enthusiasts can pursue. Good luck with the voyage!	"I am part of an international team that studies *Archaeopteryx* with microtomography using synchrotron light. *Archaeopteryx* is a feathered dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Bavaria in Germany. We just [found out]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03296-8) that the cross cuts of its wing bones look remarkably like those of modern birds and interpreted this as evidence for active flight. However, we also recalled that the skeleton of *Archaeopteryx* was not equipped with the advanced flight adaptations that all present-day flying birds share. Furthermore, the recent years have uncovered evidence for various previously unrecognised aerial strategies that were adopted by early bird-like dinosaurs. This led us to the conclusion that *Archaeopteryx*, which remains among the oldest of them, must have represented one of many such evolutionary experiments of dinosaurian flight that ultimately went extinct, leaving only the flight of living birds today. Tomography in general - and synchrotron microtomography in particular - continues to unlock new possibilities for non-destructive and three-dimensional visualisation of important fossils. This promises much for the future of studying the past!

I said a few words on [Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com) and enjoyed a good talk with Dave from [Palaeocast](http://www.palaeocast.com/archaeopteryx) just now.

The bedroom coder scene, which predominantly took hold in Europe but also existed to a lesser extent in the US, led to a plethora of young programmers and game designers trying their hand at game design.

321	"I think it was a gradual process from Morrowind (arguably the series high point) to Skyrim. Oblivion sat on that razor edge between the more hardcore RPG experiences, and popular appeal. It has those slightly more in depth systems that were accessible enough for people who don't have an interest in learning what THAC0. That isn't a quality judgement mind. Accessibility definitely helped ES when it came to sales.

I think the simplification of the lore is a good example of ES turning into a simplified franchise. The books tell of stuff that sound like HP Lovecraft, while the gameplay has ideas straight out of a China Mieville novel. Oblivion is low fantasy sword &amp; sworcery, whole Skyrim is vikings with the occasional lizard or cat person.

322	A conscious decision to abstain is, imo, rarely the best call but is still valid and is still you as a citizen expressing your opinion. Being too apathetic or willfully ignorant to vote is pretty shit I think; some of the fault lies with everyone else tho for letting politics get framed as so confusing when the very notion of democracy depends on the reality that politics is simple enough for the mass of people to participate in, but the feeling of complexity keeps many away today. The worst thing though, is to have an opinion, be educated on the issues, and then give in to pressure from outsiders and voting for the exact opposite.

And that’s just not true, if weed makes you feel that panicky, intrusive anxiety, LSD may very well do the same thing. Psychedelics can be great but it’s plain stupid to say some people don’t have awful reactions to them. Ketamine isn’t introspective like mushrooms or acid, I’m not saying it isn’t at all but you don’t have the long introspective journey that some people have on mushrooms, mostly because a lot of the time Ketamine just makes you feel fucked and good, and you just kinda sit there and bliss out.

It took two years of our lives, of our youths, when we are prone to development, throw us into camps to make us stagnant in the mind, and tell us it’s all for pride, duty, honour, country, as if those can put food on the table.

If you’re gonna tell me look at the bigger picture, sure. It’s for the general population, it’s good for national defence. Almost even absolutely necessary, actually, because some people responsible at the top and drawing million dollar salaries can’t reasonably come up with a better plan.

However, you sacrifice the years of life off each and every male part of the general population who aren’t rich enough to be a white horse or go overseas, neglecting that they are individuals as well. You sacrifice years off male citizens’ lives, while many new citizens and PRs just hop on the country, get that pink IC and don’t need to serve. It’s a cancer that is biased only towards the people it’s meant to protect, and it’s a cancer that puts those same people to forcibly sacrifice themselves for the sake of others who don’t have to.

My apologies, but point is, point 2 can be re-phrased more... maturely. It’s poking a hornets’ nest with its phrasing.

And well, you do know that 2 years earlier of going into the workforce can mean a lot, right? 2 years more to put into your resume as work experience, 2 years for promotions, for exposure, and pay raise off an actual pay (not off an allowance). You can’t put Ns into your resume and expect it to do anything, unless you’re a spec or an officer.

If you’ve been really following things closely, study it, know and understand that this is a complex social issue. Figure out how society can make it such that those 2 years are worth it, or figure out how to return us 2 years of our youth, of experience, of money, of promotions, of everything, and no, not that voucher shit. Still haven’t received my ns50 vouchers til this date. It’s not enough either, given the lost potential, knowledge and brain cells due to lack of sleep, due to those 2 years.

Alice? Arisu? I'm just gonna call her Alice since that's what's actually written within the anime when her name appears on messages.

When Lain returns home, she doesn't find anyone there. Her home is lifeless. We've already seen from the first 2 episodes that her life at home feels abnormal with how distant everyone is. Something I noticed just now is that [her parents sleep in separate beds in a nearly empty room](https://i.imgur.com/MtBiRtk.png). Some of you noticed in the last episode that there seemed to be little passion in the kiss that the two had. It really gives the impression that [big spoilers](/s ""this is just a fake family."")

Lain once again displays some unusual behavior. First it's how she keeps repeating Alice's name slowly. Lain doesn't really know how to react to her classmate who is expressing worry for her. There's just something about some of her lines that feels artificial. The next strange thing about her behavior is a lot more obvious. Her personality keeps changing from shy and nervous to more confident and direct. There's apparently this ""wild"" Lain that is on the Wired enough for people to recognize her. When she went back to the club, the guy there knew her, implying she frequently went there before. When she's questioning the kids about the Psyche she obtained and Taro asked for a date, her face quickly turned hostile, far different from the reserved girl she normally is. To make things more strange, the episode ends with Lain working on upgrading her Navi. She barely had any knowledge on technology and had little interest in the Wired. Now she's directing all her attention towards it.

This was a slower episode with not a lot drama or bizarre hallucinations. But it's still necessary to help build up Lain's character and foreshadow some important plot points. There's also a certain line that seems meaningless at first but is actually funny when you look back on it. I'll link it when the right episode comes (unless another rewatcher also caught that and links it in this discussion)."	anime	anime	1
332	"None of this is correct, or fact based. 
1. “Large professional athletes are on steroids, and eating under 200g of protein/day.”
-Can you cite any of this? I know or have trained with a pretty extensive number of high level athletes. The ones competing in Olympic sports were drug tested often, and those competing in non-Olympic sports(baseball,football, etc.) I would find pretty unlikely that the majority were using PEDs. 
As far as nutrition goes, most nutritionists would provide protein recommendations based on body weight and sex of the athlete. So to say most athletes are eating less than 200g of protein a day literally means nothing. Yes, most athletes under 200lbs are eating less than 200g/day since most current science points recommends around .8g/lb body weight. And most athletes over 200lbs are eating over 200g a day.

2. “Most people will struggle to use more than 100g a day.” Again, where did you learn this? It doesn’t match with any of the current science being used by pretty much all sports nutritionists. 

3. You prove you know pretty much nothing on the subject your last statement. Anyone just blindly choosing to eat 2500 calories a day is doing themselves a huge disservice. You should be consuming calories based on your total daily expenditure and your current goals. If you want to lose fat, eat in a caloric deficit, usually around 200calories under what you’re current TDEE is. If you want to gain muscle, eat in a caloric surplus. 
An example in case you don’t follow me. Say I’m a 125lb female, working a desk job, and training 4/5 days a week. Probably expending about 15/1700 calories a day, maybe less. If this person were to eat 2500 calories a day, they would quickly add a large amount of adipose tissue, and become overweight. This is why you don’t just randomly assign calories. 

Please refrain from posting nutrition advice again, at least until you learn a little more. "	"I train with athletes in the USADA testing pool. There’s just no way without Lance Armstrong money to get away with taking PEDs. Monthly blood and urine testing, and constant supervision make it pretty hard to cheat. Yes, some people definitely do, but it is definitely the minority.

The studies done measuring nitrogen balance are usually done over very short periods( less than 4 weeks), and most of these studies are done with sedentary adults. Most long term studies done on NATURAL athletes point to the numbers I stated earlier.

If you’re looking for a good source on nutrition, without having to sift through all the research yourself, go read The Renaissance Diet by Dr Mike Isratel. He’s a former professor of nutrition at Temple University, and runs a company that does nutrition for athletes all over the world. "	Frugal	Frugal	1

It sounds like your girlfriend (and you) have some expectations about what is supposed to happen during sex, i.e. that they fuck and the guy cums, and in that moment it is the proof of all those things that validate each other, i.e. you love her, find her attractive, etc.  ""Movie sex"", basically.

There are so many reasons why it doesn't happen that way.  One thing that's common is when people get stuck in their own heads and that prevents them from cumming.  They are anxious and thinking about something else: I've got a hair in my mouth, my belly looks gross, I have a headache, did I send that email to the wrong person... stuff like that going on in your head is stopping thousands of men and women from cumming right this second, all over the world.

It can be a real headfuck though.  *Why didn't he cum, doesn't he find me attractive? Why didn't I cum, is there something wrong with me?*  There is so much pressure to perform, and then if it doesn't happen the chasm seems like it opens up below.

I have had to tap-out myself from having sex because I couldn't cum, for whatever reason.  I have also refused sex from my drunk girlfriend returning in the middle of the night - again, play that situation with the genders reversed and see how it tastes.  I think in that situation there is a lot of pressure to perform, and then to say ""You have to cum"" really piles it on.  Even someone without your history could find it hard to cum in those circumstances.  I would find it difficult, even if on another day I could be up for it.

Her being drunk probably turned this situation into an emotional firebomb, which is unfortunate.  It isn't fair on you to take all of that on board.  I know it's only alcohol but another way of looking at it is, she was high on drugs and then had a freak-out.  I would hope that she would apologise to you for putting you in that situation once she is sober, but perhaps  she needs to hear again how things are difficult for you before she can realise it isn't anything to do with her body-image etc."	sex	sex	1
337	"The word ""pilot"" originally meant a person who steered a ship; it then had the sense of ""guide"", and then ""leader"", and later ""prototype"".

Originally, a pilot episode of a TV show was a one-off, to show studio executives what the show would be like, and sometimes also to gauge audience reaction. If the pilot was a success, the whole series would be commissioned.

Not all pilots were broadcast; and sometimes pilots would be broadcast not as the first episode. For example, the first pilot of the original *Star Trek* series, called *The Cage*, was rejected, but was later re-used in the later two-parter *The Menagerie*. A second pilot was filmed, called *Where No Man Has Gone Before*, and this was accepted: however, it was broadcast as the *second* episode. This explains why the costumes look slightly different in that episode.

There are also so-called ""back-door pilots"". This can be an episode of an already successful TV show that introduces some new characters and settings, in the hope that it can be spun off into a new series -- that way, even if the pilot is not accepted, it still serves as an episode of the original show. An example of this is an episode of *The Cosby Show* that served as a back-door pilot for *A Different World*.

More often, though, a back-door pilot is made as a TV movie -- again, the idea is that even if it doesn't lead to a full series, it can still stand alone as a movie.

These days, though, producers prefer to make a shorter ""demo"" episode. Instead of risking a lot of money on a full-length episode or TV movie, a short episode introduces the characters and gives a sense of the set-up, plot and writing, with only basic sets and minimal post-production work.

However, audiences are so used to the first episode broadcast as being the pilot that people tend to always call the first episode a ""pilot"" -- even when it isn't."	Many countries have laws that Uber refuses to comply with. For example, Uber insists that its service is a rideshare service, but, for example, in Germany it fits the legal definition of a taxi service. Thus Uber has a straightforward choice: either comply with all the legal requirements all taxi services have to comply with, or don't operate in Germany. Uber has chosen the latter, it's that simple.	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1

346	"Territorial disputes, war and revolution is not an inter cultural exchange in the same sense as the LOTR.

&amp;#x200B;

The authorship of LOTR drew a great deal from events surrounding the modern world with the events leading up to, during and after the 1st world war.  Tolkien was in the Battle of the Somme.  In the various parts of China's history that Jin borrowed heavily from, there has never been a relationship with an ally like the English and the French during the 1st World War.  Likewise, there is no analogue in Jin's novels that are similar to the likes of the Humans and Elves in LOTR.

&amp;#x200B;

That's what I'm referring to, and I hope I am making my point clearer."	"No it's not.  I don't want to make that comparasion because Chinese Wuxia as an analog to Western Fantasy doesn't really fit right.  Beyond that, Tolkien's work relies extensively on his ability in world building.  Jin Yong's stuff relies heavily on his ability to appropriate different historical eras of China.  Jin doesn't have to come up with a new dialect of a new species of a human-like race, because Jin Yong's world doesn't deal with inter-cultural exchanges between races of bipeds.  He seldomly even dealt with inter cultural exchanges between Han and non Han Chinese, because those circumstances were rare in the historical eras he borrowed from.

&amp;#x200B;

The scope of comparing a writer of one culture to another, just because they both belong in this category of 'fantasy', from two cultural settings on different sides of the British Empire, written in two different languages aimed at different audiences, is lazy.  I don't need a western analog to introduce one of Hong Kong's greatest newspaper men whom was even more successful as a fiction writer.  But if one had to do it, I wouldn't have picked Tolkien as a counterpart to Jin Yong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, comparing Jin's work to Shakespeare is not like comparing him to Spielberg at all.  Shakespeare is perfectly fine as plain reading material.   Spielberg's is definitely not.  I can enjoy Cha's work on film, a television show, a stage produced musical, a comic book drawn by authors from Hong Kong (or Japan for that matter) or as a novel in its original form.  His stories defy medium.  I don't think anyone is confused by that.

That's good to hear. 

I never claimed I was it's *impossible* that there is some naturalistic explanation. I only claim that there is *no evidence* for the naturalistic explanation and *plenty of evidence* for the supernaturalistic one (John has visited people after his death, healed people during his life, there is a whole spate of incorrupt holy men and women). So the only reason for preferring to withhold judgment is a prior commitment to naturalistic explanations. That prior commitment might be true, but it's philosophical not empirical.

Best of luck in your search for truth! May god (if he exists) guide you."	"&gt;Then you'll have no trouble linking me to a scientific article on magic happening in a lab?

Your comment here opens a more important thread. 

My thesis is that miracles are more like consciousness, the external world, or morality: the evidence for them comes from observation, introspection, conversation, rather than from a lab. 

To ask for ""evidence of consciousness in a lab"" is a category error. All the behavior that consciousness is invoked to explain (speech, movement, response to stimulus) can be studied in a lab, but the hypothesis ""this being is conscious"" is a philosophical claim that must be tested within its own domain. 

Someone who denies the existence of the external world cannot be convinced with data from the lab. Heck, they can't even be convinced by hitting them with a piece of the material world. It's a philosophical claim that needs philosophical treatment. 

Someone who denies the existence of morality certainly cannot be pointed to evidence (videos!) from the lab. It requires some thinking. 

Similarly, the domain within which miracle claims must be evaluated is a philosophical and epistemological domain.  (a) what is a miracle? (b) can they possibly occur (logical possibility)? (c) if so, is there any good reason to think the world is the kind of place where the might be likely to occur? (d) if so, are there any events for which the best explanation is that it was a miracle? (forget ""only explanation"" -- all we need is ""best explanation"", the same as with consciousness. We *might* be unconscious meat machines, but it's not the best explanation.) (e) If so, then it is reasonable to conclude, on balance, that a miracle has occurred. 

And anyone who cares to can do the work of thinking through (a)-(e). 90% of the world already is aware of this stuff; the 10% who aren't can convince themselves of the truth, though it may take a year or two. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Whether it was intentionally malicious or foolhardy arrogance, it’s wrong that it happened and is still happening. I even get trying to force action, but I can’t abide by using anyone as a bargaining chip or political hostage.

So I still think term limits would be a good idea. While people and views may change over time, I don’t think it’s a great practice to give someone a more or less blank check on the future of law."	politics	politics	1

382	"For both Galactus and the Surfer, if you want to see how they started, read Fantastic Four (1961) #48-50, where they first appeared. 

The Silver Surfer’s 1968 series is crazily bombastic but often really great, too—try #4 for starters. 

Both Galactus and Doom figure prominently in John Byrne’s excellent mid-1980s run on Fantastic Four (1961): #243-262 is a nice juicy long string of storylines with both of them. Also try #350 and 352.

The two recent Silver Surfer series, 2012 followed by 2015, are pretty beautiful. The “Silver Surfer by Stan Lee &amp; Moebius” one-shot isn’t the best story but has some gorgeous art.

Galactus has a really interesting role to play in Ultimates (2015) and Ultimates 2 (2016).

For Doom, have a look at Doctor Strange &amp; Doctor Doom: Triumph &amp; Torment. 

You’re going to really dig the long Jonathan Hickman serial that runs through Fantastic Four, F.F., New Avengers, Avengers, Infinity and Secret Wars (2015), but if you’re going be doing a bunch of reading, hold off on it a little bit until you have more of a sense of Doom’s history.

Sounds like you need to do more stuff like this. In addition, you need to increase your work capacity.  This can be done through HIIT training, LISS cardio, AMRAP sets, etc. There's no one path or one magic formula.

I went on a pre-rock kick last year and it was amazing. Jazz, blues, doo wop, early pop. You get to hear all the songs Led Zeppelin and all the other 60s/70s bands covered or borrowed from. You get to hear how the blues and jazz inspired funk. Then you get to hear how funk inspired rap. Many of the sounds Kendrick Lamar uses can be traced back to music from the 40s. Maybe all of this will build into a new genre that sounds completely new but still influenced by the past. It has happened almost every generation.

388	"I would have to disagree. The last-gen version of the game was also on Xbox 360, which probably would've been less of a pain to port from than the PS3 build, and it's reasonable to assume that they'd still have the source code given that the PS3 version is still a pretty recent port.

And also a PS4 codepath for the engine already exists seeing as the remaster uses the MT Framework that Capcom has used for most of their games since 2006. A few titles which are available on PS4 using this engine include:

* Dead Rising

* Resident Evil 6

* Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

* Dragon's Dogma

* Resident Evil Revelations (and 2)

* REmaster

* Devil May Cry 4 HD

* RE Zero HD

* Monster Hunter World

So yeah, this looks like a ""path-of-least-resistance"" thing. It's cheaper / easier to upload a PS2 binary / disc image wrapped in Sony's emulator than to port the game to a new system.

But they do this because they haven't the time or resources to teach people how to properly manage it, and they probably also don't want the hassle of people blaming them if someone mis-manages their diabetes.  I have a friend who's diabetic and he eats whatever he wants.  He eats a lot more sugary stuff than I do, I amazes me when we go out somewhere, he's stuffing donuts, bread and buns into himself, and takes like 4 sugars in his coffee.

399	"The question wasn't about the fine tuning argument though???

It was about how likely abstract mathematics is to apply to the world on naturalism versus theism."	"&gt;What does this mean? I couldn't find anything relevant by googling this term.

Anti-realism: the position that there is no real objective truth about formal or mathematical truths apart from the human mind.  We created the mathematical system, and mathematical statements are true in it or not because we can prove them or not.  There is no such thing as the number 1 or addition or integrals that exist apart from the human mind.

Realism: The position that real objective truths about formal systems and mathematics do exist apart from the human mind.  1 does exist whether there are people to think about it or not, so does addition, and integration.  mathematical statements are true or false on the basis of whether they correspond to the real objective mathematical ""realm"" if you will.

Craigs short little argument that the OP is talking about says that under realism or anti-realism, the naturalist (ie. believer that there is no supernatural, only natural) has no good explanation for why their is coherence between mathematical truths and nature (whether mathematical truths are realist or anti-realist)

&gt;Depends on what you mean by structure. [A mathematical structure is a set of abstract entities with relations between them. The natural numbers under arithmetic constitute a structure, with relations such as ""is evenly divisible by"" and ""is greater than"". Here the relation ""is greater than"" includes the element (3, 4), but not the element (4, 3).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(philosophy_of_science)#Definition_of_structure)  
&gt;  
&gt;Under that definition, no. Not really. Even a ""chaos"" would still have structural relations.

Your example of greater then and evenly divisible by would still be true whether or not they were usefully applicable to the world.  Craig's challenge is for a naturalistic explanation for why those concepts should be useful for explaining the physical reality.

&gt;This kind of minimal structure cannot support self-aware intelligences, so this is solved by the anthropic principle.

So first off, Craig's not going to accept the anthropic principle and has responded to it in way more depth then he went into in this article about mathematics.

Second off, why?  What's your argument that the minimal structure cannot support self aware intelligence's? Craig believes that minds can exist independently of matter of all together.  You seem to be pre-supposing naturalism when you reject the possibility of immaterial minds, which is what Craig is arguing against.  Even if minds cannot exist without material brains, why couldn't they exist in a universe where only a minimal mathematical structure is applicable?"	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1
400	A mini Haedrig that salvages whites/blues/yellows would be a huge QOL improvement. Or even just an inventory item that we can buy that will salvage all items in our current inventory.	"Storymode:

- A story that you can actually lose. Not just by dying or something, rather a story that you can actually fail to accomplish your ultimate goal. 

- Ability to choose to side with angels/demons/humanity (Zoltun Kulle was right, change my mind)

- Not starting out as a hero/god/demigod/chosen one/etc. Just being a normal person who wants to do what they believe is good/evil. 

Mechanics/gameplay:

- A focus more on the character's strengths rather than the gear's strength (more like D1, less like D3) Not saying loot can't be unique/powerful, but the reliance on sets/specific build-enabling items/excessive power creep leaves the game pretty stale and lacking in complexity/uniqueness IMO. 

- Learning/obtaining skills should be rewarding and unique; leveling up/buying a skill/getting a skill drop shouldn't just be ""Now you have the ability to do X!"".

 There has to be a better way that makes more sense. Like defeating an angel/demon and carrying its carcass/weapons/organs to someone who can extract its power for you to harness, maybe there's some negative effects that go along with the power you gain. Maybe you can offset these effects with gear/further honing your skills with other mechanics/etc.

What was my comment pretending to be that it's actually not? I've never said that products like CoD, Twilight, and Taylor Swift are bad, it's just they have mass appeal and that's why they sell. Popcorn entertainment doesn't automatically mean bad - I was reacting to OP seemingly equating sales with quality. My point was that the best products don't always sell the most, and the products that sell the most aren't always the best.

But think about e.g. consequences of making racist jokes in the workplace nowadays. It isn't illegal (yet) to make such jokes but you are likely to put your job in jeopardy.	"Punishment always comes after the fact. You might as well say ""Does the animal being tortured feel some relief because their torturer is going to go to jail later?"" It's not a reasonable objection. Unless you want to arrest everybody who might possibly later on torture an animal (i.e. everybody), you have to accept that crimes will be committed and you won't be able to do anything about it until after it happens."

410	"The structure of a CMOS pixel is very simple.  There are most typically three transistors, a diode, and a capacitor.  The capacitor is often virtual, as all of the capacitance needed is provided by the circuitry spanning the output and diode.  You can even find this information on Wikipedia, under active pixel sensor.

For a 20 megapixel sensor, this would total less than 70M transistors, including ADCs, clock/controller, and other on-chip features.

An AMD Ryzen Threadripper processor contains about 20 billion transistors, ~300x more, in a package of similar area.  The 12nm node it is printed with is only about 1/10 the resolution of the node used for image sensors.

CMOS sensors are comparatively very easy to fabricate and have much higher defect tolerance.  A defect may cause at worst a hot pixel in a sensor, which is easily masked out and the chip is sold for full price.  A defect in a CPU results in it being binned lower with some features disabled, which may cost hundreds of dollars.

A 14nm FinFET wafer, fully processed, is worth $2,000 after dicing.  Between this 14 nm node and 120 nm, there are 22, 32, 45, 65, and 90 nm nodes.  Sensors use six full generation old steppers, the machines for which may be purchased third or even fourth hand.  The raw wafers tolerate substantial defects such as pits, surface waviness, and micro-roughness that make them insuitable for state of the art IC printing.

You may imagine that using an extremely old stepper and comparatively low quality wafers does not make for high production costs.  You can find in more recent issues of IEEE Spectrum's photonics issues that the cost of CMOS image sensor wafers, fully processed, is about $500.  A wafer fits 20 24x36mm chips.

I think you have bought into this idea that if a FF camera costs $2000+, then the sensor must be big money (e.g. $500-$1000).  This is not true.  The sensor is one of about a thousand parts that go into that $2,000 camera, which also funds 1-2 years of R&amp;D, trial production, less than perfect yield of the assembled cameras, a support network, warranty, significant cycle time in production with many human hands ($$$) involved, and marketing."	Defects would not go as the square of the area, that makes absolutely no sense.  The rate at which the machine makes an error is fixed.	photography	photography	1

I was already diagnosed at the age of six, and socially I'm extremely impaired.

And even I'm lucky compared to nonverbal autists. And you should also remember that nonverbal autists are much more representative towards ASD as a whole (as far as that's possible) than you are. 25-50% of autists are nonverbal.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3727194/

If you can make up social deficits with great intelligence, then you may not be disadvantaged compared to the average person. The problem is that most of the time autism comes with below average intelligence. Intelligent autists (intelligent people in general) are over-represented on the internet so it can quickly generate the illusion that autism is a disorder that comes with high intelligence which is simply not true.

To put it bluntly, you aren't representative for the average autist, neither am I probably. A nonverbal autist probably is.

And you can also look at it in another way, you are disadvantaged compared to someone else of equal intelligence but no symptoms of autism (or other disorder/disabilities)"	"1. It can't be genocide if it wasn't intentionally meant to destroy them.

Does the ex value both of your happiness enough that if you being together is what makes you happy he can accept it (doesn't sound likely)?

447	"I'm not saying that Arya's character is an evil killer, I'm just trying to fit GRRM's themes a bit more.

One of the big messages of the books is that revenge is a never-ending cycle of pain and violence where innocents get hurt, and that these grand acts of killing other people isn't justice, it's just vengeance.

The way Arya's killing of the Freys in the show is presented, Arya has done nothing wrong, because she only ends up killing the people directly responsible for the Red Wedding while sparing the women and children. So the audience feels after this scene that what Arya did is good, and thus that mass killings are a proper and proportional response, with no possibility of blowback.

&gt;She's not going to kill the women who were innocent. Or the Freys who were not a part of the Red Wedding slaughter.

I agree. My point is though, Arya didn't do a proper investigation of all the Freys and determine who was and who was not guilty, and then killed them individually. Arya just assumed that all the male freys were guilty and killed them all, with no trial or investigation.

If the show had shown a couple of the women drinking anyways, or had shown that a couple of the men who drank were actually innocent and had tried to stop the red wedding, or had shown a surviving Frey vow revenge against the Starks for killing his/her family members who weren't quite as guilty, then Arya's murders would be shown in the light that GRRM is trying to shine on violent revenge (that it's bad). But instead we're led to believe that Arya only killed guilty people, and spared innocent people, and thus that the blind, indiscriminate killing she did was justified.

&gt;That's why she didn't kill anyone the MFG ordered her to kill if they didn't deserve it (in the books or on the show)

She's only killed one person for the MFG in the books, and even then she didn't ever confirm that he was guilty of the crimes that the kindly man accused him of. As for Dareon, Arya killed him for deserting the Watch, but Dareon maintained that he was innocent of the crime that sent him to the wall. Did Arya really have enough knowledge to determine whether he  actually deserved to die?

The point I'm trying to make is, Arya kills a lot of people in both the show and the books, based on very quick decisions with little knowledge of the full situation. But the audience is led to believe that everything Arya has been doing is moral, and that she has the right to decide who lives and who dies, and we have never seen any consequences (either for Arya or for innocent people) of Arya's violent actions. And that flies in the face of GRRM's message that there is little to no justice in war and violence, and that revenge begets revenge."

There's a web site someone could probably direct you to, but when I used to do it years ago, you would get a GPS location and a rating of difficulty then go out in the middle of nowhere and look around until you found a container with little trinkets in it then trade some little things and write it down in the tiny book at the location.

**Best:**

[SNS Herning Zoom Cardigan](https://www.eastdane.com/zoom-cardigan-sns-herning/vp/v=1/1575576656.htm) - absolutely obsessed with this, completely changed my attitude towards sweaters. I’m all in on cable knits now.

[Engineered Garments black CPO shirt](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/cc/89/96cc89f1d228b69a7beb5cb0599bc4b1.jpg) - got this as my score of the year at Beacon’s Closet, my first EG piece and I'm obsessed

[Strategic Business Unit suede zip-up boots](https://traitor-newyork.squarespace.com/mens-shoes/sbu-mens-boots-black-suede-italian-zipper) - picked them up used at Beacon’s Closet. I'd wanted a pair of zip-up boots for a long time and absolutely love these.

[Uniqlo Ines de la Fressange jacquard sweater](http://www.uniqlo.com/sg/store/men-idlf-jacquard-crew-neck-long-sleeve-sweater-4016810003.html) - this has been a go-to this winter, tons of compliments, glad I picked this up instead of a possibly questionable Uniqlo cashmere sweater.

Everything I bought from [Boot Boyz Biz](https://shop.boot-boyz.biz), the only ""streetwear""-adjacent label I care to follow.

**Worst:**

[A Day’s March flannel shirt](https://adaysmarch.com/product/soft-flannel-shirt-custom-fit-button-down/?attribute_color=Navy&amp;attribute_size=S) - splurged on this when I was in Stockholm this summer but it shrank a little bit (and I gained weight, a bad combo) and the material is a little fussy. Hoping to try this out within the next couple of months with different fits. 

[Fred Perry x Raf Simons polo](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ab/46/94/ab46948eaf5de11ac05c5420a4bd673c.jpg) - got it off eBay for $21, a legit score, but it’s way too small. I’m an M in every FP piece I have, but it fits like an XS.

[Uniqlo U button-down](https://www.uniqlo.com/UniqloUss/common/images/items/item_197629_17.jpg) - impulse buy on clearance, could never figure out how to style it."

451	Yea, and cool for people that want to live like that, but I certainly don't. I hate being in the middle of a busy city! If anything I'm pretty sure your suggestion would RAISE the cost of actual houses, making less available and more rentals available will attract more people with money looking to live in the middle of the city and push homeowners that like the area and want to stay out. If someone is buying a house they are committed to the area, if someone is just renting an apartment or condo they don't have the same attitude.

he could have sent the “you’re beautiful,...” paragraph as the first message and followed it with, “and a 10/10 to me.” and moved forward romantically, but instead failed to read the situation and express himself initially, said some dumb shit, and had to double back. now he’s salty he got rejected. beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that.

Unless as in the case of Black Panther and presumably future films a user review contains hate speech, it remains “legitimate” and contributes to the percentage rating regardless of its content. 

If people then choose to look at the score, decide there’s a trend or decide there’s some mass agenda being pursued, then you end up with a whole other debate as to whether their observations are valid or not. 

If you think TLJ’s score is 100% legitimate and representative, that’s your right - others would agree with you, others might disagree.

Oh, and I was the one being insulting? Nevermind me working long hours to pay my way through college. Nevermind the HUNDREDS of hours studying for exams, nevermind all the pain and struggle I endured to come out successfully. It was all luck, after all.

In 1970, around 60% of the world’s 3.7 billion people lived in extreme poverty. Today, only 0.7 billion of the world’s 7.5 billion people live in extreme poverty. That’s less than 10% of the world’s population. Driven by capitalism.

&gt;Income inequality IS stealing from the poor and giving to the rich

No it's not. They created a product, you bought it. Nobody forces you to give money to the rich.

&gt;If you have 15 (hypothetical) cookies that will feed the world forever, but 7 of 400 million people take 14 of them leaving everyone else to split 1 — What now?

Throwing money at a problem doesn't solve the problem. This has been demonstrated countless times with school systems, foreign aid, etc. There are core fundamental problems with why people are poor and stay poor. ALSO, they didn't steal the 14 cookies. They created them. They CREATE wealth and value when the innovate and push technology further. Making an extra cookie doesn't take one from somebody else.

If what EE said in the interview is true, then fnatic tried to do the ""best"" thing for everyone and not just one entity. Yes, the situation sucks for Ohaiyo, but despite of the kick (which would have happened anyway), there was no real damage done to Ohaiyo for not letting him know about the situation before they qualified. Making this decision was however better for the organization as well as each individual player. So if you're a fan of Abed or DJ you should also think about them as they might have not qualified if they had used Universe after his 24h flight with jetlag etc. The situation could've been handled much much worse, i.e. by letting Ohaiyo play the remaining qualifiers as well and THEN kick him.

We do have evidence dozens of philosophical arguments of his existence including Kalam, the argument from motion, contingency argument, ontological argument, etc. Which one do you want to discuss?

How do historical arguments translate into proof of existence? There are extensive arguments for the God of Thor by The Vikings but they are no longer around. The Greeks have arguments for their God of Zeus, but we know that God is not to be true."	"I'm not denying any essence of the human. Not at all. I'm providing a truthful explanation of why we feel love as you previously said, love, is something we received from God. However, if love is, in fact, a chemical that has been proven to be as such, scientists can safely say that love is merely an evolutionary adaptation that humans have acquired. With that being said, the principles of what is real and what is not real, become apparent when you talk about love.

Here is a question for you that I challenge you to explain to me. Mother Gorillas have been observed to have morality driven actions and thoughts towards their young. How can an animal (as classified by humans) show compassion or morality for their young if they do not worship a God? This notion makes it apparent, that humans have evolved to make up such a fantasy as Religion."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

There are a number of apps, both for iOS and Android, that act as a DSLR remote plus monitor over USB or WiFi. I have a shoe mount to hold my phone and it uses a ball head so I can change it's position any way I need. 

The app I like best, but isn't free, is qDSLRDashboard (I think their PC software is free if you want to experiment with that first). Otherwise, for Android, you can try DSLR Controller. "	"Honestly, I don't think editing on a tablet with Snapseed would be your best option. Snapseed is fine for mobile photos, but it lacks noise reduction and the RAW editing tools are fairly poor IMO. 

Don't get me wrong, Snapseed is my favorite editor to use on my pics snapped from my phone, but mostly out of convenience. 

I'd look into upgrading the laptop and trying a different application for photo editing. 

If you must use a tablet for photo editing, explore other apps out there. I'd at least consider Lightroom mobile for your DSLR pics -- it's free (at least on Android it is), you just don't have some features unless you subscribe to CC. On Android, I like Photo Mate R3, but I don't think it's available on iOS. It's a pretty fully-featured RAW editor but still edits jpeg. 

Before you choose a tablet, explore the editing apps available on that platform and consider their cost too. Apple (not my favorite either due to ecosystem) is pretty reliable and holds better standards for app development it seems. Android means sifting through more crapware to find something good.

497	"Pretty hard to avoid day-long back and forths when such a broad topic is involved, you're right. I'd like your take on the problem with God's behavior in Genesis, specifically when dealing with Adam and Eve. Explain God's foreknowledge of our species' future (a natural result of his omniscience) and his subsequent choice to place us in a position where we are, by the way we are made, vulnerable to his arch-enemy's corruptive influence, which he knew we would eventually succumb to. His behavior resembles the actions of a cruel or toying scientist who inhumanely experiments with the suffering of the animals in his cage. Not the behavior of some supremely benevolent, all-loving father. 

Euphamize it all you want, but in the end it boils down to the Abrahamic God's biblical character and the tales of his contact with our species showing clear signs of being fabricated by men to control other men, and therefore is inconsistent, needlessly brutal, and immoral in many respects that were not obvious to the men of the time. This is a jealous and vindictive God who supposedly cannot stand false gods, or hearing his name being used in vain, or his ideologies being criticized. He's also strangely focused on the coveting of your neighbor's posessions, and you neighbor's women. Keep your eyes off the booty, buddy. Totally zero signs of being man-made so far, right? Let's go ahead and place all of our faith in *this* God's moral edicts, right?

You're great at noticing the historical context of things, so why do you fail to notice the multitude of ways in which the Old and New Testament can be historically interpreted as byproducts of their respective ancient political spheres? Back from a time when politics *was* religion and religion *was* politics. In ancient times, how could one society ever force their philosophy upon another opposing/conquered society, without framing that philosophy as an ultimatum from a divine being? Religion was only useful before modern times, when it was a fantastic vessel for ethics, medicine, and philosophical discussion, because of the mentally-binding superstition that's involved. But now with skepticism and critical thought as the hallmarks of those disciplines in modern times, we have no need for religion and its overemphasis on credulity and faith.... unless, of course, the religion's somehow convinced you of its supernatural claims and you therefore feel bound to uphold its divinity no matter what."

These were people living Neolithic lifestyles - they hadn't even developed written language or discovered the Wheel on their own yet - and they were being immediately thrust into a rapidly industrializing and expanding society that was out-competing them for land and natural resources that they did not have the agency to defend or reclaim themselves.

Their lifestyles were going to guarantee them poverty and conflict with the Western civilization being formed, and ultimately some method of assimilation and integration into this new society had to take place - we are still seeing the effects of failed integration and assimilation through the utter economic failure of modern day Reservations.

Non Western people from East and South Asia, and Africa, come to Canada often with limited resources, yet manage to run highly successful businesses and secure employment and upward mobility at surprising rates, whilst First Nation people lag behind economically...

Though not one western, Christian culture is killing gay people, so it is interesting that you bring up gay people on crosses. Why do you believe that women, black people, and homosexuals should hold onto resentment of past atrocities that they never faced? Do you think this is helpful in bringing people together for constructive conversation? Do you think this will lead to a productive mindset or do you think it is more likely to be a depressant? Yet again, you're talking about institutional religion that has been used by governments to legitimize claims of authority. All the bible does is give you a measuring stick to hold yourself up to. You can decide what you want to do and you are able to make mistakes and still live a good life. The bible specifically warns against governments that use only the words of the bible to prop up their power.

To briefly cover your next post, morality was articulated out of observation of thousands of years, then we wrote down what worked for us to allow us to live together. There was certainly a time in which it did not exist in written language, and then it was. I wholeheartedly disagree that animals are capable of evil. Sure they can plan, hurt, kill, but malice is not something that is possible for them, nor is the understanding of future suffering that actions may hold. They cannot torture in the ways that humans can. It is beyond them and is strictly a human responsibility. Humans are most certainly superior to animals. This doesn't mean that we should treat them with disregard. Yes, we share parts of the brain, I accept evolution. The evidence of the playfulness circuit is well documented. Though animals are not capable of the goodness or atrocities that humans can create. Our self-awareness is unparalleled on Earth. This places us in a position of higher responsibility since we must always be aware of our mortality and affect on the world over time. You can say these are faith based arguments, but I think it is a bit tedious to explain why this is so if you just observed how animals and humans behave. They do not delay gratification or participate in sacrifice in order to bring about a favorable outcome. Not even small children can do this reliably until it is taught. I'd rather contend with what is presently truth rather than what may become in the next million years. Then you go on about the social duty of humans, while denying that humans have any higher responsibility than animals.

It seems like you want to fault the bible for being a story and doing what stories do to convey ideas. Of course it is a fiction, but have you never gained truth from a song, a poem, a painting? Why would humans create art if it does not communicate their truth?  However, the actual abstraction and understanding of the concepts require very little emotion or leap of faiths to see the logic in. Do you believe that man should hold himself above refute? Do you believe that man should take their commitment to good and truth lightly? Do you believe that man should work every hour of every day? Do you think man should ignore the wisdom of their parents and disrespect what has already be built for us? Do you think man should kill, steal, lie, cheat, or envy? There are many people who do these things every day and I am sure it has not build a stable life for them, their family or community. You reference other culture's myths and how the bible shares quite a lot in common, especially with Mesopotamian culture. You'd be right, and it does nothing to dilute the truth that our ancestors tried to convey in their primitive understanding of the world. But it is neglectful to think that someone of your intellect cannot gleam one useful thing out of the text. 

That said, I'm going to bow out of this one since it's devolved quite a bit. I did hope that some courteous language wouldn't be misunderstood as coercion. Thank you for worrying about offending me, though I'm sure you know it was never used as ammunition for a valid argument. I wish that we reached a moment in which I was understood, even if not accepted, but we didn't get there either. I never cared to change your mind, only to have a conversation.
"	If you cannot get out, then I'll agree the caste system is broken. There can always be hope, especially in western society. Though, I am surprised you view Christianity as the same. I've had a completely different understanding and I've not read anything that promotes actively treating others as less than divine. Certainly, misdeeds invite misfortune, and sometimes bad things happen to good people because of the decisions made by their ancestors. But I don't agree that religious philosophy is to blame for people's decision to warp it to push misguided political agendas.	worldnews	worldnews	1

That kind of stuff just doesn't exist for mounts. The only things I can think of to increase of the ""value"" of the mounts is making them extremely over-the-top, like shape-shifting or a hellfire of particle effects, which isn't particularly unique or valuable, or to add mechanics to the mounts (imagine a world where the Griffon is in the gem store because it's a ""flying mount"") which essentially just amounts to buying power. 

Riot is in a unique position where their highly valuable skins can include features because of the nature of the game that other types of games can't. And even then, I'm pretty sure some of these $20 mounts do have things like new sound effects, it's just not as overt as literally playing music. Getting entire new models from environments artists, with unique animations from the animation team, and having the sound design team create and rig new sounds, is definitely enough to make something more expensive to produce, it's just not as overstated as other types of cosmetics. Does it make the mount skins ""worth"" $20? I don't know, but I can see how Anet might have to price it that way just to cover the cost of making it.

531	You know M+ throughput isn't important in the slightest right? That scene is all about timing spells and cooldowns efficiently, healing ones and defensives. MW as is lacks the survivability that resto druid and hpala have for high keys, and therefore won't be as competitive when it comes to the cutting edge of dungeon runs. I'm sorry to break it to you but the main reason that Druid and Hpala are so powerful in high keys is because they can use their spammable externals (sacrifice, Devotion Aura, Ironbark)  whilst maintaining their own health bar with things such as bearform, barkskin, divine protection, divine shield. MW doesn't have access to such low-cooldown defensives, and therefore can never be as good as druid or paladin. 	You're actually so badly wrong it hurts. Disc priest has a virtue with 2 charges on a 15 second cooldown and can burst much harder when they want to. Due to their survivability issues they can't reach higher keys. EVERY healing spec can reach almost identical throughput through different means but the only thing that makes them stand out is their defensives and ability to deal with one shot mechanics. 	wow	wow	1

If you're Jewish, or in whatever other religions they practice it, I don't judge. I think all religions are equally stupid, so they can do what they want.  
..  
As a circumcised male I can tell you with 100% confidence that it is NOTHING like Female Genital Mutilation. THAT practice is done to establish hegemonic domination over an entire group of people i.e women. They completely remove their ability to find pleasure in the act of sex, and in some very, very barbaric practices (knowing as ""Infibulation"", their entire labia is removed, in addition to the clit, then SEWED SHUT, escept for a small hole.  
On the wedding night, her husband literally cuts her open with a knife and fucks her. They sew her back up, and whatever hole is left is the one he will use. It's actually horrific.  
For guys, they cut off an extra roll of skin.  
They're not cutting off the head of your dick. They don't remove any parts of the organ that are essential to its function.  
To imply male cutting is in any way even close to what women ensure is misogynistic and ignorant.   
edit: to answer your question as a hypothetical though, if we were to come up with a cutting concept that was similar to what men endure, I would say cutting off an insignificant portion of the labia or ""the hood"" that covers the clit might be similar. I wouldn't advocate for that though.

534	"&gt;Besides, there have been multiple bills that hike taxes up to go towards education \(and having lottery go towards it, too\) yet no one knows where all that money went, and it for damn sure isn't education. This is another reason the walkout happened.

Lottery\-for\-education is, in essence, a bait and switch type of scheme \(not exactly, but I can't come up with a better term for it\).  Lottery money doesn't ADD to most education budgets, it supplants other money.  In other words, if the education budget is $100 and the lottery brings in $83, the budget doesn't go UP to $183, it stays at $100 and $83 that would have been paid from the general fund \(taxes\) goes to something else since it was ""covered"" by the lottery money.   States can do the same thing with other bills and taxes.  They aren't exactly lying when they say that money is going to education, but they're not being 100&amp;#37; transparent in the way they present those bills to the voting public.

Teachers don't make $31/hour.  That assumes that teachers NEVER work on the weekend, NEVER work evenings, NEVER work through lunch, never meet with students or parents before or after school, NEVER attend mandatory teacher trainings, NEVER chaperone dances or club meetings, NEVER coach extra\-curricular programs \(many of which do not come with extra stipends\), NEVER provide school and classroom supplies \(which you addressed\), and are making far above the actual mean or mode of what teachers are paid \(averages are a poor metric to use in this situation\).  Teachers have a minimum of a bachelor's degree with ongoing post\-graduate work.  Many have advanced degrees. Even if they DID make $31/hour, that wouldn't be commensurate with what someone with equivalent education and experience can make in the private sector.

556	"Are you making a specific claim of these organizations “paying” Facebook(I’ve seen no proof of this), or saying that supporting republicans “pays off” more politically?

From what I’ve seen it really does look like purely trying to not look partisan. For example their curated new video news lineup replacing trending [seems to be strategically picked](https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-watch-news-debut-cnn-fox-news-1202870102/). It contains a stupid amount of Fox New mixed with a variety of non conservative shows. On the face of it so much Fox News might look like pro conservative bias, but a closer look reveals its Shepherd Smith’s Fox News update, and no shows from their more famous and popular political opinion pundits. Smith is one of the few shows with actual credibility on Fox, and he has downright vilified by conservatives for his anti trump stances and honest fact-checking of republicans these last two years. This makes it seem like a very blantant attempt to look “balanced” by keeping the most famous, influential and pretty much only right leaning news network close to the same screen time of more “left leaning” publications. 

And even though I can’t find a list of all of facebooks known fact checkers, some including [politicfact, factcheck.org and to some degree snopes](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/08/facebook-is-paying-its-fact-checking-partners-now-and-giving-them-a-lot-more-work-to-do/) have all been targets of conservative outrage (especially politics to, which rightly rates many conservative claims as wrong more often, and is owned by the liberal Tampa bay times).  

Taken together it doesn’t appear from what I’ve seen to be a major right wing political influence operation, its merely trying there best to appease everyone and stay out of more trouble. "	"I don’t think it’s likely that they are being paid by heritage or conservatives for using conservative “fact-checkers”.

He is perfect, He loves us by grace alone, and sent His only Son to die for our sins. He created the entire universe, and all of our very lives, and has the power to destroy all things, but sustains and nurtures existence anyway.

Yes, because I think that if there was a higher power that was outside of our ways, we would have an eternal purpose, and would be in the care of something. Based on what I have seen, I don't put too much faith in humanity because I've seen how fallible and evil people can be, and how completely subjective they view themselves and the world around them.

Now lets say a player from Dallas who is making $8 million a year is traded to Toronto.  Does Toronto now have to make that players cap hit 10.5 million(or whatever the equivalent is) against their cap so the player can make the exact same amount of money?

Now all these highly taxed provinces/states would have something else to bitch about with taking on salaries that are higher than the player signed for.

If you exercise, you will see an increase in slow wave sleep (delta activity), but if you put a misting fan on the person so that their body temperature does not increase during exercise, there is no change in sleep.

Delta activity is strongest in the frontal cortex where much of the mental activity of the brain occurs.  If you put a person's hand on a vibrating platform so that you stimulate the somatosensory cortex corresponding to the hand, you will see increased delta activity in that same region of the brain.  If you take a person out for a stimulating day, they will have increased slow wave sleep. 

This all points to that slow wave sleep is related to brain activity, not mental activity. "	"Adenosine changes due to sleep deprivation only occurs in the basal forebrain. We can measure these changes in animals like rats where we can implant a probe in the brain.

This has been well studied for the past 20 years. Adenosine is not the answer to why we sleep, though it possibly underlies sleep homeostasis.

Adenosine is difficult to study in humans because 1) we can't generally implant probes deep in someone's brain, and 2) adenosine is important for heart function so giving drugs that interact with adenosine (outside of adenosine blockers like caffeine like drugs) can stop your heart.

Aluminum unlike steel has no point at which metal fatigue decreases stress. For example if you took a rod of steel, and applied a load to it, then removed that load, it gets slightly weaker. After doing this about a million times, the steel stops getting weaker, and stays the same strength. However, this is not true for aluminum. Aluminum will get weaker and weaker until it fails. Aluminum is used in jets because it is much lighter, and stronger per pound then steel, but it has the fatigue trade off. There is no such thing as a 50year old jet like there are 50 year old cars.

And the main character went from a nameless faceless unknown assassin to the hero cop of Egypt that every citizen knows the name of.

I think I'll get onboard with AC:Odyssey though just thinking of it like playing TW3 instead of an AC game. I probably would've liked Origins fine too if it just didn't have the AC name on it."	"I agree in general with the sentiment of the article.

It *is* jarring (not because she's a woman like everyone is trying to say, and the article only mentions for a short bit) but because it's the only game that does it in a whole slew of action adventure games. God of War, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Spiderman, Dark Souls, Zelda, Uncharted, and so on, none of them have even close to as violent and gruesome of deaths as Tomb Raider.

The only other games to have them are horror games (Dead Space for example).

So I would agree, it has always felt out of place and IMO does not add much to the game. It doesn't fit with the aesthetic the way it does in a horror game and it doesn't do it gleefully the way Mortal Kombat does. It just felt like something done for no reason.

EDIT: I see that some people are saying that Tomb Raider historically had gruesome deaths so it's just staying true to the franchise. I didn't remember that from the old games, but if that's true then it makes a lot more sense.

The whole woman thing IMO just seems like an unfortunate coincidence that now can be latched onto. It just so happens that this is the one of few action adventure style game with a female protagonist and it's also the only one with gruesome deaths. It's just bad luck."	Games	Games	1

If we seek this earnestly, God allows us to find him and hear his voice. Seek this above all things. Having said that, here is a piece of my mind and love for you. If you want to see the major differences, all you have to do is think of what mormonism believes, and read what God has left for us:


***


In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. We were brought forth from the ashes, but were filled with the breath of God and that's what gave us life. Because we were deceived by Satan, humanity entered into sin, and our eyes, spiritual and physical, were opened. This is the major point of contention:



When we sinned against the Holy God, we made for ourselves clothes with fig leaves (Genesis 3:7), and used them to hide ourselves from God's sight. This was the garment of sin. It was the garment of a broken promise, disobedience, and unfaithfulness. The garment of a life away from God. Can you think of a time in which you have worn this?



God then, seeing the unrighteousness we bore signified by these garments, did away with them. He discarded them, since they were our disgrace. He did so as a way of showing us that only Him could make us whole again. And in his mercy, He placed on us a garment of His own design (Genesis 3:21). A garment not of fig leaves, but of skin. This represented the covenant that one day would save us: That He himself would pour blood and life for us, and hide us in it, erasing our transgressions and sin with it. This was a garment and a covenant fit for the King, and something more than enough.



So as you can see, even from the beginning, what God teaches us through our mistakes is not about working our hardest. It's not about doing all we can do. The best that Adam and Eve did was never enough, and it never reached the standards of God. Only God could do the best, and most importantly: what was necessary. By putting on us the skin, He gave us a glimpse that in some way God would give up life. At the time we just didn't know how. You have been taught to clothe yourself with the leaves, but it is God the one that has discarded them. They never won his approval. Instead, he wants you to wear what he has given us.

Moving fast in time, Abraham is asked by God to give Isaac as sacrifice (Genesis 22). Both of them go up in the mountain of Moriah, and God stops Abraham before killing Isaac. In there God says ""I will provide.""



Years later, King David sins, and the Angel of God is sent for the destruction of the peoples. But the angel stops at the threshing floor of Ornan (1 Chronicles 21). He remembers this place, because this is the mountain of Moriah. This is the place where God said that He would provide. This was the place of mercy and covenant. So He gives David a chance, and just by repentance alone everyone is spared.




You have been taught and have seen that a punishment is meant to bring you to the fold. Perhaps you have been reprimanded yourself for doings things that you ""shouldn't have done."" You were taught to keep certain standards, and to do things. You were told that straying away from these rules would bring fury and nonacceptance from God. But look at David, and the kindness of God. His sin was taken away, and his life was renewed, and not by punishment, but through repentance and love. Then, something wonderful happened: God sent fire to the place (1 Chronicles 21). And God then decided that His Holy Temple was going to be built right in that place. 


Think of the times in which you have been told that you are worthy of the temple. You answered the questions in the way they wanted them to be answered, and you followed every condition and rule without straying from it. But God in that chapter tells us that his temple is built not in temporary things, or human ideals. He built his temple with a foundation of mercy and repentance. Just think of it. David sinned, and God allowed him to be welcomed in the place of his temple. God never revoked from him the chance. God wants us to be where he visits. After all, it is a house for ""ALL Peoples.""

Then, one day, these words echoed in the universe: ""*In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the Beginning... The Word became flesh, and lived among us, and we beheld His glory*"" (John 1). God, who at one time had made the world and the universe, became flesh. God lived and walked among us, and as the chapter says ""...*He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.*""


And Jesus, walking and living with us, if we believed in His name He made us sons of God. Before that point we were not his children. We never were. Instead, we were His enemies. But after believing in Christ, we were made sons of God as if we always had been. And Jesus went to the mountain of his choosing: The mountain of the promise and the covenant, and where he had built his temple with a foundation of mercy and repentance, and in there remembering his promise of ""I will provide,"" He then fulfilled the promise, and gave up his life at mount Moriah, so that in death we all could be risen with everlasting life.



This is something you have never been told, and it's been kept from you. But God, didn't discard you, and didn't see you as a problem afar from Him. The distance between Him and us was vast. But He never dismissed us. God himself came personally for us, and when his flesh was beaten, and his blood poured, that skin was put over us, just as it had been put over Adam and Eve, and our transgression and sins were washed away.



Something different is what you have been taught about crossing the veil. Your wife and you, only need one hand, and that is the hand of Christ. As it is written in Hebrews 6, Jesus Christ has already entered the sanctuary and has crossed the veil and the veil is his flesh, and when we believe in his name, He becomes our anchor. There is nothing we need to show him. We are fastened to him, and he pulls us in. We are not kept away, and this is where his promise is eclipsed: We do not provide the access, He provides the way."

594	"I will have percentages for the program below but 531 is a rep/progression methodology that you could apply to any lift that you want. Jim Wendler who wrote the program designed it to work around the ""big four"" lifts (overhead press, bench, squat, and deadlift) and has several variations of the program with different accessory exercises that don't use 531. You could literally apply 531 to just about anything that uses weight (rows, cleans, curls, etc).

The basis is that you work off a few different percentages of a training max (TM) and not your actual max. The reason is that your TM should be a low number that you could theoretically hit any day no matter how crappy you feel. I believe I saw somewhere he said he could probably knock out 5 reps with his TM. The reason for this is if you go in with a max squat of 315, that you hit last year, but haven't hit it since then it's not your true max. But if you can hit 275 no matter the day that should be your TM. He also advocates for aiming even lower and building up slowly since eventually you will stall and the lower your TM is the longer it is before you stall out. When you stall out you lower your TM and build back up.

The TM should be about 85% (give or take 5%) of your actual max and the percentages below should be based off your training max. 

* Week 1: 5+ Reps @ 65/75/85%
* Week 2: 3+ Reps @ 70/80/90%
* Week 3: 5/3/1+ Reps @ 75/85/95%
* Week 4: Deload 5 Reps @ 40/50/60%

I found it easiest to create a spreadsheet and use it to track my weights to use but there are apps for phones you can use too. Deloading every 4 weeks was also kind of overkill and he suggested lowering your deload in a later revision of his book.

My guess is with the PPL you would do 531 on the big lifts and then do accessories with whatever rep scheme.

Edit: I forgot to mention on the sets (other than the deload week) you do as many reps as possible on the last set. So on week 1 you do 5 reps each set but since you're not using your max maybe you can hit 10, 12, 14 reps on the last set. Week 2 you do 3 reps each set and maybe you can hit 8 reps on your last set. And week 3 you do 5 reps, then 3 reps, then AMRAP again and maybe you hit 5 reps. Deload you only do 3 sets of 5 reps. The goal of the program is to set rep PRs rather than max PRs.

598	"God left us an instruction manual and it's called the King James Bible.  You are right in a sense that ""Death"" in the materialistic sense doesn't exist.  Our souls are eternal.  It's just a question of where that eternal soul spends eternity.  In the presence of God or in a lake of fire.  There are only two choices.

This world is for cursed fallen creations of God.  It's run by the biggest baddest fallen creature of all Lucifer who used to be God's chief creation.  Think of Earth like Manhattan in the movie Escape from New York.

Lucifer's entire goal is to deceive you into not finding God so that you go to the lake of fire with him.  He already knows he's heading there and there is nothing he can do.  He just wants to take as many souls with him as possible.

The only way out of this situation is to realize that you are a cursed fallen creation due to this thing called sin.  God defines what sin is and doesn't like it.  We like to compare ourselves to other humans thinking we are better than this person or that.  God is perfect and holy so just a simple lie looks to him like a child pedophile murderer looks to you.  God realized that nobody could live a sinless life so he humbled himself, came to earth as a man in the form of Jesus Christ and allowed himself to be sacrificed to take away the sin from every human.  All that you need to do to have sin removed from you forever is repent of the sinful state you are in and believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is simply:

1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

There will be countless self righteous ""good people"" according to human standards in the lake of fire.  The only way to get out of this situation is to have Jesus Christ's imputed righteousness which you get when you repent and actually believe the gospel above in your heart.  You must realize there is NOTHING you can do yourself.  Every single organized religion out there is false and teaches some kind of works based salvation that sends you to Hell.  All of your righteousness is filthy rags to God.  You can't do anything.  Saying that this is a system of control is a straw man argument since you can't do anything but trust in what Jesus Christ already did for you.  That's it.  It's really that simple."	"Yes there is!  The one who created them (and us) with the gift of free will before they all rebelled.  It's what this entire world (and all the fake conspiracies) sets us up to disbelieve from childhood.  They put a straw man version of the truth (religion) in our face as a child then add Santa (Satan) Claus and all the rest of fake religion so that we dismiss the truth before we can even understand.


The truth is we have a perfect holy God who created us and he is so perfect and holy that things we think are ""no big deal"" (sin) he views with the kind of disgust we see in a child murdering pedophile.  We like to compare ourselves to other humans instead of him.


Because of our sinful state he has us separated from him in this place along with all these other fallen spiritual beings.  He used a people (Israel) to introduce himself back to humanity and to show us what sin is (by the law) and prove to us that no human can live up to his standards.   Because of this he himself became a human in the flesh of Jesus Christ (the man who is called Son of God) and allowed himself to be killed so his blood could be shed for us and his sacrifice would wash us clean from sin forever.  That way after our first death, we can be with him because he gave us his own righteousness via his merciful grace which we receive by coming to repentance and faith in this gospel:


1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 


They key here is realizing that none of us are good or righteous compared to God and only his perfect righteousness can save which we receive though repentance and belief in the above Gospel which is his death, burial, and Resurrection for your sins personally.


Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.


Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;


Our sin makes us deserving of the second (spiritual) death:


Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. 


God however is so merciful, loving, and forgiving he became like us laid down his life for us:


Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.


His blood cleanses us:


Rom_5:9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.


He is our righteousness:


Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 

Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.


All you need to do is admit that you are a guilty sinner and ask God to save you and he will just as you are right now:


2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

Rom_10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Rom_10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.


Salvation is not of any good works, this the lie of every religion:


Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast. 


Cry out telling God you know all of this to be true in your heart, that you understand what he did for you and ask him to save you and he will. 
 He will also send you the Holy Spirit to dwell in you!

Nah, boolean parameters are usually best avoided, especially if there are multiple or they’ve got default values. It’s typically much more readable, type-safe, and resilient to changes to either factor a function with a boolean parameter into two functions, or make that parameter’s type an enumeration—yes, even if it only has two values like `Disabled` and `Enabled`.

For the factoring case, consider:

    var result = DoThing(true);
    var result = DoThing(false);
    var result = DoThing(cores &gt; 1);

Versus:

    var result = DoThingLocked();
    var result = DoThingUnlocked();
    var result = cores &gt; 1 ? DoThingLocked() : DoThingUnlocked();

For the enum case:

    var thing = MakeThing();
    var thing = MakeThing(false);
    var thing = MakeThing(true, false, false);

Versus:

    var thing = MakeThing(Enabled, Active, Visible);

We met online, I won't mention where as its very specific and she might see this thread so let's just say it's a bit like Reddit in the sense that it's just an online forum that we've been members of for a few years (not a dating forum).

She left the forum a few months ago because it was boring but she came back recently so she could post again.

Like, what was this config object used for, why/when did we want to mutate it, etc. If it's *meant* to be strictly thread local and mutable, then we'd want to enforce that with types, rather than adding machinery to allow it to flow between threads *more easily*.

I'm not familiar enough with Rust to know what pattern that would be, but in Haskell `STRef s Config` would do that: a mutable reference holding a `Config` value, that is restricted by the phantom `s` to never escape the thread.

But then you'll have the reactions where the announcer may start to talk and then be shut up. Something like ""... Wait, is that a---"" ""Do not mention the poop in the ring. I repeat, do not mention the poop in the ring"" sequence.

Just like the refs, the announcers are selected because they know how to handle a match in a way that would align with what the WWE as a company wants. But they also have ways to be signaled when they make a ""bad"" call and the like."	Was there ever a proper write up of what happened?

622	First off, I don’t count anything against bj after the Nick Diaz fight. He never should’ve fought Rory, and he never should’ve come out of retirement after that fight. When he lost to nick his record was 16-8-2. So let’s just focus on that record. 2 of those losses were to Frankie Edgar, an all time great and the decision at ufc 112 was razor close. I thought BJ won. Two of those losses also came to gsp, the WW GOAT and once again one of those losses was super close. The other loss is to Matt Hughes, another atg at welterweight. Then he had a close loss to Lyoto Machida at heavyweight. BJ was outweighed by like 40 pounds and he still won a round and kept it close. The draw against Caol Uno is one of the worst decisions I’ve ever seen. BJ clearly won 3 rounds. And the last loss is to Jens Pulver, a loss that was super early in his career and he avenged. And Jens was a bad mother fucker in his own right back then. Anyone that says Penn is overrated wasn’t around to watch him at the time. If he’d stayed at LW instead of fighting in every weight class his record would be much prettier, but then he wouldn’t have the “just scrap” legacy that he does. 	But even the #10 HW or #10 lhw would destroy every flyweight on the roster. As a guy who doesn’t give a damn about pound for pound and all that shit, that’s why I like the heavier divisions so much.

https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/7omuo5/patrick_sullivans_rant_on_ravenous_chupacabra/dsaowvu/

I agree with that guy. Sullivan wasn't talking about efficient removal but about the problem with sorceries on a stick, as you say.

"	"I was writting a really long answer but after reconsidering I will just try to summarize my thoughts:

- Rogue Refiner is generally more valuable than Chupacabra and that is why it's a better card. That doesn't mean Rogue Refiner is always good and Chupacabra is not and that sets them in two different categories. That's like saying Glimmer of Genius is always good because it always puts you one card ahead and Vraska's Contempt is not. Then why don't all blue decks play 4 Glimmer? Rogue Refiner is raw card advantage, and as such is bad when you are under heavy pressure, the 3/2 doesn't help and you don't have the time or the mana to find the answers. 

- I don't see any reason to put Rogue Refiner and Whirler Virtuoso in the same category and not Chupacabra, power level aside. They're all a effect on a stick: one draws cards, other makes thopters and the last kills creatures. They're all situational: if I'm playing against a removal heavy deck I would rather have Rogue Refiner, if I'm playing against MonoRed I would rather have Virtuoso and if I'm playing against Baneslayers I would rather have Chupacabra.

- I'm sorry if I didn't explain myself well with the Hazoret thing. The way I see it there are roughly 4 kinds of creatures being played in Standard right now, or a combination of those: Effects on a stick/ETB (invalidates removal), hasty threats (requires instant removal), resilient threats (requires very specific removal), and cheap powerful/synergistic threats (they might not do anything the turn you cast them and are easy to kill, but they're still worth it). Hazoret is a combination of 2 and 3, but she needs set-up to be 2 and the meta has evolved to mitigate the value she provides. That's what I meant. And she doesn't invalidate removal, she's 50% the reason Vraska's Contempt is the most played card in Standard.

- As long as you have good creatures from those 4 categories, putting Baneslayer-like creatures in your deck is a bad deckbuilding decision. The first category punishes the opponent for having too much 1-for-1 removal, the second punishes him for not having instant removal at the right time, the third punishes him for not having specific kinds of removal, and the fourth punishes him for not having early removal. The four combined make for tough decisions during deckbuilding and the actual games for your opponent. If you play Baneslayers those decisions are way easier: answers can be more generic, they have more time to draw them and they don't have to play around stuff happening on your turn.

I'm guessing that's been your sister's answer every time you've tried to talk to her about her favoritism.

654	Should be fine.  The first win of the day bonus for multiplayer goes a long way towards unlocking War Chest tiers.  You can get that bonus once for each race by the way, which makes it even easier.	"Great question!

The War Chest XP boost applies to your Co-op XP which then contributes to your total War Chest XP.  So it basically applies to both when it comes to Co-op games.

The 50% bonus is calculated based on the total value of all your base XP (mission, optional objectives) and your bonus XP (difficulty, random map etc) but does not include bounty xp (Mutation Bounty, First Win of the Day).

There is a new little info icon/tooltip on the Co-op Score Screen you can always look at if you ever forget how it works (it is kind of complicated) but I will copy that info here:

**Base XP**
Base XP is earned for completing main and optional objectives during the mission.

**Bonus XP**
Bonuses multiply the value of your Base XP.  Examples include:
*Difficulty Bonus*
*Random Map Bonus*

**Boost XP**
Boosts multiply the combined total value of your Base and Bonus XP.  Examples include:
*War Chest Boost*
*Co-op Stimpack Boost*

**Bounty XP**
Bounties are a flat value added to the final XP total and can only be earned once in a while.  Examples include:
*First Win of the Day Bounty*
*Weekly Mutation Bounty*

655	"It's likely that melanocytes have some mutations that can cause moles to form in the first place, but some specific proteins needed to keep growth in check are still functional, meaning that those cells won't keep growing and dividing. It seems as though to become cancerous, those cells accumulate even more mutations, specifically in the genes that provide the instructions for making the protein(s) that keep growth in check, so that they're now capable of replicating forever as a melanoma. The paper I cited above is only a few years old, so it's still a developing body of knowledge.

In a sense, yes, all moles could potentially lose their response to signaling and become cancerous, but it's relatively rare that they'll ever do that. The VAST majority of moles will never turn into cancer, but that's why it's suggested that if you notice changes in size, texture, coloration, etc it's good to get it checked out in case. "	"The overall difference in benign and malignant (aka cancerous) tumors is their lack of response to regulatory signals and potential to spread to other parts of the body ('metastasize'). The science behind the exact driving force of what triggers a benign mole to become malignant and cancerous isn't really clear, unfortunately, and it almost certainly is multifactorial. It likely depends on exactly which mutations occur and what the downstream effects of those damages are. One promising target that some Penn researchers published a few years ago is a protein called p15, but research keeps evolving to discover exactly which genes, which proteins, which signals have to 'go wrong' in order to turn something harmless like a mole into a malignant melanoma. Wish I had a more definitive answer for you!

Science solves that problem by not accepting any unfalsifiable claims, and testing the falsifiable ones.

664	So I would say this is a common misconception amongst a lot of students that I talk to. As someone who applied to many medical schools across Canada - research is NOT a necessary part of a medical school application. In fact, the majority of schools make no distinction on their application between research and non-research extra-curricular activities. Also I know many people in medical school that have NEVER done research before. I think research is a great way to show some of the skills medical school value but there are definitely so many other ways to do this! I think instead it is more important to do activities that you find enjoyable and try to do them at a high level (these often go hand-in-hand)!	"Hi there, great question! I think it is important that we have these discussions about how we can ensure that admission to medical school is an equitable process for those from all social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I am the first person from my family to attend University and growing up no one in my social circle was in medicine. Regardless, I still feel incredibly privileged to have been admitted to medical school and have had the opportunity to pursue the activities that helped me gain admission. Although I would say that from my experience, family income is not an insurmountable barrier to these opportunities! My family is incredibly supportive of the work I do but I personally wanted to self-fund my education. In Canada (and at UBC), I think this is entirely possible due to tuition becoming quite subsidized (compared to medical schools in other countries), student loans are very accessible, and most of the research I've done has been funded by the University or external research awards. UBC Medicine recently posted about their MCAT assistance program that will help lower the costs for students with financial hardship (http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2017/11/01/mcat-fee-assistance-program-for-canadians/)

Regarding your comment about residency placement - I would say from my knowledge, financial or family resources become even less of a consideration at this point. Life experience is not just about traveling the world and I would say facing hardship (whatever it is) gives you plenty of life experience :) Also, your amicability is entirely dependent on you and not what privilege you may have!

I'm not saying this is a perfect system, and undoubtedly it is unfortunate that some groups have a tougher time getting into medical school and succeeding in medicine. However, I do think the system makes an effort to level the playing field and it is entirely possible to build an awesome CV (and career) regardless of your background! "	IAmA	IAmA	1

677	"Brahui is interesting - it's VERY closely related to the other North Dravidian languages to the point that many linguistics argue it must be the result of a recent migration into Balochistan in the Middle Ages.

The genetic evidence, on the other hand, shows that the Brahui and the Baloch are indistinguishable - if the Brahui were the result of a migration only even a few hundred years ago, there shouldn't have been enough time for them to genetically assimilate to the point of being indistinguishable from the Baloch.  So the genetic evidence favors that the Brahui aren't a recent migration.

I think the answer is that many other North Dravidian languages went extinct in much more recent times than people know or realize and that there was a spoken North Dravidian band still extant at least until a few hundred years ago, but only in remote villages and such.

688	"Yeah people who won't let go of this whole 'ASMR is like porn' thing don't know what they're talking about.

Of course there is some ASMR with sexual undertones, like *any other type of content on the internet*.  People can (read:will) make anything and everything sexual, there's literally a rule about it.

I don't watch a ton of ASMR anymore, but one of my go-to videos back when I watched intentional ASMR was just a video of a girl rambling on about her Marvel DVD collection in a soft voice.  Nowadays I like to listen to this guy PeterDraws cause he has a super relaxing voice and puts out a lot of long videos without any music or abrupt changes in volume, but it's not even intentionally ASMR.  Neither are sexual in the slightest.

The only time people associate ASMR with sex is a) when they don't get it themselves or don't understand why people like it and assume it must be some weird fetish or b) when they learn that the one of the other terms for it is 'brain orgasms' or whatever.  I'm fairly certain there's no actual connection to the type of brain activity that happens during actual orgasms.  Plus, the end goal of ASMR is literally sleeping.  People aren't sitting around jacking it to ASMR videos, or at least 99% of people aren't.  The vast majority of ASMR videos aren't sexual in the slightest, and that's not even counting all the unintentionally relaxing videos people use to fall asleep.

People have been trying to put this stigma to bed since ASMR started getting big years ago.  I'm so sick of it."	"&gt;If you're an amateur musician and you aren't comping your takes you're doing it wrong and shortchanging yourself and your listeners.

I agree that comping is a very useful tool, but I wouldn't say it's that cut and dry - or at the very least, I don't think one needs to comp every line or whatever to get the best out of your recorded performance.  There are some songs that I think benefit from the artist doing it all (or very large chunks) of the vocals in one take, it can add to the intimacy of the recording which can sometimes be nice if it pairs with the song's themes.

But yeah it certainly is the best way to do it these days.  And besides, sometimes seeing how an artist plays a song live is part of the live-experience.  Sometimes it's nice being surprised at how they change it up.  If you go to a concert expecting it to sound *exactly* like the album version you're going for the wrong reasons."	videos	videos	1

693	"The A7r3 and the D850 are fantastic cameras. Personally I would go with the A7r3 over the D850 only because it's mirrorless (and to be honest, I'm quite a bit of a Sony fanboy). Both cameras are pretty on par with each other when it comes to image output. The AF system on the Sony is stunningly fast, even with adapted lenses. You can get something like a metabones (mark 5) or a Sigma MC-11 adapter for your current L glass. I would check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dwBtvmm0Xc) to see what performance is like with Canon glass. Be wary different lenses will give you different results. Sony has addressed many missing elements from the Mark 2 such as faster AF, adding dual card slots, a better battery, touchscreen focus, a joystick, the list goes on. They claim that it has 14 stops of DR and from the tests I've seen, it comes nearly close to that.

If you don't want to shoot with adapted lenses, Sony makes a 24-105 full frame equivalent lens that you can snag for about $1300 USD. But if I can, I would like to suggest the 24-70mm f/2.8 GM. Yes, it's $2200 USD, but it's an absolute versatile workhorse. I do have to say though, some Sony glass seems to be more expensive than their competitors. For example, Sony's 24-105 f/4 is $200 more than Canon's.

Concluding, you can't go wrong with either the a7r3 or the d850 if you are willing to spend that kind of cash. Also, there are speculations / rumors that Canon and Nikon will be releasing their first FF mirrorless cameras this year. I'm not sure if this sways your decision at all."	Hi there. First, what's your budget? And are you interested in a mirrorless option, or would you still want to shoot with a SLR camera?

"FF/paramedic here that had the same problem when I started. I was in good cardio shape, but running a decent 5k doesn’t really prepare you for the work you do on the fireground. It’s more about muscular endurance than cardiovascular endurance. 

I wear a 55lb vest and walk on the stairmill for 20 minutes (sometimes with a high rise pack if I’m feeling frisky), or 1.5-2 miles on an inclined treadmill. You can also just walk around the neighborhood with it, or up a hill, or hike with it if you have any good trails near you. Just avoid any running or jumping to protect your joints. 

I try to include things like sled drags/pushes, dummy drags, sledgehammer work, farmers walks, kettle bell swings, and battle ropes into my conditioning.

This just isn't true, and lots of large websites operate at a cost that is not earned back by any function of the website (whether encouraging subscriptions or donations or ad views, etc.).

Again, it's not that it's strictly *incorrect* in that you could say the website helps the organisation function and gain funds in other ways (in a government's case, the website may be part of its duties to its citizens which get paid for through tax), but it is certainly kinda weird to view all websites through that lens.

710	"Perhaps I can point out the false premises in the article later. 

But I too feel like you are not fully considering this from my perspective.

Imagine for a moment that the red you see is actually caused by very specific physical events. And that there is absolutely nothing more to red sensation than those physical events. That they have 100% match. And that whenever any being is experiencing red, those very specific events occur. It is impossible for those to occur without the experience, and impossible to experience red without those. They just are the exactly same thing observed differently. And that we can later discover this.

How could we say anything about these physical events from just experiencing the sensation? Would this inability to say anything be a good reason to presuppose anything?

An allegory could be looking at a rock and touching it. Both observations are physical, but they are not the same observation, despite observing the same object. Looking at a rock does not need to tell about its temperature or its weight, or its hardness. And those do not need to tell about how it looks. However all these are physical.

If you research this further, you will discover that they were even more theists at the begin of their education. 

So learning philosophy of religion has made the group *less* religious.

Imagine starting to study alchemy, homeopathy and snake oilology, and then realizing they are hoaxes. If you are even slightly moral, you will start considering other careers. And if you don't, your whole career is based on people believing in these hoaxes, so obviously it would be rational for you to report that you believe in them.

I would imagine that [the sunken cost fallacy/escalation of commitment is also at play here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment). ""*Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.*""

I don't see any evidence that unlocking these allied races would increase the number of slots on your realm, so it must come from somewhere else, and the closest thing that i can think of is the pre-order of the next expansion as a selling point.

That is easy, look at item builds 3 minutes before the game ended?  There is a billion different easy ways to deal with that one, defined timed snapshots of item builds as well.  Yeah, no one is arguing verbal toxicity is not easy to spot, the issue is that it is the least impactful.  Again, the point here is that inters/afkers are not as easy to spot and have a higher impact on the outcome of a game compared to someone who is verbally toxic and direct causation of afkers/inters can be proven using data.  If you do not know someone is griefing, then yes, it would be hard to distinguish that from people having a bad game.  However, if you know someone is griefing you can show that their performance contributed to a loss just like you can show that someone having a bad game contributed to a loss.

733	"Hello once again, my dear r/anime! In this thread I want to formally announce **second Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei** rewatch on the subreddit, as well as answer some questions surrounding it. Let's get straight into business!

---

&gt; **Why Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei? I haven't heard about this anime/was never interested in watching it.**

To put it simply, it's my favorite anime of all time. I doubt anything would top it for me because there are so many memories connected to it - memories and emotions I want to share with you. If you need less sentimental reasons - you can read them in this **[WT! thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/35bfzk/wt_sayonara_zetsubou_sensei/)** I wrote forever ago ~~and that I need to revise to be quite honest~~. But in short - it's a creative, smart comedy which is focused on a teacher-in-despair Itoshiki Nozomu, his class full of extraordinary students and is oozing with social satire. 

&gt; **Wait, now I remember. You were hosting the very same rewatch a year ago. Why do it again?**

Truth be told, I didn't wanted to host it again initially, and that **[rewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5kfr3v/sayonara_zetsubou_sensei_turns_10_in_2017_anyone/)** was supposed to be one of a kind, at least from me. However, in the past few months I was approached by a lot of people who missed that rewatch or just wanted to watch the series for the first time, but lacked motivation. When number of people reached critical mass, I decided that I'll do it once again, bigger and better than before. That's also the reason why I'm not gauging interest first - I know there is interest, and I know people will participate. Don't get me wrong though - everyone is welcomed to take part! Which brings me to the next question...

&gt; **Any specific reasons why the rewatch is going to be worthwhile?**

Since it's the second time I'm hosting the rewatch, everything is already here. All obscure notes about the series, fanart, interesting comments - I'll try to bring it all in this rewatch, expanding and providing even more Zetsubou experience. I also usually reply to every comment in the threads (no matter how late they are - comments, not threads), so don't worry that no one is going to read your thoughts! I'll be here, *[zutto~](https://i.imgur.com/hk87j1w.jpg)*

&gt; **Doesn't sound too bad. When is it happening?**

I plan to start the rewatch on **9th of March**, on Friday, one month from now. It will give everyone plenty of time to make up their minds, prepare their bodies and souls and download the series. By total coincidence, the previous rewatch ended on 8th of March in 2017. I-it's not like I chose the new date keeping that in mind, [I'll sue you](https://i.imgur.com/9NM701H.jpg)!

Oh, and be ready that we're going to read last volume of the manga when we're done with the anime itself. Those chapters are extremely important to understand the story and what's going on in general. More details will follow later - a week before the rewatch starts I'll post a reminder with a full schedule of the rewatch, and with 44 episodes to watch (three 1-cour seasons and bunch of OVAs) it is going to end right before May. 

Almost forgot - threads are goitng to be posted at **9 PM GMT/4 PM EST/1 PM PST**, as with the previous rewatch.

&gt; **Alright, I'm convinced to join. Where do I watch the anime?** 

Unfortunately, there are still no legal means to watch Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. You know what that means, right? If you have trouble finding the series, just shoot me a PM and I'll give you necessary links. 

---

And I think that covers it! I sincerely hope that the rewatch will be smooth and fun experience for everyone, so don't hesitate and join us in March. If you wanted to watch Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei for a long time, this is a perfect opportunity to do so, because nothing beats watching anime in a nice company. Before that, [don't fall into despair](http://i.imgur.com/fiFDPfF.gif)!

737	I'd say stick with it.  I did the full insanity program a few years ago to jumpstart my fitness, and I was happy with the results.  Don't feel you have to match the pace of the people onscreen.  If you're getting dizzy take more breaks, drink more water and eat something small like a banana or oatmeal beforehand.  Track your progress by how much further you can make it in each workout rather than getting discouraged by not making it all the way through.  Repeat the first month if you feel you can't move on to the hour long workouts introduced in the month 2.  Or you could check out T25.  It's not as intense as the Insanity program, but has similar movements and structure. 	It's only been about two weeks.  It's not a sharp pain, but more of an intense soreness.

742	How is your reading comprehension that bad? They're explicitly talking about your phone's LTE connection, not the tethering.

"I use it for gaming every day. Even GTA V, a pretty demanding multiplayer engine, plays with zero noticeable lag on the 512kbps of LTE bandwidth they allow for unlimited tethering. Even in radio-shitty locations like the bottom of a valley in a brick building, where I live. 

You can't upload many gigabytes in 24 hrs on the 512kbps tethering connection but that's just general purpose internet connection shit, why would you tether for that instead of just copying the files to your phone so they can upload at however many megabits you actually have access to on the network instead of the 512kbps throttle?

We know that animals behave as though they have memories— there are studies in dogs, for example, showing that they'll remember visiting certain food hiding locations after some time. But whether those memories feel like our memories is a tough question for scientists to test— we don't yet know whether it feels like a movie reel when animals are doing a task like that. It's an awesome but still very open question.	Sadly, yes. There are some primate moms that are really mean to their kids.

771	"The rumored new MacBook Air is supposed to have a Kaby Lake R processor (so 8250U and up), will have 8 GB RAM that comes standard with all Apple Macs, a top-of-the-line SSD that comes standard in all MacBooks, and a Retina display, according to the article. It will also be below $1,000 (which, admittedly, could just mean $999), have macOS (positive or negative depending on what you need), and will have Apple's famous support, which some of the best in the industry. It will also be built with Apple's exacting standards, which means a thin and light industrial design, probably with an aluminum unibody. Since the current outdated MacBook Air still sells like hot cakes, I bet a designed superior version would sell even better. The HP one may have equal specs for a lower price, but people are willing to pay the Apple tax for something they think will last versus an HP laptop that could break down right outside of warranty. Even if the HP one lasts for years, perception is key, and the public perception of Apple's MacBook Air line is of a sturdy, capable machine that will last (on the other hand, the MacBook Pro may have a completely different public perception right now).

I used the XPS 13 because the specs were equivalent to what the rumored new MacBook Air will have (build quality will likely be similar). The difference is that the MBA will be cheaper and possibly even have a better display (if the Retina display reports are true), which, if true, means that Apple is back in the game regarding competitive laptop pricing.

I'm also comparing this new MacBook to the XPS 13 because I think the nTB MBP will be folded into this new Mac, which makes it a direct competitor to the lower tiers of the XPS 13."	"In that case, we may see the 8/8+ dropped this year in lieu of the new LCD iPhone's release. The SE might also bite the bullet, cleaning up the iPhone line to 2 models - 1 entry-level, 1 high-end (kind of like the regular/pro variants with the Macs and iPads). 

Given that they have made the non-Pro iPad more powerful this year, it seems like they are using it to target the education market, which puts the 10.5"" iPad Pro in a weird spot. It still has a better display and a faster SoC (I think), but its size advantage is starting to be nullified by the non-Pro iPad's newfound Pencil support. Getting rid of the 10.5"" iPad Pro leaves the 12.9"" iPad Pro as the ""Pro"" device - the laptop replacement, which makes sense given its size. The regular iPad, which I think is 9.7"", remains the standard iPad that everyone knows and loves, and at its price, it remains a compelling option for people who want a tablet but don't need the faster refresh rate or other bells and whistles of the Pro line.

That would leave us with:

* 2 laptops (MacBook, MacBook Pro)

* 3 desktops (iMac, iMac Pro, Mac Pro)

* 2 iPhones (LCD 2018, X2)

* 2 iPads (regular, 12.9"" Pro)

Almost symmetrical, and it would be if they just completely scrapped the Mac Pro, but I think there's still quite a few people out there that like the idea of the Mac Pro and want to see an updated version. Alternatively, the iMac Pro in its current form could just be a stopgap measure, and the form factor (AIO pro device) could be retired when the new Mac Pro is announced. The new Mac Pro would then take the name of ""iMac Pro"" while retaining the non-AIO form factor that is more useful to content creators and professionals that want to upgrade their machines over time. Apple would, theoretically, release new displays to go along with the re-designed iMac/Mac Pro, but that's a different story."	apple	apple	1

"I think what op means is that the punishment should more closely fit the crime.  

If you slap my wife and then I in turn murder your family in front of you and then burn down your village and salt the land, now that doesn't seem benevolent does it?  Or even fair in any way? 

I've actually had the same problem as op.  I'm reading the bible in church and see a passage where god tells the Hebrews to destroy an entire city and kill every man, woman, and child (can't remember what their crime was but it wasn't that bad).  I look up at all the people in church and think how can I and everyone else worship this god if this is true.  

I've dealt with this by looking at the bible for what it is; a book of tales, some partially true, the rest mostly false, that illustrate the history of a group of people.  

The thing is, most organized religions have so many flaws that I'm amazed at how they've flourished and even intensified past the age of reason and science.

784	"You sound really young and naive. I don't mean that maliciously, but at 17 it's easy to say ""fuck love I'm gonna spend forever with just my brother and it's gonna be great him and I against the world"", but that's not realistic. Sure you don't need to date or marry or anything, but at 17 you'll probably get sick of living with your brother eventually and want some sort of privacy in your life. When I was 17 I felt a lot how you did and swore off ever being in a relationship because I thought it was dumb. However things changed with time and I've been in a relationship for two years now with two dogs and hopefully getting married after I finish my degree. It's easy to act like everything will stay the same, but you're honestly oversimplifying it, because a lot can change as you age and suddenly things that you thought were stupid end up actually sounding good to you. 

It feels like you have an unhealthy level of codependency with your brother. Things happen and people change and depending on your brother always being there forever is a really really bad idea. You're 17 and honestly you need to create at least some sort of independence for yourself to allow you to grow into yourself as a person. If I had a dollar for every person who got fucked over because they based their life around a romanticized life with another person straight out of high school (whether that's with family, friend, or romantic partner) I wouldn't have to be frugal anymore. Please, for the sake of your future wellbeing let yourself make friends and experience life on your own instead of chaining your life to your brothers. Moving in together for now is fine, but leave your future open to take opportunities that present themselves to you. 

Also fuck the ""adopt a kid or get a puppy"" statement. That's not how that works and it makes you look like a complete asshole. You sound like a wannabe edgy teenager who has 0 clue as to how anything like that works. You don't seem to be understanding that putting all your eggs into one basket with your brother who refuses to work more than part time in his life is a bad idea. Say something happens and one of you gets hurt or God forbid dies, your plan falls to shit because you're incapable of thinking of yourself as an independent person. It's no different than that high-school couple everyone knows that is so fixated on the life plan with each other that as soon as one of them is gone or something changes their life goes to shit because they spent so much time making ""we"" plans instead of ""I"" plans. 

So in short your plan really is flawed, and your view towards relationships shows an insane amount of immaturity. Relationships aren't about love with a capital L or just having someone to fuck, but it's about finding someone to provide companionship and knowing that you mesh together enough that you chose each other. You're so fixated on this weird you and your brother against the world plan, that it really feels like you're risking crippling any friendship or relationship you ever could have. I suggest taking a step back and looking at your plan again but everytime you see a ""we"" statement get rid of it and focus on making more ""I"" statements. You need to think of yourself more in this, because other people can leave or change or fuck you over, but you're stuck with yourself and your decisions for your entire life.I understand that your brother is super important to you, but planning your life around a life with him is a horrible mistake and it sounds like you aren't mature enough to realize that."	"What's worrying me is that there's no progress towards a better life for either of you. There's being frugal but then there's a point where you're purposely choosing unfavorable conditions to be cheap. Not lifestyle creep, but being frugal while still having an enjoyable life, choosing a reasonably priced apartment in an alright part of town instead of a shitty apartment in a shitty (possibly unsafe due to crime) part of town.

 Don't either of you have any dreams or ambitions of what kind of life you want in your later years? I'm not talking unreasonable ones like being a millionaire with a mansion, but reasonable things like a solid career, perhaps a house, a spouse/family of your own. What steps are you taking to reach your goals, how are you going to utilize your present situation to improve your future?

While I think this plan could be okay short term for saving money to get a good start at life, making your life codependent into your brothers is a really poor choice, especially if it's for the long term like you're implying. If something happens to either of you, or if one of you decides to move forward in life the other is basically screwed. You need to go into frugality with a plan and a reason for making sacrifices for the sake of saving money, or its not going to be sustainable. It's great that you're thinking of ways to save money, but I really feel you need to think of a more solid fleshed out plan before anyone can help you figure out ways to improve on it.

For you, why in the world do you put quotes on ADHD? That obviously shows that you are saying that something about that is bullshit. What gives you the right to say that a diagnosis by a medical health professional about a disorder and the medications necessary to help that disorder isn't valid?

For the community, why do people keep bringing up ADD and ADHD medications when talking about children vaping? Why is this community, ecr, specifically so caught up on this?

806	"Might be.

But consider Holly is much younger too (actress is 15 or so), about the age of Artemis. I strongly suspect the movie Holly won't work in the LEPrecon force or in any job at all. I think its plausible to assume that they still want a relationship between her and the force and Root - so my money is that Holly will be Root's (grand^n ) daughter with a good chance of her later becoming an officer and the struggler there then being having to live up to Root who doesn't want to appear as she is treating her (grand^n ) daughter better. This also means she can serve more directly as an audience surrogate when worldbuilding is of need: visit Root on her job and be shown around a bit or stumbling over the right people, meet Mr Dwarf earlier on in the movie getting arrested or whatnot, having the night of her kidnapping be her first night alone and telling herself the steps of the ritual to not miss any etc. 

And while the books were very sweet, you avoid weird age differences where you have an essentially grown up old (for our standards) person being coupled with a child and later teenager. It avoids potential creepiness, allows for more direct comparison of their paths in life, makes Holly more approachable for kids (I strongly assume that this will targeted at kids and families, possibly similiar to Harry Potter 1,2 in heaviness) and also leaves teh door open for more romantic future developments if the movie is a success and we'll get sequels."

807	"&gt;That's up to a large group of policymaking people and institutions to decide. The fact is that it never gets addressed though. If gun grabbers are going to say ""nothing gets done"" every time a shooting occurs and gun confiscations don't immediately follow, then 2A can say that mental health is also too quickly overlooked.

I don't think people want to grab guns. I mean, it can seem that way, and you can be afraid that this will be the end of the slippery slope, but I haven't heard anyone actually call for indiscriminate bans.

People do want, however, to make it inconvenient to shoot many times in a row. That includes an existing ban on full-auto, limiting magazine sizes, limiting the amount of ammo that can be bought at once, and limiting the ability to buy armor-piercing (e.g. cop-killing) ammo. 

Keeping track of who owns what also helps.

&gt;They also won't care too much if they can use a gun or if they have to rent a moving van and plow it into a flea market.

It's true - and you see them renting a moving van and plowing it into a throng in other countries. 

I have to say, though, that I prefer that. There's only so many people you can kill by ramming a crowd in a van- the car gets stuck. 

In contrast, you can keep reloading the gun, like that guy in Las Vegas. 

&gt;A weeks-old shooting does not generate the furor that a minutes-old shooting does. Implementing this step would force the 24-hour news media whores to figure out a new business model.

You have a point, I agree with that.

&gt;But more importantly, I don't think the focus should be on what laws we can or can't pass. The government already plays too big a role in our lives, it has basically supplanted civil society and I think that's a big part of most of the ills that plague our culture. 

I mean, I knew you'd say something along those lines, but the problem is that in a free marketplace of ideas, the news media who *does* provide that information will outcompete the ones that don't. It's a tragedy of the commons. The media will refuse to cross certain lines, and they will exercise some restraint in some situations, but not in one like this where the people demand a villain to blame and hate. 

It's precisely in situations like that, where only a law can fix the issue. You can't expect companies to self-regulate when the ones that do lose out to those that don't - that's evolutionary pressure in favor of the unscrupulous. Either way, you end up with ambulance-chasers in no time. 

&gt;If people were half as mad at CNN for the role they play in glamorizing shooters as they are at the NRA, that'd be a start.

I don't disagree. The difference is that CNN does not oppose gun legislation, the NRA does - it's a lot easier to criticize someone for their tangible actions and policy positions than it is for reporting the news. 

&gt;The problem is that this would unduly restrict the access of millions and millions of law-abiding gun owners, making them less safe for no good reason and infringing on their most basic constitutional rights. 

I'll just admit that I simply am not really moved. As someone not originally from the US, I don't really think of owning weapons as something that should *remain* a sacrosanct right. It's part of the constitution, and a constitution should be followed until it is amended, but that's a legalistic, not a moral position.

&gt;Mass shootings are not statistically significant. They should not form the basis of our ethos about the natural right to self-defense.

I work in radiation. In terms of radiation protection, we spend about 100x the amount that any kind of acturial risk analysis would dictate we should spend. 

The reason is that the radiation risk has to be evaluated on several levels - individual vs collective, social vs financial, risk vs benefit. A lot of it is simply due to people's *perception*, rather than the reality of the risk.

You could probably say the same thing about the safety regulations of the airline industry vs the average number of deaths.

So in that context it doesn't really matter how statistically likely you are to die of a mass-shooting - the difference is that lightning is an act of nature. Even then, though - we have building codes, etc... that reduce the risk of lightning deaths, in proportion to their cost to individuals, collectives, and risk to individuals and collectives. 

I don't see why that can't be the same for guns - why it *has* to be unfettered and unlimited. There are no rights in the world that have bar-none no limits. 

I'm aware that the argument above is not as well constructed as I would like, but that's as much time as I have to devote to it - hopefully you understand what I'm trying to get to, rather than get stuck on the specifics."	"&gt;I'm not trying to be a dick here, but you are just wrong about this. You're just 100% wrong. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the 2016 election and winner of the popular vote, has explicitly endorsed ""Australia-style mandatory buybacks."" Mandatory, meaning confiscation. She's hardly the only one.

Well, 1) I hadn't heard of it, and I'm surprised, and I thought I was following the campaign well, and 2) all I could find was [this](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-gun-buybacks_us_56216331e4b02f6a900c5d67) where she says ""it's worth considering"" without going into the details of what and how and where. 

I understand that you think the laws they have in Australian are authoritarian, and I disagree, and we'll drop it at there. The point I want to make is that all Hilary said was ""maybe we should do something like that"" and automatically people jump to ""they're grabbing ALL YOUR GUNS!!!"" Australian can still have guns - they're just restricted in which kinds, and need to have permits. 

&gt;This is nonsense, through and through. What you're essentially saying is ""you can defend yourself from armed criminals, but you have to be significantly outgunned because they won't comply with the laws and you have to."" It completely nullifies the purposes of the second amendment, and thoroughly violates both the spirit and the letter of it.

Well I mean, I see your argument. But, that's true of anything, isn't it? I can't make a bomb, criminals can, how can I protect myself if there's such a disadvantage?

Where we differ is I don't think it's very likely you are to actually need to defend yourself. I live in the inner city of a major crime-ridden city, and I still have yet to feel the need to arm myself, or know anyone who is armed. The people I do know who are armed, live in the country away from any invaders, and have never been in a dangerous situation either. Even if I was armed, unless I was facing a single attacker, I sincerely doubt it would do much good. That argument just fails to convince me, I'm afraid. As far as I'm concerned, you're going to be outgunned anyway. 

Such scenarios are simply completely outside my realm of experience. But more than that - they're completely outside the realm of experience of everyone I know in this country - to the point that I suspect it's not actually something that happens to regular people, but that people worry about it in the hypothetical.

I'm legitimately much more concerned that any wacko can get himself kitted like Neo in the lobby scene of the matrix, and get his 15-150 minutes of revenge fantasy before the SWAT teams take them down/force them to commit suicide.

&gt;The truck attack in Nice killed 86 and injured 258. Deadlier than the worst mass shooting we've had.

Jesus. Guess I was wrong. 

Still, I'd rather restrict mass murderer's options, rather than give them as many as they want.

&gt; If you immigrated here and you want us to be more like the country that you came from, I just can't respect your perspective at all.

That's alright. You don't have to respect it. I have the right to speak, like anyone else, and in the context that I (or my children) could one day be the victim of a mass shooting like any other american, speak I will. The US is a free country after all, with liberty of expression common to all Western countries, and I don't require your respect to speak, but I will not silence myself. Personally, I think you could use a different perspective, but that's just me.

It does, however, present a limitation - I will probably *never* bring myself around to think of the right to own weapons as bestowed on mankind by God and Nature. We'll just have to agree to disagree there. But hey, I don't need to agree to listen and learn. 

I will spare you my views on your healthcare system, though ;)"	news	news	1

If compilation units/crates were sufficient for code organization then we wouldn't have modules. Regardless of what libraries are depended upon by the crate itself, I find it useful when skimming unfamiliar codebases to narrow down the module that I want to examine and begin understanding its responsibilities by seeing which libraries it uses (given the reasonable assumption that a given library or module tends to have a well-defined responsibility). For me, the time that I care about the names that get imported is after I've begun reading the code below and want to source the provenance of something unfamiliar. Top-down vs. bottom-up, perhaps.

&gt; You can do that in most modern languages, yet almost none allow for this kind of nested import trees. (Possible exceptions may include ES6). The fact that they are possible in Rust strikes me more as a coincidence stemming from the particular import syntax

I draw the opposite conclusion here: the reason other languages don't support it isn't because they've considered it and rejected it, but because it doesn't flow naturally from their particular import syntax.

&gt; the ""pain"" is actually quite bearable, I suspect that once you account for all the extra braces and newlines, the resulting import block won't really be shorter than what you'd get if you just delineated each item in its own use statement.

The pain isn't in the number of newlines, it's about repetition that accidentally obscures the information that I desire, though I acknowledge that you seem to desire different things from me (but even then, as someone used to braced programming languages, I don't find the braces obscuring)."	programming	programming	1

815	"I guess i should have calculated the pixel loss against the hypothetical 4:3 sensor. In that case the you lose about 16% of the pixels. The other values still apply. Either way, you only lose 8% linear resolution by cropping a 3:2 sensor versus a ""true 4:3 sensor"" assuming the same pixel density. The FoV and DoF change due to the 1.08 crop are also marginal. My point is that the difference is just too small to care about in practical terms."	"I think it's a sensible way to think about this conceptually without talking about specific implementations/sensors. If you have a 2.25x larger sensor of the same pixel count you get 2.25x larger pixels. If you have proportionally more pixels you still get better noise behavior since the influence of the individual pixels noise on the final image (if viewed/printed at the same size) is smaller.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Josh Axe, Eric Berg, Thomas DeLauer, ihealthtube.com, nutritionfacts.org, (all YouTube channels) are people I listen to for good information that can help you understand natural health benefits of food especially anti inflammatory food.

Interesting to note that Rheumatoid Arthritis is auto-immune in nature and starts in the gut. Getting fiber and probiotics in the diet is important in general. 

(I recommend all organic where possible)

Eat: Omega 3 rich foods like Flax seed, Chia seed, Wild caught salmon, Walnuts. They're anti-inflammatory. 
Foods high in sulfur contain something called MSM that reduces joints inflammation, and helps in rebuilding the tissue- High Sulfur Foods: Onions, Garlic, Asparagus, Cabbage

Bone Broth is high in collagen that contain the Amino Acids Proline and Glycine which help rebuild tissue. Get this in your diet if you can. I use it everyday in a powder form that I add to my Kale/Fruit Smoothies. 
Last but not least, more raw fruits and vegetable. They should make up the bulk of your diet. Powerful anti cancer and anti inflammatory compounds. Apples, Kale, Bananas, Broccoli Sprouts, Carrots, Blueberry, CHERRIES (anti inflammatory) Pineapple, Mango, Goji Berry, are a few I use everyday. 

Avoid: Sugar, Hydrogenated Oils, Gluten. These will cause joint inflammation and should be avoided at all costs. 

Supplement: 
-High Quality Fish Oil
-Turmeric- amazing super food and super anti-inflammatory 
-Proteolytic Enzymes- such as Bromelain, found in pineapple, can be supplemented and very effective in reducing joint inflammation. 
-Glucosamine 
-MSM: type of sulfur found in supplement forms. 

These are things you can try that might help with your arthritis along with whatever your doctor is telling you to do.

As for baggy eyes, often remedied by drinking a lot of water since you become bloated from stored water when you're not properly hydrated. Under the eyes is a place that becomes visible. Remember the skin under the eye is thinner than other parts of the face so it's not that uncommon to see discolored or baggy eyes. As always for many other health reasons, sleep 8-9 hrs every night. I recommend getting in bed around 9 or earlier if possible. Sleep that happens before midnight has the most rejuvenating and healing effects.

One thing that would be great to have to is an explantion of why certain cards are taken out and why some cards are put in. For instance, if the guide told me to add [[Searing Blood]] versus 5-Color Humans for a Burn deck and then went on to explain that [[Searing Blood]] is added because 5-Color Humans is a creature-based deck that looks to aggressively deal damage using creatures therefore creature removal is a priority in the matchup. I see people tell what cards to change but don't give explanation which can be frustrating to people new to the game or to a particular format. If there is not an explanation, then you are just blindly following the card choices without knowing immediately the reasons behind the choices. It is my theory that when people do not give explanations, this could point to them not really being confident about their sideboard picks. 	magicTCG	magicTCG	1

829	"&gt; Why is the solution to causing harm to others having harm caused to you? “ You did bad, you face it.” What value in revenge are you, and what looks to be most people, seeing that I am not?

Facing consequences = revenge now? Lol, you're even more obsessed with the word ""revenge"" than others. The answer is simple: certainty vs ""chances"". Removing the criminal from society ensures that the same criminal cannot cause any more harm to the society, vs your solution, while sounds good if it succeed, plays on the ""chances"" that the criminal will turn good. If you can search and read, there are tons of story about criminals going back to the same way after receiving therapy, and causing trouble for society again. And, consequences comes in many form: for corruption, you got stripped of all your money, and have to make your own money again; for minor offenses, you do community services; for murders, depending on the scale, you got jail sentences + therapy, life sentences, or death sentences. It's all decided by the court, after considering all the details that could lessen/increase the sentences. No one gets away scot-free if they do something bad, that's the message sent.

Holy shit, how stupid are you? Apes can't live in big gathering like human because that's their evolution limit. Human starts out the same: living in small groups/tribes, and it's ok not to enforce laws, because it is still easy to control the small group.

The point is that in order to avoid the problems that stem from the tragedy of the commons we could allow for private ownership of bodies of water, or sections of a body of water, in the same way we allow for private ownership of a plot dry land, and then treat the literal liquid water there in much the same way we treat the air that exists in a piece of private property.

"	"They are though. Not that they are literally trying to quantify the opportunity cost of ""x"" years spent in jail vs the financial benefits of the act. Obviously these ass hats aren't doing something like that.

But the mind is constantly doing cost-benefit.

Our whole system is designed around altering that cost-benefit. Increasing probabilities of being caught, increasing the penalties once you are caught. Subconsciously you are determining an expected value of an action or inaction. If you are going to rob a store for $1000 dollars and there is no cop within 10 km, that is one thing. That changes when there is $100,000 but there is a cop around the corner. That changes whether the punishment for getting caught is 30 days or 5 years.

If punishments didn't deter crimes our entire system of governance wouldn't work as well as it does. Obviously the weighting and probabilities are always getting tweaked to maximize the efficiency of our justice system. Police departments get bigger. Sentences get altered.

Now Xeon is a server processor so you could argue that that is simply a *different kind of product* than a typical desktop, but the fact is the they are selling desktop PCs and that just doesn't make sense to me you can *only* configure them to use server processors. Xeons are more stable and have better thermal performance but these benefits are generally negligible for most users. When it comes to performance computing power, it's just an excuse to raise the price way higher than necessary. [Here's some creative users that appear to agree with me](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=1420169). On top of that the fact you can't configure to use the latest components so already by going with apple you're using 1+ generations of outdated hardware.

Another example is that the monitor is 27"" 5K display when 4K displays are the standard. [Searching for a 27"" 5K monitors on amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_3?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=5k+monitor&amp;sprefix=5k+%2Caps%2C144&amp;crid=52GPFJE5EWB8) shows that 4K monitors are usually &lt; $500 while barely any 5K monitors popup and the one that does is $1500. So to me it's another example of Apple going against the grain to use nonconventional parts to justify higher costs for marginal benefit.

Assuming I stick with all the minimum requirements and the price is still $5K for an iMac Pro, You could make a desktop with a 4K monitor for &lt; $2500, and probably it would have even better performance. Below is an example I might make to replicate performance of the iMac Pro with a desktop: I'm using a 9700k which is [ranked 7th in all CPU's by performance](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/) for $420, and has 8 @ 3.6Ghz cores like the minimum in the iMac Pro build @ 3.2Ghz. If 5K monitors were reasonably priced then it I'd still have $300 of room to upgrade from a $4K monitor.

In telescopes/astrophotography people more often talk about absolute aperture (= size of the entry pupil) which indeed is larger in a 80/5.6 lens than a 50/5.6. Which is why we bother with f-numbers. They normalize aperture to the focal length so a fixed f-number corresponds to to the same exposure independent of focal length and format. On the 80/5.6 there is indeed more light entering through the aperture, but it also gets projected over 80mm instead of 50mm which causes a square law drop off and the resulting illumination at the image plane is the same again."

Dude, a girl who was not a virgin was for all intents and purposes unmarriable. This both penalized the man and gave her required social status.  Not only must the man pay days wages, he must marry the girl and provide for her and Daddy and brother would be watching!

So the all powerful God will bow to the will of men?

No, you have the freedom to believe and do what you want, otherwise you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.  You have the choice to walk the straight and narrow or $%#% and pay the price.

Exodus 21:20-21 “When a man strikes his slave, male or female, with a rod and the slave dies under his hand, he shall be avenged. 21 But if the slave survives a day or two, he is not to be avenged, for the slave is his money.

The word “avenge” is a specific term used to talk about God’s justice and fairness, its meaning is “life for life” justice.  So the the guy dies for killing another person even if it is a slave.  Not like how the Jews were treated by the Egyptians...but that's ok.  If the slave was not able to work for a # of days, you lost wages from the work he could of done.  We see later in the passage (26-27) that if the master disciplines the slave so that they receive physical damage (ex. an eye) that fair compensation to the slave is freedom.  I'm sure a couple of Jews were freed back in Egypt...

The Roman writer Pliny tells of a case where a slave accidentally dropped and broke a crystal goblet. His owner immediately threw him into a courtyard fishpond where he was torn apart by savage lampreys. 

Leviticus 25:44-46
Slavery prevailed in the ancient world, this was thousands of years ago, this isn't 2018.  You neglect, ancient history, philosophy, culture and ancient government.  Don't you understand this wasn't God's will, they all lived like this!!!!  The antique world was full of slavery. In Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Rome, etc., the practice of owning slaves was common.  There was some kind of crazy notion that it was in the natural order of things that some men should own others so that the higher classes could develop and grow.  The practice was barbarous in most of these cultures and yes, Slaves were not “people.” They were chattel, pieces of property to be used, or even disposed. These people were tortured or murdered at the owner’s bidding. Such cruelty obviously was not consistent with the will of God.  This was the world economy than...how many times do I need to repeat this??

I can keep going and provide an answer for every single verse you posted.

Yes slavery is immoral.  The Bible does not reject slavery outright, the conclusion that it actually favours slavery is patently wrong. Scripture does reveal that slavery is not ideal.  It was regulated and not endorsed because the people wanted it.

God does not change His mind.  We made the decision to sin, not God.  You can't enforce laws on one tribe alone...they would have got creamed buddy..lol. 

You got the freedom to do what the hell you want in this world, we are not robots, God doesn't use a transmitter to control people.  God doesn't tell you I'm your king, you cannot have anyone else.  I see a creator, who has the balls to create people to make their decisions in life and just because it ain't peaches and cream doesn't mean God is immoral.  And you don't watch commentaries...you read them...I'm going to call it a day.  It was a nice discussion.


"	"You shouldn't know everything about that religion because the info is scarce at best.

I'm not picking and choosing nothing.  I accept the world as is it is.  We live in sin, we are constantly in defiance.  Circumcision was not just a ritual, at a time where you couldnt just go to a pharmasist to take a wonder pill circumcision had some benefits such as decreased risk of urinary tract infections. There's actually more.   You can look this stuff up today???  

Condemning rape...you were killed if you did it?? 

Dude, the world of yesterday wasn't the same as today.  Another example is the Jews wanted a King...why do you need a King if you got God??  

But when they said, “Give us a king to lead us,” this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the Lord. 7 And the Lord told him: “Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king. 8 As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you. 9 Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.” 1 Samuel 8:6

I answered you remarks about slavery, it's in our history.  God didn't endorse the Jews having a king just like he didn't endorse slavery.
On the way to Canaan, God tells his people through Moses that the alien, or foreigner, among them should not be oppressed (Exodus 23:9).

There are so many commentaries out there, why don't you just Google them??

873	"My argument was that calling Steam the biggest DRM system doesn't really say anything to it. The DRM is optional. It's the biggest digital distribution platform for games. It could also be the biggest platform for DRM-free games if consumers wanted it. I'm not sure why the fact that Valve use DRM in their games means that the option of not doing so doesn't exist. 

The article doesn't praise Valve for not using DRM. It's quoting a reddit post by a indie dev who's praising the features Steam has and how it differs from competition. It's commentary on how Steam grew by providing tools for users to achieve organic growth rather than domineering. Most people don't care that a game on Steam has DRM because it's barely a negative and at this point they probably gain some decent functionality from it."

875	"No it's not.  I don't want to make that comparasion because Chinese Wuxia as an analog to Western Fantasy doesn't really fit right.  Beyond that, Tolkien's work relies extensively on his ability in world building.  Jin Yong's stuff relies heavily on his ability to appropriate different historical eras of China.  Jin doesn't have to come up with a new dialect of a new species of a human-like race, because Jin Yong's world doesn't deal with inter-cultural exchanges between races of bipeds.  He seldomly even dealt with inter cultural exchanges between Han and non Han Chinese, because those circumstances were rare in the historical eras he borrowed from.

&amp;#x200B;

The scope of comparing a writer of one culture to another, just because they both belong in this category of 'fantasy', from two cultural settings on different sides of the British Empire, written in two different languages aimed at different audiences, is lazy.  I don't need a western analog to introduce one of Hong Kong's greatest newspaper men whom was even more successful as a fiction writer.  But if one had to do it, I wouldn't have picked Tolkien as a counterpart to Jin Yong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, comparing Jin's work to Shakespeare is not like comparing him to Spielberg at all.  Shakespeare is perfectly fine as plain reading material.   Spielberg's is definitely not.  I can enjoy Cha's work on film, a television show, a stage produced musical, a comic book drawn by authors from Hong Kong (or Japan for that matter) or as a novel in its original form.  His stories defy medium.  I don't think anyone is confused by that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"	"When those corny television series were composed out of one of the popular Jin Yong series, my father would watch one episode with me, talk about how much the book was better, and told me where to find them on his book shelves.  So long as I put them back where I found them, Dad had no problem with me messing with his books.  

&amp;#x200B;

Talking with a parent about something related to a Jin Yong novel was something of a rite of passage for me.  However, I wish those comparasions to Tolkien would stop.  Tolkien never had to serialize his books in newspapers.  Jin Yong did, and had to manage at least a few competent 'Fuck Yes' moments every dozen paragraphs.  He wrote something for everyone.  His stories had interesting allegories to China and Hong Kong, past and present.  There was plenty of action, romance, politics, social commentary, and could be enjoyed at middle school reading levels.  He had every intention of being a mass market story teller and succeeded in that regard more so than any other Hong Kong author.  

&amp;#x200B;

Jin Yong as the Tolkien of Chinese Fantasy is a lazy comparison.  Jin Yong was our Shakespeare.

878	My dad did that. Tells me he wants help washing and waxing the cars. Go to help and he just redoes what I do. He doesn't think he shows frustration but he's really passive aggressive about it. I would bring it up and he would just say I'm doing fine. Eventually in high school I just stopped helping him because I got tired of it. 	"This is important to understand about the not knowing you're helicoptering. For example, my best friend in middle school/high school had the stereotypical Asian hoverparents. She was made to start studying the SAT in 6th grade twice a week. Her parents very strict about when she could go out and she had to always call if she wasn't at home, was expected to be in multiple hobbies. That friend ended up having to drop out of college because of the break downs. She's a lot better now. Now for me, my parents weren't overly strict, but my dad babied me and would re-decide my decisions growing up because I ""didn't seem sure enough, we should keep looking"". I'm an only child so my parents were constantly paying attention to me. I had chores, but my mom never punished me when I didn't do them and would just do them herself. When I got older and started doing adult tasks like waxing my car, he would always take over because I wasn't ""Doing it right"". When cooking meals, my parents would always take over without me asking. I made it through grad school just fine, but I get extremely stressed out when I have to make decisions, horrible at cooking, I procrastinate things I have to do in fear of doing it wrong, and have full on anxiety when I get critiqued. 

Both of us grew up with parents that loved us dearly and we knew it, both helicoptered in different ways. But both of us have anxiety disorders. Autonomy of a child is so important. Kids need to make mistakes and do things their own way in a safe environment. "	science	science	1

Using these resources, I was able to get Guardian for the first time. I did it in less than a month. I didn't bother playing that much thereafter. So, in a way, I sort of overdid it for the goals I'd set.

887	"I should probably just say ""fair enough"" and move on.

But... I hope this doesn't seem too jerky...

When you say that ""it probably just happens that this man-made concept is objectively true"" you give away the core of the argument.  On naturalism it's just lucky that math applies, but on theism the reason is that the universe was designed to be fundamentally intelligible.  I don't think this is Craig's strongest argument.  I think an atheist can make a pretty good case that it's just impossible for any universe to exist where math doesn't apply.  I don't know what that argument is, it's not obvious to me, but I don't think this could be as strong long term as the cosmological argument you respond to in the second part of your post.

Hey, thanks for engaging with me and being polite.  I hope I was fine for you, and that this exchange was a positive experience."	"I'm a christian.  I believe God does exist and that there are good reasons for it.  I also agree with you (with an upcoming caveat).

You and I agree that 

&gt; the burden should be placed on the one making the claim (there is a God), not for someone else to prove the claim is wrong. I can’t prove there are no invisible flying fairies but that does not then mean there are fairies.  

And that it is not fair for someone to justify their lack of belief that God exists.

Here are the couple of places I think we may disagree:

1. Many Theists, (including myself) can be rude or dismissive and we need to work on that.  However, I suspect that in some percentage of questions as to ""why you do not believe.""  Were simply aimed at ascertaining more information, where are you coming from as it were.  Are you super familiar with the arguments, are you a newcomer, do you care about reason or emotion more?  I think that's fair for either party to ask each other so that we know where to start.  However, you're probably right.  Some theists were probably just being lazy and trying to get you to justify something you didn't need too.  If they do present a good argument though you should be open to engaging with it, and if you find it convincing be willing to re-evaluate your beliefs.
2. I don't think I've ever heard an apologist for any religion resort to ""you just have to pick the religion/belief that you believe is correct.""  Christian and Islamic apologists tend to start by arguing for the existence of a generic God.  Once someone is convinced of a generic God, much of the specific evidence for a religion (historical impact, miracles, personal life impact) becomes much more plausible.  If you find the existence of God highly unlikely you will be highly (and rightly) very heavily biased against something like evidence for a persons supernatural Resurrection from the dead, no matter how compelling.  Additionally, the main religions that postulate this type of God are Islam, Christianity and Judaism, religions like hinduism, bhudism, new age, janism, taoism etc. are radically different and recieve no support from arguments for geneneric theism or deism.  But, ya, if someone is making a fallacious argument from consensus they're wrong
3. If someone simply does not believe there is a God that does not require support.  That is simple withholding belief.  However, if someone makes the claim that there is no God, or that they know there is no God, or that they are 85% certain there is no God, they have just made a positive claim themselves that needs support to be accepted.  They could maybe justify some confidence in said belief with Occam's razor (having fewer moving parts in ones metaphysic is preferable to more), but that isn't super compelling.  You can be agnostic, unsure about whether there is a God or not without needing to support that view (not believing in a God).  However, if you are an atheist (here defined as holding the belief there is no God) you need some support for that positive claim the same as the theist."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

890	Newtons laws is very accurate and easy to work with in most cases. However they get less and less accurate as the speeds involved gets larger and larger. So if you want your physics to be accurate at higher speeds you need to use Einsteins laws of general relativity instead of Newtons laws. This makes things much more complicated but more accurate. The threshold for when you switch away from classical physics and to relativistic physics depends on your application. However a good rule of thumb is around 10% the speed of light.	You can do an experiment to how much effort it would be to lift a weight from the ground using the different forces. If you use the strong nuclear force it would be hard to get a small enough experiment that can not lift the weight. Considering that even a few protons is able to hang together through nuclear bombs a small weight would not cause them to yield. The weak nuclear force is much weaker but it can still hold up your weight using just a few strands of carbon fiber. The electromagnetic force is again much weaker and instead of a few strands of carbon fiber you would need at least a 9V battery to lift a ton of weight. But when you consider that what was holding down the weight in the first place were the entire Earth using the gravitational force it is quite easy to see how weak it is. As to why these forces are the strength they are we do not know. We can only experience these forces and measure them but we can only speculate as to why the physical laws are what they are. This concept is enough to make people religious.	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1

That leaves out time he spends working on other projects, most notably Wild Cards which has become a meme. I believe he edits all of them, which involves  reading every single one and making sure there are no timeline problems and stuff like that... and more. He wrote an entire blog post defending his work for Wild Cards while also kind of playing the victim by saying how involved he is in it and just how much he does for that series.

How she acted was not even remotely as stalkerish as you’re implying- based on the information you gave us. Maybe kinda clingy at most, I would say.

And you kinda were an ass. Whether it’s as SOs, FWBs or just friends, making plans with someone and then blowing them off without notice is rude, especially so late into the night.

I do,however, understand where you’re coming from because you don’t really want anything more than booking up with her when she wants more.

Also, for future reference, just because you’re calling her cute nicknames and complimenting her doesn’t mean your being nice. That just sounds like what some dude at a bar who’s trying to hook up with a girl would say. Being nice would mean informing her when you can’t make plans, and being respectful and such (not trying to imply you weren’t respectful but just giving an example)"	relationships	relationships	1

And swapping bars is actually another button press. I would call the 20 hotbars ""organ"" and the hidden ones ""piano"" as it's more linear.

Anywho, when it comes down to button pressing, if you decompose the rotations over time and not purely the number of buttons, since the point is to use all of the available bar, then engi and ele are inherently more ""piano-like"" because switching attunements requires much more management than just swapping weapons every 8 to 9 seconds, while also switching in the right one.

Condi warrior is clearly not as piano as staff weaver since it relies on mashing all you buttons with one logic process in mind to achieve top DPS. Weaver however cannot be put at the same level.

I just e-mailed the local mountain rescue association.  Talked on the phone after that, and attended one of their meetings.  Rest was history.  

For what we did you didn't have to have a particular cert (minus basic life support).  But must people on the team had medical experience.  Looking into something like the Wilderness first responder (wfr) would be a good place to start.

Other than that it helps to have some basic knowledge of mountain travel techniques (crampons, glacier travel, rope work, anchor building, avalanche conditions, orienteering and more).  If you want to build up those skills consider joining the Mountaineers or taking a class with AAI or someone similar.

929	"This is my thinking - can't imagine I'll be clamoring to play any modern title in 15 or 20 years.  Just like I don't really care to revisit even the classics from my childhood during the PS1 era and earlier.  Sure there is some nostalgic appeal to it, and there are a handful of games I have bought remasters of on modern platforms, but ultimately I don't spend a lot of time with them, and watching a YouTube let's play for a few minutes is enough for me.

I think there were always be a rerelease/remaster market for old games, should platforms like Steam for some reason wane, or hardware no longer supports them. 

But honestly, the older I get the less time I have for games, and the more interested I am in just playing whatever is new and good right now.  Realistically, I'm never going to go back and replay 60 hours of FFVII today, and I'm sure I'll feel the same about Witcher 3 or something in 15 years.  What is the point, when whatever is new then will probably be mindblowing relative to whats on offer today?"	"&gt; Where is the evidence? Point me toward his ""marketing"" that wrongly convinced everyone he was an inventor.

It's comical really.  The iPhone reveal keynote is legendary.  What was all this brilliant marketing people claim sold what they seem to believe was a ho-hum product with nothing innovative?  Literally just Steve using the phone and walking through what it does the way people would actually use it.  The 'brilliant marketing' was literally just an extension of what the product actually was.  And the product was simply better than anything else at the time.  The touchscreen functionality and seemless interaction with a simple and refined UX was groundbreaking.  It was self evident to nearly everyone at the time, but revisionists like to claim it was 'just marketing'. 

If the touchscreen were as limited and unresponsive as others at the time, the interactions as janky, and the web browser and OS as boring and opaque as everything else, no one would have cared, regardless of how Steve 'sold' it.

942	"Last point:

Dude, what do you want me to say? Starvation is good? Of course I don't think that. No one one thinks that. Do I think poverty is good? No.

This is the most powerful point: Capitalism, for its flaws, is a force which slowly raises everyone's living standards more than any other system ever thought of until now. Maybe there is a better one. I don't know.

Social democracies like Sweden are not socialist systems with capitalist leanings. They are capitalist systems which want to nullify some of the externalities and help people left behind. A welfare state is not a socialist state.

When you start criticizing capitalism as a system you sound silly. It's like criticizing gravity. So if you want to give people better parachutes, we can have that discussion. We can't have a discussion where you insist gravity is a bad system. Voluntary transactions are a natural part of the system. Always have been.

Socialism has been tried. It failed so utterly it killed the people it tried to help.

Here's an anecdote: In feudal England farmers were serfs. The system was set up so that everyone was beholden to someone else. King gave land to overlords in exchange for fealty, they gave land to other more minor overlords, etc., etc. and those overlords let serfs farm their lands. The serfs kept a small cut of the produce at the end. They were locked into serfdom. That was the function of the system. Overlords (landowners) went to war, serfs farmed the land but didn't own it.

Even though this was how the system worked, serfs eventually started to stockpile their savings and started to buy their way out of serfdom. The kings implemented currency to make the economy easier to run. It also allowed serfs to more easily purchase their way out of serfdom. They found someone with land to sell and had a voluntary transaction to get themselves out of serfdom.

Even though the system was designed to prevent this, market forces eventually freed many serfs in feudal England. Supply and demand and voluntary transactions.

Kings eventually were pretty pissed because free landowners did not necessarily owe allegiance to the king, since they had removed themselves from the system (although laws changed to account for changing conditions as well)."	"The market does know all. People don't. That's the problem of imperfect information, which is getting better in the internet age. 

The market refers to a natural system which has existed for almost the entirety of human history. It's not a codified system. It's just millions of voluntary transactions."	news	news	1

"	The point is that jobs are created by demand. They have to be as a business exists due to demand. His argument is that jobs create demand therefore jobs must come first. It's a supply side argument that historically is incorrect.

Imagine a Borderlands/Elder Scrolls/Witcher-esque RPG game but set in Diablos world. Just expand on the RPG part and give player choices in the history you play. *(Cause Diablo has never had a lot of player choice if I recall.)*

But you would still have Classes to pick from giving you your flavor and abilities. You still have a metric ton of Armor and Weapons to utilize. And everything bloody and gory is right in your face.

I didn't have a job at one point. But I read a lot and had a garden. I was still trying to improve myself. Always try to build equity in yourself regardless of how your situation. Then you can take passionately about that stuff, reading and working out are two examples.

I'd wear that when I wore my cordivan shoes and belt with the chrome buckle and pair it with my cordivan leather watch band.

Casual wear I liked my gnarled silver ring most of the time with a brushed metal belt buckle (I tend towards white metals... Have very little brass and gold)).	I had the real ring i got married in safe at home. Rarely wore it.

It's not purely about jokes or ridicule, although in an open society the right to satirize a group is more important for free speech then is readily evident to you. 
Why is the focus solely on Islam. First off its not. Christianity and other ideologies are roundly criticised where their beliefs are counterproductive. 

And, second, because Islam holds ideological ideas such as the idea of takfiri and infidel to name two major points that are dangerous and causing chaos in the world. 

We can't continue to pretend that ISIS and terrorism have no link to Islam. We don't pretend that Catholic missionaries telling people in HIV ravaged counties not to use contraception has no link to Catholic dogma. All religions are not the same, and specific belief and specific dogma lead to specific behaviour among those who believe it.

My main problem is that any intellectual in the public space that would raise these issues is immediately branded Islamophobic. Which is pretty clearly the aim of groups like CAIR, and most liberals are happy to go along with it, because they themselves don't understand religion, and as non-believers have a hard time believing anyone really truly believes these things.

That said, it's disingenuous to say ""I don't know"" in domains that are both momentous and inevitable (to borrow William James).

I don't know whether the human race will survive another generation, but I must act as if it will survive another million years (and so treat the environment a certain way, invest in education, etc.) I must act with 100% confidence that the human race will not be extinct soon, even though I only believe this with 10-15% confidence (after reading John Leslie's damned book, End of the World.)

You may not know if the miracles experienced by millions of people around the world, today and in the past, represent anything potentially interesting about the world... but you must act.

Enjoying this discussion, will try to reply in more detail to your comment above! My child is sick and keeping me up late so I have extra time for Reddit arguments, lol. "	"Hi OP, thanks for the insightful post. You did a lot of collecting of good Bible verses to make the point. 

Essentially, your argument is a reductio ad absurdem taking the form: ""If X, then Y. Not Y. Therefore not X.""

1. If the world is full of magic (as the world seems to be described in the Bible), then there will be verifiable, creditable magic to be present in history and in modern times. 
2. But there isn't verifiable creditable magic in history and modern times. 
3. Therefore, the world is not how it is described by the Bible --  a world full of magic. 

I think you well supported the first premise. And the conclusion follows from the two premises. 

The place to look is your second premise. The second premise you simply stated. You said that history and modern times are not replete with miracles (except ones that are ""discredited""). 

If I challenged the second premise, asserting that anyone who cares to investigate miracle claims (from Christians or any other group) will discover that the observable world is indeed full of them, what would you say? 

I'd venture that some people (and just wait for the comments!) will mock me. But let's ignore them. 

- Some people will say that many miracle claims have been discredited. That's true! But many historical claims have been discredited, and that doesn't discredit all of history, only those claims. Many historical claims, and many miracle claims, have been credited and verified. 

- Some people will say ""Where's the evidence? Prove it to me."" To that I say, four things: first, I'd say beware of sealioning. It's not my job to prove to flat-earthers that the earth is round. It's not my job to prove to materialists that reality is material and formal. If you don't know how things stand, or who to trust, that's on you. But if the question is sincere, perhaps start with Craig Keener's book, *Miracles* (https://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-New-Testament-Accounts/dp/0801039525) Thirdly, ""proof"" is completed when the proof has been given. Persuasion is not the same as proof. I can prove things to my five year old son that will not *persuade* him because he is being unreasonable. So you have to persuade yourself; the proof is out there.  

Fourthly, and relatedly, the problem with doubting a thing's existence is that doubt disincentivizes the search for evidence. If I don't believe in sea creatures, I am not likely to go swimming in the ocean looking to ""prove"" to myself that the ocean is indeed empty. 

All that to say, the evidence and proof are plain to most people and readily available unless you are (a) already so sure that you're right that you only mock and dismiss those who could potentially offer you evidence and (b) don't go out of the way to seek the uncomfortable truth about our world. 

I believe in science, have a Ph.D., and have personally experienced miracles and know people who perform miracles with some regularity. So, despite skepticism of some particular claims, I credit many of the Biblical stories, historical stories, and modern stories. I don't think that I am weird in this way. Disbelief in the supernatural is a minority report, globally. Most scientifically educated Americans believe in the supernatural. About 50 percent of working scientists are religious and believe in a god or higher power (footnote: http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/)

So there is nothing particularly wild or mysterious about the phenomena you describe as ""magic."" I've seen it personally, and hundreds of people I know have experienced it personally. So, when I consider the evidence impartially (including verifiable eye-witness accounts), I'd say your second premise needs revisiting.

But like I said, I appreciated the post, and enjoy thinking these things through. 

I'd appreciate *non-mocking* thoughtful responses as well. 

Cheers!

&gt;Obviously, if you want to know how the children of same sex parents fare, you would study the children of same sex parents, not develop some Rube Goldberg explanation from studying single-parent families where, obviously, having only one parent is a huge confounding factor.

This is nothing overly complex about this. We don't study homosexuality this way. This is studies on fatherlessness and motherlessness to see the effects of a father and mother on the family, controlling for other aspects. From this we know what heterosexual fathers and mothers bring to the table and what is loss with their disappearance. Now if you're going to address homosexual parenting you're going to have to figure out how to make sense of it in comparison to the other things we know, such as these studies.

&gt;To put it differently, if you are really interested in figuring out the effect of having a father (for example) vs not, the best way to figure that out would be to study two parent families with and without a father.

That takes for granted possible differences between homosexual and heterosexual fathers and also doesn't compare what the mother brings in relation so that wouldn't do at all and have too many holes to be sound at all.

&gt;Using studies of single parent families to criticize, let alone make policy, about two parent same sex families is clearly inappropriate.

They aren't used to make policy. They are used as they are primary evidence to there being unique parenting aspects that fathers and mothers bring. As such we would need to understand how this makes sense in relation to homosexual parenting couples and vice versa. No way seems to lead to complete equality.

&gt;Apparently, because so far I haven't seen anything in your posts stating exactly how we should do so, let alone why. 

Because that was never the topic. You said that treating people differently is discrimination. I said not necessarily as different treatment doesn't necessarily have to lean on hatred or unfairness and gave examples (parenting, psychology, marriage definition). You're now changing topics from whether it is discrimination to why I think we should discriminate. This not only is a dense reuse of the term ""discrimination"" that I just took the time to show you was incorrect but also a movement of goalposts from the theoretical topic of whether it is discrimination to the practical topic of why we should discrimination.

1007	"This is my time to shine!

I took a trip to Japan last year. 

Airfare is NOT as expensive as you think.  I flew out of LAX.  My tickets were, final price, less than $400 round trip ($394 or something).  If possible, wait for a price drop.  Bide your time.  I recently saw round trip for around $500 and round trip nonstop for around $600.  Depending on where you live, it may be worth it to wait. 

I booked Airbnbs in Nagoya and Tokyo (Shinjuku).  I picked Airbnbs close to a train station.  I think it was priced $20-$30 a night for 2 people.  I saved my being a first time customer and using a coupon code.  I understand that Japan is cracking down on unlicensed Airbnbs, so my numbers may be outdated. 

Food was so cheap I almost died.  Everyone I know who went to Japan before me told me the food was ridiculously expensive.  I was prepared for the worst.  Oh how they we're wrong!  I used Tabelog to find restaurants to eat at.  It would be the equivalent to Yelp.  Whenever I was hungry, I just pulled a search for my area, filtered by price, spend a minute scrolling, and then set out to find food.  I ate some fast food, but mostly small restaurants.  

Breakfast.  We typically didn't get hungry in the morning.  I went out to grocery stores or convienence stores to grab a snack to get us through the morning.

Lunch.  A lot of restaurants do a lunch special.  We typically ate a relatively nice sit down meal for lunch ($5-$10 each for lunch specials).

Dinner.  We ate at popular restaurant chains or random small restaurants.  Bar food surprisingly filled us up whenever we went out, so sometimes there wasn't a need for a sit down dinner meal.  If you're on a tight budget, many places have a menu or vending machine ordering system.  You can look with no pressure.

Excursions.  This is where you may break the bank, depending on where your interests are.  We spent a lot of time in Shinjuku, Harajuku, Tsukigi market. There are tons to see and do and doesn't necessarily cost much.  We went on a 3 hour Tokyo Bay cruise that was $10 each person (yukata cruise, mostly young locals, super fun).  We did VR zone, well worth the long lines and the price of admission.

For a 2 person and 10 day trip, we spent less than $3k.  That is including airfare, accommodations, food, excursions, shopping (I did so much shopping), and souvenirs (I literally had an extra suitcase for souvenirs).  For some, that's just the cost of airfare alone. Just make sure to do your research. Japan was super fun!  

Enjoy your trip! "	"My SO and I are frugal on different things.  We made an agreement to not fight about money.

I've been doing that, but it hasn't helped. Not even slightly.

I'm unable to forgive myself for something I have no memory of, but that hurt somebody I loved and cared about so badly that she would choose to never talk to me again. If I knew what I'd said, even if it was something awful, I would at least have something to process; if I could tell myself, ""Those were terrible things for me to say. I shouldn't have said that."" But I can't because I don't even know. Maybe all I did was call her out for the lies and things that weren't adding up or maybe I thoroughly cussed her out or even insulted her. Maybe all of the above. 

Not knowing and only being able to guess while her silence makes me question everything, including whether or not I meant anything to her at all to be so thoroughly discarded, is maddening. So, too, is knowing that I was in bed and no more than a minute or two away from simply waking up the next day with a hangover. If I'd shut my phone off, if she'd texted me earlier in the evening, or **if I had never gotten drunk in the first place**. If only.

There are three types of accounts promoting Russian influence online:
Attributed accounts that clearly state they are pro-Russian or affiliated with the Russian government.

Accounts run by people around the world who amplify pro-Russian themes either knowingly or unknowingly, after being influenced by the efforts described above."""

These accounts were selected for their relationship to Russian-sponsored influence and disinformation campaigns, and not because of any domestic political content. The initial dashboard tracks 600 accounts that were 1) identified as participating in specific disinformation campaigns synchronized with Russia Today and Sputnik News, 2) meaningfully linked to users who self-identified as promoting pro-Russian viewpoints, and 3) bots that provide support to members of the first two categories.

Yes through a computer programme it would *simulate* these things but no oxygen is being taken out of the atmosphere for respiration of the simulated cell, the mass of the computer doesn't increase as the cell grows so it's not alive. There already exist very complex computational methods that allow us to simulate the big bang etc so simulating a cell would not be a challenge, I don't know of any personal examples though. 	"It will change its spin to be opposite of that in the sub-orbital. It does this relatively easily, because the spin of an electron can be thought of being like a magnet. The up spin of an adjacent electron will cause it to flip and have a down spin, the same way a magnet pointed north will flip the north of another magnet and make it face south. This is how MRI works, by using radio waves to change the spin of electrons in hydrogen atoms in your body. 

The Pauli exclusion principle states that no electron can have all the same 4 quantum numbers as another electron. If the principle were broken, it would mean that the two electrons are the same entity, which makes them indistinguishable and therefore impossible to be two separate objects. If this happened, a lot of forms of electron spectroscopy would not work. It is also why neutron stars cannot collapse past a certain point.

In terms of the fundamental mechanism of how the electron 'knows' to change spin, I speculate it has a lot to do with our understanding of how fundamental particles interact with each other, possible something to do with the strong force but I don't know tbh.

1031	I'd say 50k miles is a conservative estimate. If you're not an aggressive driver, you should be able to get another 100k out of it granted that some of the suspension bushings may need replacement by then. 	On my current cars, I can toss the oil pan under the car, unbolt the drain bolt, remove oil filter, and be done in 10 minutes after replacing the filter and filling it back up. For lowered cars, you could just jack one side up, put it on a jackstand, then you'll usually have enough clearance to toss the pan under the car. Second option without buying a jack stand or ramps would be to drive the car halfway along the sidewalk from the driveway so that one wheel is barely on the sidewalk and the other is on the road. I learned this trick from a friend and it works very well when I had a lower car and didn't feel like taking out all my tools. 	Frugal	Frugal	1

No they don't, in 1984 they get rid of all nuanced language and have single adjectives and adverbs for everything.  Avoiding improper use of a word/making up a word that doesn't exist is the opposite of that. The lack of acknowledgement of what the word actually means and using it in ways that don't fit the definition makes the word lose the nuance and have the same meaning as the similar, correct word.  Use and utilize don't have the same meaning. In 1984 they would have gotten rid to one of them because the meaning is similar.  Using them interchangeably actually gets closer to 1984's Newspeak than acknowledging that they're different and using them appropriately.    	cringepics	cringepics	1

It all depends on how you feel about certain characters.(Shallan mostly) Oathbringer is easily my favorite of the three because it focuses on Dalinar and offers the best ""Sanderson Avalanche"" of the three. If you're open to suggestions I'd recommend reading Warbreaker before Words of Radiance. It doesn't tie in directly but there's something at the end of WoR that you will aprreciate a lot if you read Warbreaker first. Plus Warbreaker is also really good.  Also, the Edgedancer novella before Oathbringer. Stormlight is one of my favorite series and I'm always glad to see other people enjoying it. Happy reading! 

Edit: If you don't read Warbreaker before WoR make sure you read it before Oathbringer. The connections between it and Sotrmlight become much stronger in Oathbringer. "	No. Edgedancer is a Sotrmlight Archives Novella and provides a lot of back story for one of the characters in Oathbringer. Warbreaker is in it's own world but it has significant ties to Stormlight in the latter half of WoR and in to Oathbringer.

1077	It doesn't matter if the intent is to be a punishment or not-Mary is still being *punished* or *harmed* by your suggestion to kick her out when she hasn't done anything. I hardly doubt that the other kids are so emotionally scarred by their aunt showing preferential treatment to their oldest sibling that OP needs to take such drastic measures. They still have 2 [assumed] loving parents and I really don't think a random aunt is going to cause them to feel totally unworthy. Your suggestion is clearly over the top and overly dramatic. OP can still show her other two children they are important and loved without kicking her kid out of the house. Good way to screw up OP's relationship with Mary. 	I know how to read, thanks, just don't agree with your comment at all. It's really shitty to alienate your own daughter and show favoritism to the other two just because her aunt treats her better. There is literally no reason OP should force her own child to move out. The only thing I've read that Mary did wrong was deny her parents a ride in HER car. Not really a reason to kick your kid out. This is OP's fault, not Mary's. 	relationships	relationships	1

The avg time spent there is 49 days it says.

You telling me I'm being selective but not providing any sources for counter arguments. Both articles I have linked back up these points. 

And how can you says that the temporary holding of children and their return to family members back in mexico is not how this works? Both articles under two administrations both cite this. How do you think deportation works? We just drop these kids off in the middle of nowhere mexico?

What your saying about a relative or sponsor in the US is a temporary place for the children to wait, much like these detention centers. They try and use foster homes to some extent, but these children are still sent back. Please go back through and read the report linked in the NPR article where they specifically discuss the deportation of these children during the Obama era

1087	"Improving yourself does not necessarily mean increasing your MMR.  You can definitely improve yourself while decreasing MMR.  For instance you might be focusing on improving one aspect of play, spending money for example, and lose because of scouting.  The opposite is easily true as well.  Balance changes in particular don't affect your ability to improve at all, although they might affect your *measurement* of your improvement.

I don't just mean that MMR is a noisy measure (which it is), but that it has no absolute scale.  It is entirely dependent on outside factors (balance, other players' skill levels, etc).  If everyone else magically became 2x better at the game except you, your MMR would decrease.  But that doesn't mean that your skill level decreased, only that others improved.

Similarly, if for instance Terran was balanced and then became completely underpowered, Terran players would lose MMR because of this change.  However, this MMR change is completely indistinguishable from the case where Terran was completely overpowered and then became balanced."	"I would argue that it doesn't take that much skill to defend a cheese used by a player with little skill.  Cheese has usually been presented as something that works if not scouted, but doesn't work if scouted.  Scouting a cheese is not particularly difficult, but a lot of people simply choose to cut that corner.

Now the person executing the cheese does usually have more experience with the situation, but that just means that that person is more skilled in this one aspect of the game because he encounters it much more often.  Printf, for instance, has practiced his cannon rushes to the point where he can win in GM with them.  His ability to play a macro game may not be quite that high, but almost no other players would be able to do what he does consistently.

All races have ways to identify and defend against drops.  Sensor towers are very important in TvT for this reason.  Mirror matches are nice to look at because both players have the same opportunities.

1091	"&gt; People with no degree, skills, or experience are making $1200/mo on the government. We yell at them to get jobs. The jobs available to them are minimum wage jobs making $600/mo. That's unacceptable. Why would they take a pay cut.

Which government programs are you thinking of? Because most programs work on a sliding scale that ensures that going from no earned income to sub-poverty income *does not* result in a loss in total income. In the situation you describe, it's more likely that their $1,200 benefits become $800 benefits, making their total income $1,400 a month, meaning finding and maintaining work is still worthwhile.

Now that said, there ***is*** a problem with a steep cliff once people get over the poverty line. Making one dollar under poverty qualifies you for a whole bunch of government programs, meaning hundreds of dollars in assistance. Making one dollar over completely disqualifies you from these same programs, meaning a pay raise, increase in work hours, or second job *can* result in a loss of total income. The answer to this issue however is not cutting people off, it's designing the program to have more of a slope that tapers off as opposed to a cliff that we force people to *drop* off of. To advocate for this however is political suicide. Voters do not like the idea of supporting people who are not living in poverty (which is an arbitrary line that we draw anyways) and do not want to see the percent of people using these benefits skyrocket, even though the total amount paid by the programs would only increase marginally to cover these people."	"I'm not seeing your point with the comparison. Yes, a person with *no income* should get more money than someone who *has* an income. Was this person taking advantage of the situation? Possibly. But someone else in her position who was fighting tooth and nail to even *get* a job does deserve significantly more a month in food assistance, I believe.

The gender disparity in the Food Stamps program mostly stems from the fact that having children at home makes it significantly easier to qualify for the program and qualifies you to receive a lot more. In our society, women bear this burden much more frequently than men. A woman is subject to the exact same formula and receives the exact same payout as a man, assuming that all else is equal (income, cost of home/food/clothing, dependents, etc.).

I'll agree that the program is *fucked* when it comes to determining what is/is not a ""necessity."" No doubt that car insurance is a necessity of life if you live outside of NYC or LA or another city with a similarly robust public transit system. Unfortunately though, the people who make benefits determinations are subject to strict rules regarding what does/does not count as a necessity.

Anyways, the last time before today I got to 295 (on a 1s week of course), I managed 3 reps. Decided to lower mt TM a few cycles, eventually got back to 295, and I don't even think managed 2 this time. This was probably a few months ago. I decided it was time to cut at that point so I did, and since starting up this next bulk cycle, here I am at 295 DL today again and barely managed 4 reps (really got 3, but took a 10-15 second break after rep 3 and barely managed to squeeze out 4, didn't even try 5). What's more discouraging is just last week, 3s week at 280, I managed 8, and managed 10 at 265 2 weeks ago. I don't think today was a bad day either because I managed 135x5 OHP (I OHP &amp; DL the same days) which was definitely a best for me. I don't think recovery is a problem either as I took the past 4 days completely off from the gym due to a minor non-gym related injury that is fully recovered today.

What can I do at this point besides lowering my TM again? Is 295 just some prison I'm stuck in? My other lifts (bench, squat, etc.) are progressing fairly well.

I see people posting here saying you should be getting at least 10/8/5 on your 5/3/1+ sets which is why I am asking for advice

Eckersely may have been the first modern closer with gaudy numbers but he didn't start posting those numbers until the second half of his career. I'm not saying that Eckersley isn't an all time great, I'm saying that it is harder for newcomers like the op to recognize his greatness because of modest career save totals relative to the all-timers in this category. Hence the op implying that Eckersley is ``overshadowed'' by Rivera and what I am assuming is Hoffman.

Again, I am not claiming that Eckersley is left in the dust by Rivera. I am claiming that his measurable statistics do not reflect his actual dominance, so that the perceived distance between him and Rivera is closer than what it appears on paper.

1109	"Sure, but that doesn't disprove the overall trend.  In the 2017 Fortune 500, [there were only 32 female CEOs, or 6.4% of CEOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_women_CEOs_of_Fortune_500_companies).  And by my count, less than half of those listed would be considered as traditional tech companies or even STEM companies.

Also, the point of citing Susan Fowler's case isn't just about gender diversity in higher ranks; it's also about pointing out the harassment that women have to face in tech when they're there.  Just because a few companies have female CEOs doesn't mean that the harassment has gone away completely from the industry at large."	"1. Not all jobs are created equal in terms of ability to progress up the economic ladder (or in simpler terms, ability to pay the bills).  Hairdressing has a much larger and, therefore, more competitive labor pool than engineering does.  As a result, opportunities to earn more money are limited--supply and demand, and all that.  I'd posit that if you gave a man or a woman the choice between being an engineer and being a hairdresser with the constraint that they'd be equally happy and capable in either job, they'd go for the engineering role just because it yields more money.
2. Women not being in STEM fields leads to a negative feedback loop in which women are falsely perceived as being incapable of thriving in STEM fields.  That, in turn, hurts women who *do* want to be in STEM fields as well as the ones that are already there (I'd also throw in that it hurts our perception of women in society in general).  Nobody bats an eye when women become nurses, doctors, politicians, even businesspeople and lawyers, and yet all of a sudden, when we talk about STEM jobs, people think it's not for women?  In a world where Grace Hopper was one of the original pioneers of computer programming and where a book and film (*Hidden Figures*) were made about black female STEM workers who contributed to the space program?

If 300 redditors posted disagreeing with me would this make me wrong?

Should we not ask where the beliefs of those 300 people come from? Do cultural differences have any impact on what they construe as bullying? Do age differences? Do occupational differences? Does state of mind? Can we be sure those 300 people are even real?

Lets look at sexual harrasment. Maybe women are underreporting sexual harrasment because they do not believe a particular act counts as harrassment. Perphaps culturally it is considered ok? Would someone born 50 years ago think act X was sexual harrasment? Did their mood that day make them pass it off as nothing? Are they too scared to say they have been sexually harrased?

I dont want to waste your time because i know its precious, if its not your domain of activity or future one, i will say before the main word of this business ideea ""crypto"".

I want to change my life somehow doing big things since i was 15 years old, i start working since i was 11 years old and for me its enough, i hate depend by a boss who give me small amount of money, in the early 20s i decide to be professional poker player and this is what i am today. I know its hard to be millionaire from this job and i know i can to better and earn more money from other domains, some people will say many words about poker, but i started as a last shot to have something to eat and to do something legal because with 200-400 euros salary you cant pay doctors for your grandmothers 8 years to do chimiotherapy, different surgery for example.

I have few ideeas of business but this one its one of the greatest, i have some knowledge about it because before starting playing poker at 22 years old i have worked with people from this proposal business ideea and i know the psychology of the customers and they will be your customers, crypto will go hand in hand with your activity.

What this business brings you on the table and how you will grow it, from where you will get money and how you will you have an impact in the modern economy:

-commission from crypto tranzactions made by users
-big amount of money from the crypto owners who wants to raise their price level of their coin and be part of this business.(imagine here what sums we talking about). They will search you for staying at the table with you.
-you will do crypto coins beeing more used than their are in this moment
-its in everybody interests

Also here i have more interesting lines about how you win but i dont say anymore because beeing m/billionaire its not like you dont have brain to figure out what its all about, but you will win big from it.

Some people will say im crazy, maybe i am, but this is my price, 100 millions euro, 60 before, 40 after.

I offer you discrestion, exclusivity and the chance to be the first doing this because more will follow you, i am a man of honor and for me money its a bit like paper but i dont want to spend my rest of my life in rush for them because i need money for eating, growing my kids, offer them a future, traveling with my wife and most important thing, i want money for health, mine and beloved ones, for example when i write this words, my grandmother who grown me my entire life until 25-26 years doesnt have more than 2 weeks to live, all the doctors said that, my wife's mother have also a malignant tumor and my mother worked her entire life to put food on our table and doesnt feel so well with blood pressure, sugar in blood and so on. My dad died at 33 years old when i was kid and my grandfather 13 years ago not having money to give him a chance. I want my family close to me because they spent over 20 years working in another countries.

Late edit after discussions from private:

We need to create a platform like KuCoin or Cryptopia where people can add to their wallets different types or coins accepted by us totaly safe and legit. Simple to accept them all like a normal EXCHANGE.
An exchange its useful and can be a bonus to this platform,this is not the main job of this platform, we have other goals. We can take commissions from withdraws, small ones and we can give them other opportunities /skyline/shight/view.




Another late edit:
I did some research and the closest website/platform one who can have a good infracstructure good for ours its KuCoin and Cryptopia, i believe are more but not so safe and legit that those are. We create an enviroment where people put their coins, exchange them if neccessary to use our service. The money comes from exchange, withdraws, my ideea(the service) and from cryptocoin owners(developers,bosses) who wants to grown their price and made them more reliable/useful.
Also we can give exclusivity to some specific coins to be used in our service and this can helps to bring more money from people who wants that exclusivity."

Is Bell ultra talented and the best RB in the NFL? yes. But you don’t need an elite RB to win a Super Bowl. Most teams that have won the Super Bowl don’t have 1 elite back, they have 2, maybe 3 solid-good backs they use in rotation.  I think Connor and Samuels, with the OL we have will be sufficient. Provided the new OC schemes properly. The good news is, nobody has game tape on the new OC. Never seen him call plays or his schemes, so that works in our benefit, at least this year.


I’m not saying Samuels is as talented as Bell and yes he was a 5th round pick. But did the Steelers see him as Bells replacement? They’re very similar in skill set, both being able to play WR and RB. Also both nearly identical in height, weight and speed:

Bell: 6”1 - 225lbs  - 4.60 40 yard dash 

Samuels: 6”0 - 223lbs - 4.54 40 yard dash

That’s too many coincidences to me for them not to view him as a potential Bell replacement. Their play style and skill set on tape is similar too.

You fail to understand that the IT field has grown significantly in difficulty and complexity in that time, and that *while 20 years ago* it wasn’t a median skills field, the skills requirements of yesteryear pale in comparison to the skills requirements of today.

Not only have IT wages not grown enough to outpace inflation in some areas, but the jobs of today require a much more broad and complex skillset. The education and training required to access these jobs is more expensive than its ever been, and we’re not being compensated for them.

And before you say that the field isn’t worthwhile and those who are bitching should leave the field: consider that IT is the *singular* reason for modern society. If we go, you go.

1128	"This field of research tends to be rely on evolutionary models for explaining responses to the smell of other people. In short, a lot of information is conveyed via [pheromones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone) and our brains have evolved mechanisms to detect and respond to such information in adaptive ways.

Surely the brain learns to associate artificial fragrances with all kinds of stuff (e.g., *oh, this reminds me of the perfume my grandmother wore*), but responses like the ones outlined in this paper tend to indicate that this is an evolved mechanism. 

EDIT: Since I got a couple responses stating that [there's little evidence for the existence of human pheromones](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/do-human-pheromones-actually-exist), I just want to point out that the use of the term ""pheromone"" in that article is using one of the strictest definitions of the term. In actuality, pheromones could include a much broader set of chemicals and effects than what is implied in the Science Magazine article. The authors of [the study they were reporting](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/4/3/160831.full.pdf) were only studying **sex** pheromones and they point out in the first paragraph that there is much debate about how narrowly the term should be used. The only thing that these authors found was that there is little evidence that androstadienone and estratetraenol are sex pheromones with *direct* effects on perceptions of gender, attractiveness, and probability of remaining faithful. That's it. They made no claim that this should be interpreted as (lack of) evidence for ""pheromones"" in general. In fact, this comes directly from the research article: **""[...]it is likely there are other chemicals secreted
by humans that are currently unknown but that may function as pheromones.""** The claim I'm making is totally consistent with what these researchers found and with how these researchers interpret what they found.

So, I agree that there is weak evidence for the existence of any *specific* sex pheromone affecting humans in a straightforward way, but the idea that the smell of other people can influence cognition and behavior is an idea with much more support. Again, there is *a lot* of information carried in the scents of other people and we need *way* more research to justify a claim like ""human pheromones don't exist."" Things get extremely complex when talking about combinations of chemicals and a single study of two chemicals is hardly enough to justify the title of that Science Magazine article."

1144	"&gt; Yusuf Ali 5:32 - On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although (وَلَقَدْ) there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet (thumma ثُمَّ), even after that (بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ) many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why I'm saying it is not the thumma making the sequence.

It's obviously a sequential event. You could as easily translate it as ""then, after that"".

&gt;There is no doubt that ""thumma"" is generally used for sequence, but it's just like how the word ""date"" is usually talking about the day, month and year, but can also mean the fruit.

Seems to be a pretty rare thing, given the lack of obvious examples. To me, it seems as though the Quran is saying ""A happened on this date"" and you're arguing that it literally happened on a piece of fruit. It might be a possible use of the language, but there's no evidence suggesting the language was used like that.

&gt;Where are you viewing these translations? 5/10 of the ones on quran.com don't imply sequence.

The only translation that can't be read sequentially is Yusuf's. In context, I think it's clearly sequential. It's alluding to the story of Moses, and the polytheists, yes?

&gt;Some translations are better than others. We aren't like Christians in believing all translations are equal, because the one true Qur'an is the Arabic. This is why nobody can just pick up a Qur'an and understand its nuances the first time, it's an ancient document requiring exegesis.

Yes, and I don't think there's good evidence that ancient Arabic had this use of ""thumma"".

&gt;But it makes no sense to be telling the Muslims to say something, then after they speak, God gives something to a man dead for centuries.

In the previous verse it says ""This is what He has commanded you"". God commanded the Jews before Moses. And then in the next verse it says ""Then, we gave Moses the book"". It's a reminder to the Jews that they have no reason not to follow God because they were given his words. First, he commanded them to follow His path. Then, He gave them the book.

Nobody argues that Moses brought the book down before the Jews were commanded to follow God. This whole section is an answer to the excuses of the Jews, yes? Eg. 

&gt;""So that you may not say, ""Surely the Book was sent down only upon two sections even before us, and decidedly we have indeed been heedless of their study.""

Here, God is talking about the different times at which he has revealed his laws, so that the Jews have no excuse. "	"&gt;Because I believe my religious beliefs are true, from evidence I feel is just as strong as evolution

Cannabis users are more likely to be heavy drinkers than non-users.

   ""Thou shalt not kill."" ""Let he who has not sinned cast the first stone."" - Harry Potter?
""Let he who is without sin cast the first spell!""

I do not think of Jesus as a metaphor.  I do not think of Jesus as either of such things.  I remember how he told people to forgive and love your enemy, I don't think anything is stronger than that. ""Forgive, and you will be forgiven.""  That is what I think of when I think of Jesus."	"&gt; What exactly is YOUR end game here? What goal are you looking to achieve? Blind devotion to SELFISH CULTS INTENT ON KEEPING THEIR FOLLOWERS IGNORANT?

   No. I was trying to point out the contradiction in your two statements, at least from a moral 'what we should do' point of view.  I was arguing the opposite.
   If guilt causes evil, what is the value of guilt?  Cast aside that which causes evil. Or, biblically, if your hand causes you to sin... (that part I do think is a metaphor... probably)

   I disagree that guilt over the death of christ causes evil and blind devotion.  I also oppose ignorance.  Those who have the truth have no need to keep their followers in ignorance.  Whether we feel guilty over christ, or not, the truth sets us free (from Ignorance, and more).  God is the God of truth. (Isiah 65:16)
   HOWEVER, 'IF' and this is an if, IF guilt is a cause of evil then we should avoid it. IF! 

&gt;A metaphorical/figurative resurrection is a resurrection that didn't happen in any way, shape or form whatsoever? Is that what you're saying here?

  That would appear to be the linguistic interpretation I draw from what you have said, let me know if I am wrong and if you believe in an actual literal resurrection of Christ from the dead after 3 days and into heaven.  If he was actually walking around with a hole in his side and holes in his hand after the resurrection. (Wait... Christ wasn't made whole like those who are resurrected will be, interesting).

&gt; he'd be living happy up in heaven ruling the universe.  

   Yes, that is (in essence) what I believe. However, if you are insinuating that Christ was somehow rewarded, no, that is not what I believe. He returned to his natural place, so in that sense he wasn't rewarded, simply returned to where he belonged, the death and suffering that he did not have to endure was the additional part, paid for us.  Him being in heaven is right and just, him dying, suffering, and being rejected is not.  That is what he paid for us.

&gt;John 14:48 You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
 
I am saying that the resurrection is a true literal event.  Metaphors are linguistic figures of speech in storytelling, to drag the word 'metaphor' and 'parable' in is a bit unclear by the definition, I am simply saying that the resurrection is a true literal event.  I think Paul's letters do not imply or assert Christ as non-literal.

 Christ used parables, but that does not mean he was one. Christ told stories with metaphors, but that does not mean he was one.

 The story of Audie Murphy is very inspirational, but the actual story is his account of an actual real event, not a parable, not a metaphor, an accounting of events.

&gt;&gt; Can a metaphor create the universe? Can a metaphor save anyone from death?
&gt; Yes.

No! That is a very impressive metaphor.  I am not arguing in the inspiration of civilization or the building up of history, I am talking about the literal creation of the universe, the formation of atoms and fundamental building blocks.  Did a metaphor create Jupiter? 

A metaphor is a figure of speech. a parable is a story. Can either of those stop Jupiter in a second? (I had to go big for simplicity)
  
Metaphor: a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.
Parable: a simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson, as told by Jesus in the Gospels.

Neither of those can pick up a rock and throw it, much less create the sun.

&gt; As a secular Christian, none. It's all metaphor and parable.

Let's reduce this a bit (simplify it), the term 'metaphor' and 'parable' aren't really helpful.  Question, do you believe that the resurrection of Jesus christ actually, literally, occurred.  Did he die and rise again?  Will you as a flesh-and-blood breathing human being?  My memory is not me, I have a pulse, my memory does not, it's not who I am, I believe we will VERY LITERALLY be resurrected from DEATH by the power of God through Christ. 

Question(Intended rhetorically, but I'll accept answers): Can you name one Christian born after Christ but before 300AD whose name is not recorded therein or in any historical documents. Can you ask Paul who ""lives on in memory""? Name a Christian tailor who lived in ancient Rome.  Tell me your great-grandfathers favorite color.  If he 'lives' in memory, ask him.  By life, I mean life. By lives, I mean lives and breathes. To live on in memory is a figure of speech, an idiom.  To equate what I mean to what you mean is a fallacy of equivocation.

The same can be said of our definitions of God. It's not what Christ offered, nor is it anything I care about.  If being remembered is the reward, why pray in secret? (Matthew 6:6).

What I define as God, is very REAL, he would exist without words, without memory, without us, he would still exist. He existed before anything else, and he would continue to exist even if every book were erased and every mind rendered blank, and even if I didn't define him.  If every man on this planet perished God could still raise them all up with less effort than it takes me to draw breath, and he could flood the world if he hadn't promised not to.

&gt; If helping people is a sin, I don't want to meet God.

Helping people is not a sin, and if that is all you've done in your life, I'm impressed.

&gt; If a miraculous pit of fire and torture are waiting for me, I'll gladly suffer knowing an evil God is responsible for my pain, and what I did in life is a thing I am proud of.

God is not evil. Suffering is earned. Helping people is not a sin (have you really not sinned?). An evil God wouldn't allow you to confess your sins and be forgiven. (John 20:23)  An evil God wouldn't spare the world for a few righteous who could be saved and command them to save one another, thus saving as many as he could.  An evil God wouldn't warn Adam and Eve before the fall, he'd simply laugh at their misfortune.

"I know I *should* be advising with Bible passages, but, to be completely honest, they've never been particularly helpful to me for issues like this. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot they are good for, but aside from Ecclesiastes nothing in it really seems to grapple with existentialism. It's later theologians and (frequently Christian) philosophers who discuss the anticipatory challenges we must overcome before we can actualize to a point at which the advice in the Bible makes a meaningful impact.

For example, Matthew 18:15 is great for mending a relationship, but I haven't found a verse that can motivate you to do the thing; They provide means but no motivation- What merit does this end have over that one? Is there some sort universal tragedy if some ass grows apart from? If so, how so, when I and he are ultimately inconsequential?

There's a burning drive to explain everything with the self consistency and rigidity of a mathematical proof, but some things remain mysterious- Impervious to Earthly explanation. Harder and harder to believe when we can say with confidence the composition of stars and the behavior of atoms, but the Truth is that mysteries abound wherever you look, and that in the face of them, some choices are easy for our guts to make, even as our brains flail for meaning.

Why do strawberries taste good? Because they taste good, what more reason does a thing need? Why must everything have an ironclad chain of reason?

As for the specific mystery of the shape of death, I recommend the remarks of Twain and Epicurus: 

 &gt; I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.
 --Mark Twain

 &gt; Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist.
--Epicurus

As God's Elect we have an eternity to grapple with post-existence- An eternity in the presence of The Father. Who better to console our fears with an explanation? We ought not let tomorrow's lessons detract from today's chores. 

It doesn't keep the mind from wandering, though. Here's what I reckon, inspired by CS Lewis; You don't have a Soul, You ARE a Soul, you HAVE a Body. If we are not the meatsacks that hold us, then perhaps we are patterns of behavior. Perhaps some level of reincarnation really is at work (I've seen no explicit denial), and there's only a few of us, tried again and again in this suit and that one. The eternal aspect isn't our hair color or shoe size, it's our pattern of thought which God can use ever after.

For example, a cover of a song or brand of humor visited on a topic. My earthly existence was the theatrical cut of a movie, but ever after God will be entertained by the Director's Cut, reruns, crossover episodes of His own design. This is how Mortals perceive Immortality on Earth; Hitchcock, from beyond the grave, continues to influence film. Bach's influence on music persists. Maybe that's what God will use from us; ""This is how Chris made pancakes on Earth, and they were basically perfect, so this is how we make pancakes in Heaven.""

Nobody I've ever shared that with seems particularly keen on that version of Heaven, which is fine, because I don't have any reason to think my prediction is any better than theirs. Maybe mine will change- I'm 26 and death seems distant. But whatever I imagine it to be won't change the Truth- It's a Mystery by God's Design, and is ultimately irrelevant.

It's kind of a shout back at the Universe; ""I'm pointless and irrelevant? Fuck you, YOU'RE pointless and irrelevant, see if I care! I know what I'm about and unbothered by my ignorance of your pointless mysteries."" You don't owe the Universe an explanation, and it doesn't owe you one. You owe *yourself* a purpose, and you're the only one who has to be satisfied with it.

On the monopoly: this is not wrong, unfortunately. First off, Activision decides prices in other platforms (even regional pricing), so there's no pricing issue. The playerbase's user experience isn't affected, since any functionalities are inherent to the game, not necessarily the platform.

At *most* it is s convenience issue. It isn't convenient to open Battle.net, when I usually just open Steam. Linking them, imo, is bad: I hate having to open uPlay every time I run R6 on Steam for instance.

"&gt; If nationality is only relevant user profile pages, why would I be joining into the nationality tables in other features? Each of my users has a lot of different pieces of data associated with them (posts, reports, personal application preferences, friends, replies, messages, etc.). The notion that I have to join into every single one of these when loading every single page in a large feature is plainly false.

How do you treat partially loaded users in your code then? You've got the `if exists(repo.hasTeams)` problem only much more widespread and impossible to ever fix.

&gt; ?

That way you'll get users with only their German nationality even if they actually have multiple nationalities. If you then modify those users and update, it would be very easy to accidentally remove their other nationalities.

&gt; Actually you don't have to do anything. Your database does it for you.

It does, as part of your write, and you have no direct control over it. Writes too slow because of your index updates? Too bad, buy a bigger server.

&gt; With NoSQL you either need to be absolutely sure that you are always either updating users through a common abstraction that handles index updates, or calling your user index update immediately after your user record update unless you can tolerate your indexes becoming out of sync.

Or you have your index building pipeline feeding from your user pipeline, so any written users will become part of the index. You end up doing the same thing an RDBMS would be doing behind the scenes (because RDBMSes are fundamentally good engineering and the whole field converges on the same solutions to the same problems), but with more visibility and control over it, and without having to fake a model that doesn't fit. (E.g. any serious RDBMS these days will use MVCC, so your long-running report is actually operating on a snapshot of what your table used to look like - which is what you want - but most won't give you direct visibility and control over that snapshot because the RDBMS interface requires them to pretend that the table is a single thing being mutated in place).

&gt; With SQL you can also plan for large operations (be it schema changes or long running reports).

Up to a point. The tooling and visibility around these things is distinctly secondary, in my experience; they're expected to be rare, so they're less first-class; even if the database itself has good support, the language APIs probably won't. Whereas a NoSQL system absolutely needs to have a good interface for aggregation jobs.

Theoretically you could do everything I've been advocating in a traditional RDBMS - append-only event tables for all your raw input, materialised views for all your intermediate pipelines (and then you achieve a ""schema change"" in a smoother way by creating the new view, migrating things to it, and eventually dropping the old one), indices, and aggregations, and there's usually some kind of interface for running a slow report at a low priority without proper transaction isolation when you don't want it to interfere with live updates. But you're going against the grain, and you're giving up most of the advantages that the RDBMS was supposed to give you - e.g. if you're using a materialised view as a manual ""index table"" (which is the solution I've seen to ""I want index updates to happen eventually, but not block the live transaction"") then the query planner can no longer choose whether to use your index for ad-hoc queries, you have to decide explicitly anyway. At some point the RDBMS side of things is costing you more than you gain.

&gt; Write and run the code to do it, and NoSQL will happily accept just about any operation at any time.

Sure, but the code is forced to be much clearer about what it's doing. In SQL a table scan looks exactly the same as a pkey lookup, an unindexed join looks exactly the same as an indexed join..."	programming	programming	1

1194	"Constant light density is not the same as total light.  It is total light from a subject that determines how much detail and noise we see in an image.
Please read the whole article I referenced.  See also [understanding exposure](http://www.clarkvision.com/articles/exposure/).

&gt; Both produce the same illumination of the sensor, meaning the same amount of light per area. Which is why mounting said 80/5.6 on a crop camera won't produce a brighter image.

Really?  Then compare [Figures 2a and 2b here](http://www.clarkvision.com/articles/characteristics-of-best-cameras-and-lenses-for-nightscape-astro-photography/), comparing two images made at f/2.8 with 15 mm and 35 mm lenses.  Why is the 35 mm image brighter and showing fainter stars?  Figure 3a shows full resolution crops.

The answer is basic physics: the larger aperture diameter lens collects more light."	"Really?  Please read the OP's post.  He says nothing about pixels or general image quality.  It is specifically about low light:

""I always see people not recommend M43 or APS-C because FF's bigger sensor lets in low light, ...""

Collecting light is the key to low light because the S/N we see is the square root of the total light collected from a subject.    In your Andromeda galaxy example, collecting more light from stars in a larger field of view does not help image quality of the galaxy itself.  People perceive images of subject(s) not pixels or large fields of view that are not relevant to the subject.

I think you as a woman should tell men to keep the seat down and I am a man.  The reason is that the seat being able to go up was designed and meant to make it easier to clean your toilet. It's never meant for men to lift it up to take a piss.  i  put it down because I agree with women that it should be kept down. it's a seat which is meant to be down. I think it's great you don't mind and seems you are mostly drama free which guys like.  However, for me at least you sound more like a guy and I would love to be friends with you but us guys normally like women being helpless and needing us to open cans and stuff even though we know they can do it themselves. I just at least for me gives me a warm feeling inside.  	we as guys look for women being more girly like naturing and  not doing guy things. If you do guy things it makes us feel like you're a dude. straight guys won't be interested in you as a potential mate / date.  However, as a friend sure and we think it's awesome. However, we won't get turned on but it depends on individual guys. For me at least i  would be friends with you  but I  don't think we can be gf and bf. Just saying I would date you just to see what happens but mentally in my head thinking about this scenario  would not get me turned on or sexually interested but mentally my mind would be like this is a dude even though I know it's not but subconsiously I would. There was a lady at work that lifts weights as a hobby. she has those manly arms and me and other guys totally said oh who would date that dude there.. lol  some said she's becoming a man.  the lady wasn't married and at the office guys talk about who would even date her.  I am not putting you down. I am saying also it depends how you look. If you look feminine like weak arms or soft squeeshy arms  and you look ok or cute then forget what I just said and I would date you in a heart beat. I mean those qualities are great by itself but your looks have a role to it. If you look or rub a certain way that gives me a feeling you're more of a guy  physically looking and the way you act then it's a turn off.  My point is that you want to avoid giving too many vibes to men that you seem to look and act like a man.

It's a legitimate issue for a lot of PC players. Hell I played rdr and I'm not hyped for it's sequel. Mainly because I won't reward rockstars greed. All that comment said was that they can't be hyped for something that haven't played. You proceeded to tell them that it ""must suck to have only one platform to play on"".

I'm not gonna pop up and chime in because someone has a legitimate reason of their own to do so. Just like the player above may have as well. He certainly has a legitimate reason for not playing rdr because rockstar continues to play will they won't they in regards to PC releases. Which is even more laughable when more and more Japanese devs are bringing their games to pc every day. We got monster Hunter, yakuza, dragon quest and all kinds of new Japanese ips. 

My mistake in regards to that last quote since I'm replying from my phone. I meant to say I'm not brushing aside rdr. It is legitimately a great game.

1235	When I say my benefits. It’s the whole package that my company pays the union for me. So I get paid my hourly rate which is $20/hr and then in my union contract the company pays for me a plethora of other things. Which includes health, dental, 2 different retirement plans. It adds up quickly. And yes. And apprenticeship in Kansas City. Everything thing that is in my whole package is broken down and I can see where every penny of my package goes. It’s a pretty sweet deal. It’s one of the big benefits, in my opinion, of a union.	It’s not terribly hard at all. I mean, yes, it has its days where you do a decent amount of physical labor, but that’s in new construction. And then there are days where all I do is wire up switches and outlets. Which IMO, is very easy. So it does have its day on a construction site that can be strenuous, but over all, it’s not super hard. But, moving on from just the basics, there is a lot that you need to know. You must know codes for buildings, codes for wiring thing, and of course fire prevention codes. Cause if you wire something wrong, you can start a fire pretty easily. Over all I’d say I like it a lot. I mean, I’m 20 y.o. And making $20/hr with full benefits and starting a 401k already and all I’ve payed this far for school is $600. That’s for code books and helpful books for different things we do. And over the next 5 years I get a raise after each year of schooling up until I turn out into a journeyman wireman making, currently, $38 and some change per hour. So it’s something that takes a while to peak out at, but is very good once you do. And mind you, I am union.

Dedicated tools for the specific things you need to do. The best place I worked used maven for building, vagrant for spinning up VMs, puppet for getting the right dependencies on them (integrated with vagrant) and fabric for doing deployments, which sounds like a lot of complexity but it was actually really easy to work with because each tool had one job and you just had to do one command for each task.

The other thing is to just ""don't do that then"". E.g. rather than calling an external tool in your build process, bundle that tool up as a maven plugin - it's much easier than you might think. (Worst case the plugin can just shell out to the external tool and then at least it's properly integrated into your build and you can have a test suite for your plugin that makes sure error-prone stuff like output parsing works correctly)"	"I don't think it's about Scala 3, if anything I'd guess people have been pulled away by Kotlin.

For someone who weighs twice as much as me, they would need 4 doses to feel the same effect.

Now, maybe weed in the 1970s, which might have been 5% THC, wouldn't make brownies that would do this to a person. 3.5g of weed that is 5% THC has 175mg of THC in it. The standard dose of an edible in Colorado is 10mg. 175mg of THC is 17.5 doses. Divided into 15 pieces, that's 11.7mg THC per brownie, a little over 10mg.

1g of weed that is 20% THC has 200mg of THC in it. That's enough for 20 pieces with 10mg each.

What I'm wondering is where the OP got the idea that he needed to use a whole eighth of weed for one pan of brownies. It might be common to turn a whole eighth into marijuana butter, but that doesn't mean you should use all the marijuana butter at once for one pan of brownies. If he would have used 1/3rd of the butter he made, he would have been fine. Save the rest of the butter for later."	tifu	tifu	1

In my mind skills at an instrument have to be combined with song writing and influence to reach that level. 

Lightning Hopkins, Elmore James, Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, Albert King, BB King, Robert Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Blind Willy Johnson, Son House, Eric Clapton,  Rory Gallagher, T Bone Walker,  Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, RL Burnside, JR Kimbrough, Leadbelly, Skip James, Rev. Gary Davis, Jimmy Reed, Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, Mike Bloomfield, Johnny Winter, Taj Mahal, Keb Mo.

Is he a better technical  guitarist than some on that list, absolutely. 

But do you think he has inflenced and progressed the genre at much as any of these people? I could easily double that list, and I still think he would not be on it. 

Maybe Mayer will get there, but from what I have seen he is not there yet. But I will listen to more of his work, and try and be less of a smug judgemental asshole.
"	"It did not touch me, but that is probably because of preconceptions and bias. I made a snap judgement, chose my words poorly, and came off an asshole, which admittedly I can be.

I listened to more of his work, and he is undoubtedly an amazing technical guitarist. He is a virtuoso.

But I don't yet see him having the influence in the genre of the blues to be considered one of the all time greats. In time maybe, but as of yet he is an incredibly skilled man who plays very wall across many genres"	videos	videos	1

1257	I like your approach, friend, and I see what you're getting at, however, in the end, I do not believe in 'vacuum of space.' I do not believe we are on a globe floating in empty space. This is why I can't see a relevant connection between how crossbows work on earth vs rockets moving in 'vacuum of space.' 	"&gt;What about my first question : Why is there a recoil when you are shooting a crossbow ?

My guess is the tension of the string on the bow's limbs from loading. 

&gt;I believe rockets work on the principle that gives us recoil in a crossbow. I wanted to see how you think crossbows work.

I'm not sure if it's apples to apples though. It's a different scenario when we're talking about a serious vacuum such as 'space.' According to my research, we do not have the capability to reproduce this vacuum here on earth and it makes sense as to why we can't...because it isn't 'infinite space.'

1258	"&gt;This is absurd on its face. The ""purpose"" of having genitals is the same as the purpose of having a body. It is to be a human being. Part of being a human being is experiencing its sensual nature, alone and with others. 

This doesn't gain you any philosophical ground. What you are saying here is just something like, ""the essence of being human is doing whatever it is that humans do.""

That just ignores the critical part of the argument. The critical part of the argument—the part an opponent of it needs to address—is that a man who only achieves sexual release with a woman that he knows and loves enjoys a control upon his libido that is mediated by his concern and respect for the other. That is productive of virtue. A man who masturbates to porn whenever he wishes enjoys no control upon his libido; in fact, his pursuit of personal gratification must eclipse his concern and respect for the other—so long as we allow the quite uncontroversial postulate that being a pornographic actress is a far worse use of sex than having a monogamous loving relationship with one person that leads to a family. 

&gt;This embeds in the statement the pernicious idea that homosexuallity is some kind of deviant condition, rather than a perfectly normal state of affairs, which is yet another point that the Church has to answer for!

The arguments for the moral badness of homosexuality are better, I think, than those for the moral badness of masturbation. But I am not going to pursue this here. I would prefer to stay on topic.

&gt;Masturbation is almost always coupled with pornography abuse.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;You manage to commit three distinct logical fallacies in this one sentence... bravo?

A logical fallacy is not a statement you disagree with. Name the three fallacies purportedly committed in my statement. I wager you cannot because my statement is fairly straightforward: Most people who masturbate do so to porn. The word ""abuse"" would only be controversial if it were the default position that pornography use is morally good. And *that* is not the default moral position. Per contra.

&gt;I'm heartened to see pornography becoming less of a taboo topic and for companies like Pornhub starting to take porn further into the mainstream.

No one is interested in hearing about your enjoyment of porn. You need to argue that it is not morally bad—that is does not injure the dignity of its participants and that it does not impede the eudemonic fulfilment of human sexuality in monogamous romantic love and family. I have given arguments for my position. Where are your arguments for yours?

1272	"My concern is given the scenario I propose and the studies done before, prop 10 seems like it would reduce supply of rental units, thus increasing rent prices.

I think we're generally in agreement, but there are things that need to happen before or alongside this proposition. Otherwise, there could be really bad side effects. "	"When considering things like this, I like to think of the worst way it could go wrong.

So... how would you account for or address the following scenario:

1. Corporate developers and landlords see their bottom line impacted by these rent control limits.

2. They turn all of their existing units into condominiums to sell, and do not renew the rental leases of their current occupants.

3. They use the money from the condos they sell to buy cheaper apartment units in poorer areas, and bump up rent prices to account for the rent control limitations.

4. The supply of cheaper rental units tanks. New supply is priced higher in poorer areas.

5. Rental prices and property values increase in these poorer areas, accelerating gentrification.

6. Suddenly, the poor and/or disenfranchised population you hoped to help find themselves in a weird situation. Their rent may be controlled, but if their landlord ever decides to sell or not renew their leases, they have no options, as they're priced out of their area and displaced. Property values and rent prices are now increasing more rapidly.

Can you please explain why this wouldn't happen or how it will be prevented? It sounds like the language of the proposition undermines its own stated objectives, and it makes housing even more expensive for the next generation of renters. "	IAmA	IAmA	1

1274	"In my own experience, I find different benefits to doing cardio at different intensities.

To boil it down: do LISS to sustain LONG workout sessions, and do HIGHER INTENSITY cardio to power through TOUGH sets. 

Notice I didn't include HIIT, because you may not be getting sufficient resistance there to get your heart to producing great power for the tens of seconds of output you need for a tough set, if all you're doing is using a fixed bike.

Now, if you were actually out on a bike crushing hill after hill, I'd imagine that would very effective. Other good higher intensity cardio options could be: running hills/stairs, using an erg rower, or a Prowler, as /u/mythicalstrength suggested.

Of course, the other possibility is to drop weight and practice specifically what you want to do, at a lower resistance. To be honest, I bet throwing in a set or two of AMRAP at like 85% of the weight you want to do for ten would get you to your goal after a short while.

Also, adding 3 HIIT sessions on top of weights could be inducing a lot of general fatigue even if you aren't working your muscles with high resistance, so I'd say that's something else just to be mindful about. I think it's great to push yourself beyond lifting only though, so I applaud you and encourage your athletic pursuits!

Fwiw, I do LISS running twice a week and higher intensity erg rowing after two lifting sessions, for my own conditioning.

“There is a balm in Gilead, who cures the sin-sick soul.”"	"It’s not just “believing.”  Satan himself believes - he knows God, has conversations with God, lived in heaven with God before he fell. 

It’s trusting, loving, obeying God. Accepting as opposed to rejecting. Submitting. 

And yes if you reject your very Creator you deserve hell as do I, God have mercy. But my heart was mercifully changed and He sustains me.

1292	I’m going to post the end of my last reply. I’m a college coach and this is what we tell our players in the middle and end of the season. No one out there is 100 percent. Your goal is to be at your best. You don’t have to be feeling 100 percent to play your best of the year. It’s about being mentally tough. 	Yes but those of us that have know the defining aspect to playing with illness or injury is mentality. You don’t need to be feeling 100 percent to play your best. If that were the case, the best performances would be at the beginning of the year when everyone is fresh. 	leagueoflegends	leagueoflegends	1

1294	"Bittersweet to me is that the heroes triumph, but it’s an imperfect victory. What a lot of people forget is the sweet part of it. Case in point, the new Samurai Jack season (SPOILERS AHEAD)

In the end, Jack does defeat Aku, but by doing so he not only erases all the good he did in the future, he also unknowingly back to the future kills the woman he marries. This is far more bitter than sweet to us as an audience. What would be more ‘bittersweet’ is Jack choosing to remain in the future. It’s a personal sacrifice, but not one that makes the whole series pointless.

As far as how this relates to game of thrones, I’m worried that D&amp;D will also forget what bittersweet means. We want to watch the heroes succeed in what they set out to do, even if that means a personal sacrifice. Jon’s goal is to save the realm. If he does that, and then dies, that’s bittersweet. If he does it, but at the cost of more than half the major cast, that’s just depressing... We need to feel like the victory means something, and we can only do that if we get to watch characters we care about finally enjoying peace"	"I hear you, but that’s the thing. It isn’t supposed to be equal. Bittersweet is defined as (of food, drink, or flavor) sweet with a bitter aftertaste... it is primarily supposed to be sweet, but it’s not perfect. There is a mild, bitter aftertaste. I can understand Dany’s death being upsetting, because it isn’t in line with what her char hopes to achieve. It makes the rest of her arc somewhat moot, and turns her purpose into that of a plot device. Someone can still die, though, so long as it fits what you’ve come to expect from the character.

An example of this is Breaking Bad. Walt dies at the end, but it’s what you expected since season 1. You’re sad to see him go, but he succeeded in ensuring his children’s financial security and in the end he saves Jesse as well. That to me is the perfect example of what bittersweet should be. Something you see coming from a mile away, but in a way that fits the character and the story as a whole"	asoiaf	asoiaf	1

1297	"Absolutely pick up Lispector, she is a gem. I've had my eye on Hernandez as well, eventually I'll get around to Lands of Memory. Evelio Rosero is another New Directions author from Colombia (see Juan Gabriel Vásquez for another great Colombian author) who has been pretty solid so far. I've been torn with Aira, I didn't really care for Ghosts but An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter was good. I liked Senselessness by Castellanos Moya as well, though I've read better 'oppressive regime' novels from the region, such as The Feast of the Goat by Mario Vargas Llosa, which is excellent.

Katarina Dodson (who translated the Lispector short stories) is doing a new translation of Macunaíma by Mário de Andrade which I'm looking forward to, and I'm hoping somebody finally bankrolls Alison Entreki's English translation of Grande Sertão: Veredas by João Guimarães Rosa which is apparently THE Brazilian classic to read."	This probably isn't the case 9 times out of 10 for people, but if you ever plan on selling the books, the dust cover makes a difference on what you'll get for a book.

"	"I suggest you do at *least* 20 or 30 proper portrait shoots before you start thinking about charging people money. You need to be confident that you can deliver consistent quality, with a variety of subjects and a variety of circumstances. 

These days, everybody who buys a DSLR and takes a few ok portraits thinks they're owed money. They know they can find a decent background, set a wide aperture, and take a picture that looks better than a smartphone. I think being a portrait photographer who's worth money should be a lot more than that. You don't have to be a world class photographer to take some senior portraits for cash, but there are things about poses, expressions, angles, perspective, lighting, and postproduction that simply take more than a handful of shoots to learn to do well - not to mention the social interactions and all the curveballs that a shooting situation can throw at you.

1302	Again I need to state that I am talking from a Danish perspective, not a Bulgarian or Italian one.

"Oh, please don't misunderstand. I absolutely don't believe opposition is equal to disinterest. I would much rather my party of choice was simply not interested in a favorable (in my opinion) policy, rather than it being against it.

But I also don't believe it should serve as a redeeming quality that any particular party does not consider failing infrastructure worth the political labor. Where a party focuses its lens says as much about its priorities as its members' individual voting records, I believe. 

In shorter terms, I agree that a party does not deserve the same degree of condemnation for simply not focusing on an issue; but I think it is absolutely abhorrent that a party supposedly working for the middle class does not consider infrastructure reform a worthwhile political investment.

Anyways, I switched to my current dentist a few years later and she set me up with a BEAUTIFUL full porcelain crown that matched perfectly. Nobody can tell it isn't my real tooth.

1327	Name one Moto gp rider who doesn't use rear brakes. They use it so much many have a push button set up for their thumb on the bars. They also have adjustable engine braking as well to use as a rear brake.	Just be careful. A vrod is not a cornering machine. Even the tires available to you aren't for cornering aggressively. If you are pushing it on the old bike as hard as you say eventually you will do the same to this bike. If I were you I'd get a sport standard or sport bike. It sounds like you enjoy cornering and dragging knee and you are handicapping yourself by pushing a cruiser hard. It's also pretty unsafe. If you are committed to keeping the vrod I would make sure you have the best tires possible. I would also make sure to know EXACTLY when it scrapes. Even sport bikes sometimes need shorter or higher up rear sets when the rider starts pushing it. Scraping takes weight off the tires and can cause a crash. Up the rear preload and like I said be careful. This bike is long and heavy, nearly as long as a smart car. So don't push or rush it. You have all the time in the world to get good at cornering that thing. Have fun and stay safe	motorcycles	motorcycles	1

One thing I think would help is tightlining your eyes. Right now, you can see the skin of your upper eyelid/lashline peeking through your eyelashes underneath your eyeliner. If you took a black pencil eyeliner and ran it through your eyelashes or in your upper waterline, it would help your liquid liner blend in better and your lashes look fuller.
It also looks to me like your eyeshadow is extending up to your brow bone. This is personal preference (as is everything :)), but for an everyday look I would try to keep the color concentrated just above the place where your eyelid folds, maybe going about halfway up the space between the fold and your brow.
Your eye color is stunning, and the pinky shadows you chose are perfect complimentary colors to help emphasize it. Great choice!

There's no where else but up though, right?

I have for the past nine months been shopping at a local farmers co-op buying only organic, non GMO produce. I blend it up in a nutribullet and drink twice a day. My health is best it's been in years. I go to the gym 4 times a week. I'm doing everything I can and I'm seeking knowledge everyday. 

Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Josh Axe, Eric Berg, Thomas DeLauer, ihealthtube.com, nutritionfacts.org, (all YouTube channels) are people I listen to for good information that can help you understand natural health benefits of food especially anti inflammatory food. 

I'd be happy to share all the information I have. Whether that be what I eat, how I work out, the ingredients for my Nutribullets and why I choose them. I don't care. If you want to talk about it let's talk about it and hopefully you're reading this and have been wanting to make a change and now I think is the time to do it. I don't want you to take my word on anything. At the end go check out the research that has been done and see the life transforming power of food as medicine.

Dump statement. Stupid ad hominem. None of us are Valve employees, so at best we are ALL speculating. Unless you are a valve developer, don't make statements like this. From here on out we will understand that we are all speculating unless facts are presented. Thank you. Also I know as much about WC3 Dota as the next person. Thank you very much.


&gt; Shallow grave is triggered heal....

Quote from the skill's description. ""The target is kept alive by having its minimum health set to 1."" This is not healing. It literally is stopping you from going below 1 by setting 1 as your minimum and stopping you from takign damage beyond that. More accurately you could have just said ""discussion is about wc3 dota"" (see last section). To which I would say ""oh yea, triggered heals were a thing then""

&gt; Second, you ignore the fact you CAN'T use HP Removal for lethal instance of damage, it just makes units suicide.

False, you can kill with hp removal UNLESS prevented by interaction. Experiment for you: go get life drained by Pugna.

&gt; Do you really believe that would be intended that whenever you cull/reap/shatter someone, you get NO kill credit?

False again. I clearly stated that Hp manipulation is counted. Experiment for you: Again life drain since it is the simplest hp manipulator in the game with minimal interactions. You play Pugna and life drain peeps. Experiment 2: Go sunder people with TB.

&gt; Third, you make for a bad game dev, no offense. You fail to account for things like Dispersion or Bristleback, as they reduce all damage types, so your version of Culling Blade wouldn't instakill at the same health threshold as any other unit.

First statement, stupid ad hominem again. Secondly, I DID consider those spells and my statements were made based on culling blade the spell. It can be speculated that culling blade is meant as a killing tool. It is not balanced around the damage in the non-kill instance. It is balanced around its threshold in the kill instance. As such, it makes MOST sense for the devs to make it Pure damage, hp removal for easy coding. Dispersion DOES NOT reduce culling blade in the kill scenario. Bristleback DOES NOT reduce culling blade in the kill scenario. Why? Pure damage hp removal. Reduction is only considered for the non-kill scenario which does a fixed amount of damage.

&gt; Also, since it's physical damage, ...

The spell's description clearly states it's pure damage. Not sure why you are still hung up on physical. Unless you want to go tell Valve they are wrong. 

&gt; it also purges you in order to get rid of potential ethereal

This makes no sense. The ability to purge has nothing to do with damage. That's just a property of the spell that was added in 6.72d. As counter points, diffusal blades active is a purge that does no damage. Razor's unstable current is a purge that does magical damage. Physical damage, no damage or magical damage. None of this have anything to do with the ability to purge.


&gt; And last, where the fuck did you get this from?

Description of the spell. Unless again you want to go tell valve they are wrong.

&gt; it wouldn't disable Blink Dagger, for instance, otherwise, and such a damage type just doesn't exist in WC3 DotA.

This makes no sense. HP removal is a damage. Just not one of the normal 3. As a damage it will block blink dagger. The only documented caveat is that hp removal will not interact with consumables. Eg. cancelling salve. Also wrong, Hp removal WAS present in WC3 Dota. It just couldn't kill. I remember that cause no end to bugs involving Lanaya's refraction. They ""fixed"" it in Dota 2 by allowing hp removal to kill.

&gt; Terroblade might get credit in Dota 2, but even if he does, he can't kill with it directly, so that's not relevant at all,

It is relevant because you said in the previous post ""In order to give credit for damage and kills, you have to deal real damage instead of manipulating health."". I said nothing about TB killing with Sunder. I said he gets damage credit. Making this statement false.

&gt; especially in the game in question, WC3 DotA. Stay on topic, will ya?

Literally the only thing of relevance. I admitted to not seeing the (1) in brackets when I responded. The OP civilly pointed this out and I civilly accepted. You on the other hand jumped in and spat nonsense everywhere instead of a simple ""oh that was an interaction in WC3 Dota"" to which I would have said ""Oh yea I missed the (1) in the OP's initial statement as that would make valid some of the things discussed"". Next time you figure out what to say before saying it."	DotA2	DotA2	1

People are playing decks that are a reasonable down payment on a car. An extra $200-300 to get all of your sweet, sweet cards signed by the actual artist is great.
"	"What's happening is that people don't like paying the higher prices, even if the higher prices are roughly about what you'd expect to pay with a reasonable tip.  They just think they are getting charged more, even when most of the time they are getting charged the same or even less. 


Granted, there are some miserable people who don't tip well at all.  I refuse to go out with a group of people at my LGS after seeing them each tip $1-2 on tabs that were $20 each.  I actually ended up doubling my tip to make up for that bs (And I already tip well above average). 


The problem is that tipping allows menu prices to be cheap, even if the entire tab is the same or even lower.  This has a bit of psychological impact on people, as Americans have a pretty ingrained sense of bargain shopping.  A big part of American culture is penny pinching to a degree, and tipping plays off of that in a roundabout way.  People don't enjoy tipping, so much as tipping allows for the appearance of lower prices."	magicTCG	magicTCG	1
1345	Hey, I'll be honest - sometimes people have to worry about their own problems rather than impose them on their partner. Being naked around others happens all the time in non-sexual contexts (for example, the gym).

1346	"Try switching your aside questions around from the other point of view.

1. Is it okay for a girl to say no to sex with her boyfriend if she is not feeling it? Of course!
2. Is it okay for a girl not to cum during sex even though they find their boyfriend attractive?  It happen all the time! In fact it is usually considered 'good form' for the guy to make some special effort to help the girlfriend to cum if she is able.

It sounds like your girlfriend (and you) have some expectations about what is supposed to happen during sex, i.e. that they fuck and the guy cums, and in that moment it is the proof of all those things that validate each other, i.e. you love her, find her attractive, etc.  ""Movie sex"", basically.

There are so many reasons why it doesn't happen that way.  One thing that's common is when people get stuck in their own heads and that prevents them from cumming.  They are anxious and thinking about something else: I've got a hair in my mouth, my belly looks gross, I have a headache, did I send that email to the wrong person... stuff like that going on in your head is stopping thousands of men and women from cumming right this second, all over the world.

It can be a real headfuck though.  *Why didn't he cum, doesn't he find me attractive? Why didn't I cum, is there something wrong with me?*  There is so much pressure to perform, and then if it doesn't happen the chasm seems like it opens up below.

I have had to tap-out myself from having sex because I couldn't cum, for whatever reason.  I have also refused sex from my drunk girlfriend returning in the middle of the night - again, play that situation with the genders reversed and see how it tastes.  I think in that situation there is a lot of pressure to perform, and then to say ""You have to cum"" really piles it on.  Even someone without your history could find it hard to cum in those circumstances.  I would find it difficult, even if on another day I could be up for it.

Her being drunk probably turned this situation into an emotional firebomb, which is unfortunate.  It isn't fair on you to take all of that on board.  I know it's only alcohol but another way of looking at it is, she was high on drugs and then had a freak-out.  I would hope that she would apologise to you for putting you in that situation once she is sober, but perhaps  she needs to hear again how things are difficult for you before she can realise it isn't anything to do with her body-image etc."	"Lube, and lots of it, even with the handjob.

I think the first part of your criticism is subjective. Some people do enjoy watching gameplay videos than playing the game themselves. Which is totally cool. I'm really interested in why you found Shadow of the Colossus hard to get through.

When you say that you found the controls atrocious, do you mean the key bindings weren't ideal or is it more about the overall way you control the character or agro?

Personally I felt that bow aiming was a bit wonky. Mainly because it uses just one button for drawing and releasing and the way you moved the bow crosshair was tough to control with just one analog stick.

You talk about seeing someone who looks like he's undeserving getting payouts, and you conclude that it's right we should have a clampdown on them. Fair enough. But the thing is, the DWP isn't really clamping down on them at all.

You see, the DWP doesn't really care that much about fraud. Fraud rates are below 1%, and professional fraudsters make it their business to keep track of what's going on and stay ahead of the game. With the DWP under so much pressure to cut costs, clamping down on fraud would be a waste of effort. They need low-hanging fruit.

The low hanging fruit are the unwary. The honest, hardworking folk who have paid into the National Insurance fund all their life, and have now fallen on hard times. They walk into their Work Capability Assessment believing that if they just explain to the nice lady how their health stops them from working, they'll be fine.

A few weeks later they get a medical report that looks like it was written about an entirely different person. They fall straight through a hole in the social safety net and land hard.

And, like you, their first response is often to blame the fraudsters. ""It's because of people like them that I'm being treated so harshly."" But, in my view, the real fraudster here is the government who have have been snipping away at the social safety net and hoping nobody will notice.

Oh, by the way, if you check official DWP figures, fraud rates have risen and are now somewhere above 1%.

For men there are pills to jumpstart this process and recover normal functions quickly but I don’t know of a female version and have looked. You could stop anytime and be no worse off than you currently are but as the test is treating the deficit, stopping brings back the symptoms until you recover.

1366	maximalism isnt inherently better than minimalism. I'd rather have a simple story done well than a complex and highly developed story that I dislike. Whether it's personal preference or not, that's what my opinion boils down to here. 	"Once you're in a high GR, you just herd packs together and burst them down. How you do that is up to you, but yeah, that's the whole thing right there.   
  
Early game, you find unique items and build a character around what you find and fight enemies as you advance through dungeons. Everything's about the anticipation of what item you'll find next and how it will potentially change your whole strategy.    
  
Mid-game, your build is mostly done, there are no real gear surprises coming. You speedily run, jump, or teleport from elite pack to elite pack &amp; annihilate them on a difficulty that is quick &amp; efficient to farm. You gather tons of items by the bucketload just to salvage them all at once without looking at them and work on rerolling/reforging your existing items until you have all the right stats.      
  
Late game, your build was done long ago and you're just getting tiny tiny upgrades and paragon levels and gem levels. You slog carefully through high GRs, dodge every enemy attack, and use AoE to burst down your carefully shepherded packs. If you're not focused on getting somewhere on the leaderboards you should probably find some other goal for yourself.   
  
It's pretty fun and if you have the mindset for it you can easily get high 3-digit or even 4-digit hours out of this game.

&amp;#x200B;

Not really, especially if you genuinely enjoy it and put a lot of hours into it. You don't need to buy any of the DLC (unless you wanna play the character) to enjoy the game, it isn't like 90% of players will be at a disadvantage because they don't own noctis.

&amp;#x200B;

 I love it and have hundreds of hours into it and the only DLC i purchased was geese. I also think I got the base game for $44-ish on PC at release (think it was $50 for PC and $60 for consoles). If you put a few hundred hours into it, you've gotten more than your monies worth.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; With how they're milking DLC characters in T7 

&amp;#x200B;

I can kiiiinddaaa sorrrrttaaa agree with this, even though I don't think it's bad, ESPECIALLY compared to other fighting games like SFV and MVCI (rest in pepperonis).

No, it is pretty clear cut lol. A noob can get in and learn the basics, shit, even get ""okay"" at the game MUCH easier in SC6 than he would in tekken 7. That is not saying SC is an ""easy"" game or anything of the sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Sure, there are a few characters in T7 that are really damn noob friendly (don't have super long high execution combos, their B&amp;Bs are pretty easy, don't require you to do shit like 3 electrics in a row lol),  that as a brand new player you can get into the game with and get pretty decent at the game with. But that doesn't change the fact in tekken you gotta learn and master fundamentals and whatnot.

&amp;#x200B;

meanwhile in SC6 you don't have long 69 hit wall carry combos that require you to hit 3 very quick near frame perfect moves and no KBD(afaik). I'm not saying SC6 is easy in the slightest, im just saying as a brand new player you can get into it easier and be able to get some good matches in faster than you could(for most people) with taken.

"A structure is supposed to be flexible, especially in seismic areas or under other dynamic loads. But you need to limit that flexibility, otherwise it becomes unusable.

For example, you can't have nonstructural elements like glass or plaster become damaged every time a mild shock affects the building. And you can't have bent beams or visibly fissured concrete, as no one will feel safe in the building, even if it is perfectly sound.

Going strictly by Colbert's definition, an onion soup served in a bread bowl could qualify as a sandwich.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are talking about specific funding that the Federal government gives to public schools - that gets given to the States to distribute but it is still classified as Federal funding. We are talking about State funding....

&amp;#x200B;

The states make a budget and they decide how much to assign to hospitals, schools, roads, whatever. It is the States responsibility to manage public schools. They make their own budget and spend accordingly. It is not a fixed budget given to them by the Commonwealth."	"This needs to be made clear as there is so much misinformation out there.

&amp;#x200B;

The STATES primarily fund public schools. More than 80% of their funding as it stands comes from the States and they have control and responsibility over public schools. This is a fact and is written in legislation.

&amp;#x200B;

It used to be that States funded their public schools fully, but they did such a poor job the Commonwealth (Federal) had to intervene. This is why they provide a small amount to public schools, however as stated above, public schools are primarily funded and are the full responsibility of the STATES.

&amp;#x200B;

If your local public school is suffering, this is not an issue with Federal funding, it is an issue with your State Government.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful taking sides with certain parties with thoughts such as ""Damn Liberals screwing my public schools again"" as you will find that currently in Victoria it is held by Labor, and they are responsible right now for the poor public schools in that state. Western Australia is held by Labor. Queensland is held by Labor. ACT is held by Labor.

&amp;#x200B;

Labor also introduced Gonski 1.0 which gave record levels of funding to Private schools, particularly the wealthy ones, and the Liberal's Gonski 2.0, for all its criticism, actually reduced it.

D2 had NPCs that were much more integrated in the world around them. We know Akara is a High Priestess of the Sisterhood of the Sightless, and she was kicked out of the Rogue Monastery. She's got a tenuous relationship with Kashya, who's also part of the group. Every single character has something unique, whether it's Meshif collecting statues, or Natalya who's keeping an eye on Ormus in case he gets corrupted. Many of these people also have connections for specific classes and will comment on it only if greeted with the particular class.

D3 has some relevant sidekicks that follow you around from town to town, but there's nothing that ties them to the greater world of Sanctuary. The closest we get is finding out that Myriam (guess who that is) is part of the Vecin. And yes, there are some tiny hidden NPC interactions like you mentioned, but I have zero emotional attachment to them since I never interact with them. They're just there to fill in the background, but there's nothing interesting about random boring people that are dying."	Great question that I don't know the answer to.

1400	Ever since 2008 I have been watching on average 150-200 movies per year. The only condition is to never have watched it before. They have to be new. Old movies you already saw is like cheating. Some time during the early 2010's I discovered a lot of tv shows and it slowed me down a lot and some years I only saw 120 films tops. But lately I have picked it up. 2010 was my best year with 360 films watched down to 10 minutes before new years day at midnight. Strangely the film I saw that time was District B13 Ultimatum. LOL. It is actually difficult to watch so many movies because it gives you genre fatigue. There was a point in which watching so many dramas simply depressed the shit out of me and I stopped watching the genre for the rest of the year. Watching Horror and SciFi is fun and easy for me so I use those genres as bulk to sort of help me digest more serious movies. I have kept track of all these films and even write the dates I watched them on and the rating I gave it on imdb. There are still some classic films I have yet to watch because I get lazy. Watching so many movies for the sake of watching movies gets boring at times. At first this was all to help me become a better screen writer but to be honest it doesn't help. But I do notice cinematography a lot more now and how scenes are broken down, etc etc. Identify good and bad acting etc etc. That said I notice Comedy is my least favorite genre. A lot of really shitty comedies lately. Oh yeah and films used to be better. Better written, better acted. More care was put into them. Today films are lazy and generic. Not all but in general. 	Try to mix it up with genres you like. Otherwise it gets pretty boring after a while and it will hurt your love of film. Trust me. 	movies	movies	1

1414	"ALL ""live view"" from ALL cameras is delayed view, it is just a matter of degree.  It is basic physics: it takes time to read out a sensor, process it into an image and send it to the LCD.  An optical viewfinder works at the speed of light, so effectively no delay.

This becomes important if you are tracking fast action.

Second, if you are doing low light long exposure photography, any use of live view heats the camera and the sensor.  A long exposure itself effectively does not heat the sensor, but the readout at the end does, and it takes minutes to recover to a lower temperature.  The resulting problem: noise from increased dark current.  So if you are doing night photos with seconds to tens of seconds and longer exposures, avoid use of live view.  Dark current doubles for every 5 to 6 degrees C increase in temperature."	"&gt; Why would the total amount of light collected matter?

Because the noise we see in our digital camera images is mostly from the light signal itself--the noise is the square root of the amount of light collected.

The light comes from the lens.  The sensor is just a ""bucket.""

He went to her room to convince her to run away with him and that he would protect her, but by the time she showed up, he was traumatized AND shitfaced, so it went... badly. 

He SAYS he should have raped her bloody to Arya while he's laying dying on the Trident, while trying to convince her to stick Needle through his heart. When just half a page earlier, he was sobbing because he couldn't stop her from being beaten. Does that sound like a man who intended to rape her? Really? Or does it sound like a guy who  is trying desperately to antagonize Arya into mercy killing him?

Sandor is a hypocrite. He says horrible things, he kills people, but wants desperately to be loved. He is a better knight than actual knights and will not buy into their bullshit. Everyone is so collectively pissed at Sandor for killing Mycah, but think about why. It's because we see him coming back from that from Ned's POV, then we hear about it about a billion bloody times in Arya's POV chapters. It's easy to empathize with Ned and Arya because we love them, and see people like Sandor through their filters, and view him as they do.

1429	"~~Avocados are unusual amongst fruit because they only begin to ripen once they have been picked~~ .^((see below)) As to what happens during ripening, [this review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.2740291007) says:

&gt;The oil level in the flesh generally increases (\~10%) during ripening, but the increase varies between fruits and occasionally small decreases have been observed. The oil is the major energy store of the fruit and is involved in ripening but it does not appear to fuel the respiration. The quantity of oil probably remains unchanged with the apparent increase due to the weight loss by respiration.  
&gt;  
&gt;Respiration seems to be fuelled largely by degradation of the sugars and possibly hemicelluloses and pectic  substances. Keto sugars fructose and mannoheptulose were the sugars mostly consumed in ripening. The fall in total sugars during ripening varied from 50 to 85 %.

What that means is that the carbohydrates are being broken down and respired, so the oil percentage of the fruit increases, but the total weight decreases.

This seems like an appropriate place to mention that avocados evolved to be eaten by [giant ground sloths](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-the-avocado-should-have-gone-the-way-of-the-dodo-4976527/) which is why the seeds are so large. It's a very clever strategy for trees as the seed lets a seedling [wait it out in the shade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_tolerance) until another tree dies and creates a gap.

​"	Hmm well I've heard this in plenty of places before (can't seem to find any links though...), and unfortunately I can't grow avocados at home :( I'll strike it out. It may be that this is the standard way that they are picked commercially (similar to tomatoes) and once picked they  begin to ripen, but if left they will eventually ripen.	askscience	askscience	1

I think it's going to take longer than that - we've been working towards equality for quite a long time now, and while there's been so much change compared to 200 or even 50 years ago, there's still quite a ways to go.

"The title and the article are VERY misleading. The court added a long list of caveats, like the fact that the accused didn't argue factually, didn't present evidence or the historical context and even (according to the verdict) used false factual statements that as a self-proclaimed expert on the subject she couldn't have ignored. Is on this and other limits that the verdict was reached.

I'm still kinda upset about it, because religious feelings should never be protected, but it's way less arbitrary and atrocious as the article here is describing it.

Read the thing for yourselves, it's way different from how it was presented.

1437	"I think the main thing was just that the CBJ coaching staff was trying all year to get Johnson and Savard going as the shutdown pairing, and it never paid off. After trading for Cole, he and Savard became the shutdown pair, and they were decent at it. All 3 players were around 55% d zone starts, Ryan Murray rounded out that group around 52%.

With how anemic our forward group was last year, it felt like Jones and Werenski were always going out for O Zone faceoffs just because they were the only D pairing that was any good at creating offense, and the gap to the second best pairing was huge as far as offense goes. 

I think if Jones and Werenski didn't have such great chemistry, that Jones would end up with a more 50/50 split on the zone starts. I also think that if either Gostisbehere or Provorov were right handed and played well together, it would be a very very similar situation to Jones and Werenski. Provorov and Gostisbehere would probably have way better stats though just because of the firepower up front in Philly."	"Columbus - He's not really unknown, but Pierre Luc-Dubois is poised to significantly increase his ice time and production.

He only really spent the last quarter of last season as the full time 1st line center, had no PP time with the top unit, and was missing Cam Atkinson for about 8 weeks. If he spends the whole year flanked by Atkinson and Panarin, and gets more PP time, he could hit 70 points.

Less well known is Vitaly Abramov. He's coming directly from the Q like Dubois did last year, and had very similar production to PLD while he was there.

I really loved Kanger tanks and Joyetech mods back then. I still use the VTC, now upgraded with Arctic Fox, for my non-nicotine vaping needs. I'm all about single coil RTAs these days.

It's the same as: your grandpa committed a murder and *you* as his grandson must serve time in prison for that crime. GLAD we got rid of this immoral crap."	"&gt; It doesn't matter if they were profoundly Christian when their reasons and motivations were secular.

Yes it does matter. It shows that profound Christianity doesn't stop people to fight horrific wars. During WWI the Germans had the parole ""Gott mit uns"" (""God with us"") in their heraldry and written on the coupling-straps of the soldier's uniforms. And each county had its variant: the English ""God with us"", the French ""Dieu et mon droit"", the Russians *Съ нами Богъ!* - ""S nami Bog!"" (""With us god!""). During wars at the beginning of each raid short prayers were done. ""God with us"" was yelled over centuries in all regional languages all over the continent when a battle took off.

It shows that religion motivates warfare and that it makes no difference whether a nation is religious or less religious.

&gt; Most violence and atrocities that occurred in the Age of Enlightenment onward were non-religious, anti-religious and atheistic, and indisputably much more heinous than the religious atrocities in the Middle Ages.

This IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I provided you a link to a list of wars fought in Europe since the Middle Ages. REALLY read through that list and notice how your contentions are falsified.

I wrote that most conflicts are about nationalism and tribalism. So were WWI and WWII. Nationalism and tribalism as such have *nothing* to do with atheism or secularism.

Thirdly, why conflicts take ever greater death tolls in modern times is due to advancing warfare technology and internationalization. In the ME there simply was no technology to slaughter 100,000 people in a few days. There even were no logistical means to fight wars over a whole continent. Also the population numbers were low. In 1200 Europe counted ~100 million inhabitants, that's about the population of Germany and the Netherlands combined today. Even throwing an atom bomb would have taken a death toll far less than it would today.

But advanced warfare technology and smaller populations have *nothing* to do with any *motive* for those conflicts. Moreover, cruelty is not only measured in numbers of casualties. It is also established by the *ways* atrocities are committed. So you think that the ME were less cruel? You really should read [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sword-Fire-Atrocity-Medieval-Paperbacks/dp/0304366951) by historian Sean McGlinn (*By Sword and Fire: Cruelty And Atrocity In Medieval Warfare: The Savage Reality of Medieval Warfare*). For your convenience here's the Amazon abstract:

&gt; Sean McGlynn investigates the reality of medieval warfare. For all the talk of chivalry, medieval warfare routinely involved acts which we would consider war crimes. Lands laid waste, civilians slaughtered, prisoners massacred: this was standard fare justified by tradition and practical military necessity. It was unbelievably barbaric, but seldom uncontrolled. Such acts of atrocity were calculated, hideous cruelties inflicted in order to achieve a specific end. Sean McGlynn examines the battles of Acre and Agincourt, sieges like Béziers, Lincoln, Jerusalem and Limoges as well as the infamous chevauchées of the Hundred Years War that devastated great swathes of France. He reveals how these grisly affairs form the origin of accepted 'rules of war', codes of conduct that are today being enforced in the International Court of Justice in the Hague.

A little example by me: the siege of Béziers. As you know, the crusades were religious wars. Not many people know that crusades were not only ordered by the pope to fight Islam in the Holy Land. They also were issued against religious minorities within Europe itself. For instance, the Albigensian Crusade was ordered in the early 13th century by pope Innocent III (what's in a name...) to eliminate Catharism in the Languedoc, In 1209 the city of Béziers was besieged because it was known to be a stronghold of Catharism. When the city's defences collapsed, Arnaud Amalric, Abbot of Citeaux, who commanded the crusade army, asked what to do with its inhabitants that still were Catholic. The pope answered: ""Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius"", which means: ""Kill them all because the Lord knows those who are His own."" Consequently the whole city was sacked, all inhabitants were killed, irrespective age, sex or religious affinity. Arnaud was so kind to write it down neatly in a letter to the pope in august 1209:

&gt;  While discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders. To our amazement, crying ""to arms, to arms!"", within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and Béziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and burnt.

Gee, it reads as one of the massacres of the OT.

&gt; The genocides in communist Europe was atheistic.

You REALLY mustn't distort history all the time. Here is a short summary of what actually happened, let's take the rule of Stalin, the most notorious of Soviet regimes (there's not much agreement about the exact number, so I merely take the uppermost estimates):

1. the very most victims of Stalin were the 1932-33 famines due to idiotic reorganization, collectivisation and mismanagement of the agricultural sector as well as reinforced resettlements of the kulaks (farmers) - 6-7 million deaths. Also natural causes count, especially draught and plant diseases. The 1930-33 famine was preceded by many other, similar famines during the whole history of Russia and weren't confined to the Communist era. But at least part of these deaths was an unintended effect of Communist policy (but yet, evidently, communism can be held responsible for that). 

2. direct killing of people: 6-9 million people (most historians estimate it to be less though, after the collapse of the Soviet union, when official Russian records became available, the numbers are revised downwards, most likely according to current estimates some 3-5 million people). Most of those killed were political opponents of the Bolsheviks. The ones killed for their religious affinity were many but still a minority.

So the vast majority of massacres by Communism had nothing to do with their atheism. So I could argue like you and say ""doesn't matter if they were profoundly atheist"" but I won't make that mistake myself. Also here the correct conclusion would be: apparently atheism doesn't stop people to kill. Like religion doesn't stop people to kill. It's relevant to observe how profound Christian nations fought hundreds of wars during the post-Roman history of Europe.

&gt; The Holocaust was pseudoscientific

The Holocaust was WHAT?

Above all, the Holocaust was a disaster rooted in anti-Semitism that haunted Europe as long as Christianity ruled the continent. It is deeply rooted in Christianity. It was implemented by a profound Christian nation and instigated by the Nazis, which all were raised Christians. Hitler himself referred to ""the Almighty"" in many of his infamous speeches as well as his ""Mein Kampf"", well up to the last years of WWII, *especially* when he referred to the ""Jewish problem"". Anti-Semitism was vibrant during the last decades of the 19th century well up to the 1940s and German Nazism only was merely a continuation and culmination of it. Look up ""Dreyfuss affair"".

Hitler was very fond of Luther - yes *that* guy, the founder of Protestantism - and called him the greatest German of all times. And he liked him because of Luther's virulent and maddened anti-Semitism. Luther wrote several works on the Jewish problem: *Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen* (""On the Jews and Their Lies"") and *Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi* (""Of the Unknowable Name and the Generation of Christ""), the most important ones. The former already scored 5 reprints during Luther's life. It apparently was a very popular work in those days. Let's have a quote from that book:

&gt; First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools … This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians.

&gt; Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed.

&gt; Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them.

&gt; Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb.

&gt; Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside.

&gt; Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them.

&gt; Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow … But if we are afraid that they might harm us or our wives, children, servants, cattle, etc., … then let us emulate the common sense of other nations such as France, Spain, Bohemia, etc., … then eject them forever from the country.

It almost reads as written by the Nazis themselves during the Wannsee conference.

Moreover, many Nazis, especially the highly ranked, tended to disengaged themselves from Christianity but as an alternative engulfed themselves in occultism of all sorts. Also not quite an atheist thing.

Historian Daniel Goldhagen wrote 2 important books: *Hitler’s Willing Executioners*, about the greediness of the German people in participating in Hitler's policies and *A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair*. So at least we may conclude that the role the Catholic and Protestant churches played during the Holocaust was dubious at least."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

1458	"I've been going through a process of really questioning my faith over the past year or so.   I've read the Bible a lot, researched a lot of places on the internet, looked at debates here, and talked with several pastors.   I have multiple concerns about the Bible that I haven't had a clear answer to yet.  I'd like to share one.

In Matthew 2:15, the author claims that Jesus returning from Egypt fulfils a prophecy from Hosea.  A lot of people recognize that the Hosea verse is clearly about Israel.   Christians say it is a dual prophecy, or also highlights the future Christ.  

I think that a clear reading of the context of the Hosea verses not only clearly indicate it is about Israel, but would actually make it impossible to be a prophecy about Jesus.  

Hosea 11:1.  When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.

Clearly Israel is the son.  But let's allow dual prophecy.  And then continue on with the context. 

Hosea 11:2. But the more they were called, the more they went away from me.  They sacrificed to the baals, and burned incense to images.

This is clearly a continuation of the son from verse 1.    So if the son in verse 1 is Jesus, did Jesus also turn away from God, sacrifice to baals, and burn incense to images?  

If Hosea 11 is about Jesus, then Jesus is a disobedient child, and not sinless.  Unless we have a reason to only take Hosea 11:1 and not think Hosea 11:2 continues the thought.  

If it is not, then it seems like Matthew cherry picked words out of the old testament to make it seem like Jesus was fulfilling a prophecy.  "	"Since we do not have a way to test your idea currently, it should be classified as a hypothesis, not a fact or law.

1467	"Edit:  I'm adding our text exchange below.  I'm also clarifying he claims to have reached a point where he no longer sins and claims NOT to have sinned in a very very long time.:

ME:  How does this verse apply to a believer?  “If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” ‭‭1 John‬ ‭1:8‬ ‭KJV‬‬

HIM:  This is about people coming to Christ. If this was true the rest of 1 John would be false and we know the Bible does not contradict itself. I warned you of these false prophets.

ME:  Then does the New Testament, teach sinless perfection?

HIM:  No, Sinless perfection teaches that it is not possible to sin. The Bible doesn’t teach that. You can go back to sin and backslide at anytime. But the Bible does command you to walk free of sin. It is your choice to be holy. By God’s Grace we abide in Christ. 

ME:  I would never presume to be completely free from sin.  Sin can hide stealthily in the deepest corners of our lives.  To claim I am sinless would be sin in itself.  The sin of pride.

HIM:  This is where you need to understand the Bible. If you are in sin you are going to hell. You are deceived. How much more scripture do you need to see. You are not understanding. Sinners are destroyed by God. That’s why we need Christ. To come out of our sin and live holy. You need Christ

HIM:  And having been set free from sin, you became slaves of righteousness.
Romans 6:18

HIM:  Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans 6:11 
Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?
Romans 6:2

HIM:  And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!
1 Corinthians 15:17 

HIM:  We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God keeps  himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.
1 John 5:18 

HIM:  Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1 Thessalonians 5:23 

HIM:  Let me know if you need some more. It’s the main theme of the Bible so let me know if you need more. Staying in sin is pride, not walking holy

*Michael Daniel was worried. He believed the Russians’ ability to fiddle with the national vote count—and swing a national US election to a desired candidate—seemed limited, if not impossible. “We have 3,000 jurisdictions,” Daniel subsequently explained. “You have to pick the county where the race was going to be tight and manipulate the results. That seemed beyond their reach. The Russians were not trying to flip votes. To have that level of precision was not feasible.”*

*Daniel was focused on another parade of horribles: If hackers could penetrate a state election voter database, they might be able to delete every 10th name. Or flip two digits in a voter’s ID number—so when a voter showed up at the polls, his or her name would not match. The changes could be subtle, not easily discerned. But the potential for disorder on Election Day was immense.

The median salary for a mechanic is $38,470.

The median mechanical engineering salary is $84,190. With the entry level at around 50-60k. I mean think about that. The average 22 year old with 50k debt is making 12-22k more per year than the average mechanic who's worked for 20 years already.

What? Engineers in India make way less because the standard / cost of living there is so less. India is one of the poorest countries in the world, obviously their salaries for everything will be lower. Like the average salary for a meche is 337,000 rupies a year. 

https://www.payscale.com/research/IN/Job=Mechanical_Engineer/Salary

That's 5,000 USD man lmao. It's not comparable to the US *at all*. 

Also, it seems that US isn't even the highest in terms of salaries for engineers. 

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/12/the-best-and-worst-countries-for-paying-engineering-grads.html

Switzerland has the highest entry level engineering salary compared to the US (#2), Denmark is #3. 

And like in Germany for example, the average entry level salary is 42-44k euros. If you convert that to USD it's also 50,000 a year lol. 

I'm not saying that the salaries will never downturn, but I think of it similar to lawyers and doctors. Engineers are just always needed in modern society, and the difficulty in becoming one will at least keep the numbers from going crazy. Even like lawyers who it seems aren't having the salary numbers as before still all do well enough. 

&gt;Why not push for people to be awesome critically thinking mechanics rather than engineers, they would have their own upward mobility within their passion.

In ESB we had the big evil empire and their huge warships and omnipresence in big cities like Mos Eisley. Tatooine and Yavin had specific and memorable architectures we spent solid time in.

Comparatively, there are a lot of people on Takodana in the bar, but it's essentially a big empty jungle with a castle on it. The base at D'Qar is fairly generic and we barely meet anyone before sprinting out the door back to Starkiller base - which is essentially a bunch of empty corridors we also get little to nothing background from.

Compare that to the Death Star, where we've got fairly significant dialogue and political machinations going on with voiced admirals arguing with Vader and his ilk.

Really TFA is the Mass Effect 2 of the trilogy, because like Mass Effect 2 it establishes little and progresses almost nothing toward the resolution of the plot."	movies	movies	1

I don't know. I've been fortunate to have a lot of happy moments in my life. In some cases I'm free to pursue more of them. Others are more rare and others were most likely once in a lifetime.

I'm not sure how to compare them really. Sure getting a job I really wanted was better than finding a snickers the fridge I'd forgotten about. But holding my niece for the first time, finishing my favorite book, realizing that my best friends have been around for 12 years now and they'll probably stay that way until a funeral gets in the way? Not only do I not know where to start ranking them I think it diminishes them to try.

Happiness, like the rest of the universe, is complex. Possibly complex beyond hope of human comprehension. In the face of that complexity you can try to reduce it into something you can manage or you can accept that there isn't a narrative behind these things that are undeniably important.

I can't qualify happiness but I continue to seek it.

When I first met Steve and Alexis, and heard the story of how they originally wanted to create a mobile-food-ordering startup, but were convinced by Paul Graham to create basically a clone of Delicious's popular page instead, I was struck by the dedication they immediately had to an idea that wasn't even originally their own.

1502	"I've lived in both the US and Europe. It is odd seeing what both societies define as ""freedom.""    

In the US the definition is very strictly ""freedom from **government**."" Meaning encroachment from other citizens, corporations, HOAs, and your boss are *fine* but the government tries to pass regulations restricting corporate encroachment and suddenly normal citizens are up in arms (since it is a government ""overreach"" or something).     

In Socialist Europe™ people view government as *theirs* and want to see their government protecting them from encroachment from organizations, corporations, and even other citizens. That's why things like HOAs are more curtailed and subject to oversight in many European countries (i.e. you can take the argument to a higher authority).     

Just interesting social difference. In the US things like the First Amendment are definitely awesome, just wish Americans viewed government and non-governmental encroachments the same way, things would be better. 

"	"This article is a shitty copy/paste of the original [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/business/united-airlines-traveler-help-desk.html) one. The BoingBoing one is paywall free, but has too much context removed to be worth while.    

As an aside, this is why you never add a third party to a transaction if you can avoid it. If you deal directly with the airline the airline has nobody else to blame when something goes wrong, if you add a travel agent the airline will blame them and they will blame the airline leaving you stuck in the middle.   

Recent example of this weaseling: Booked a return flight via Delta.com seven months early. The airline decided to discontinue that route entirely and automatically changed the itinerary (from direct flights to two stops, adding about ten hours of total travel time!). I called up to fix the new shitty itinerary, but in doing so Delta downgraded one of the legs to their Basic Economy class and lost two $75 Delta Comfort upgrades. When I called up to fix that, their initial response was essentially ""there's nothing we can do since you booked via a travel agent, contact them."" Except it was via Delta.com, and after being ""reminded"" of that they suddenly got helpful again.     "	offbeat	offbeat	1

1504	"This is a great example of anecdotal evidence over actual real scientific evidence, and I heavily caution anyone reading this to think critically and do research before following this advice.

Ages 6 to 9 are the perfect age window to broach the subject of Sex, as children have a maximum of curiosity and a minimum of embarrassment about their lack of understanding.

This is a widely accepted fact amongst most child psychologists and is very easy to find information about online.

However, the most important reason for him to be honest goes much deeper than that. Sex is a subject that most people avoid like the plague with their children, and that makes children learn to avoid talking about it with their parents. This is a chance for him to be vulnerable, open, honest, and informative with his daughter. This is his chance to establish himself not only as a resource but also someone who will always be there for advice and for help. 

People who can’t even properly distinguish which They’re/their/there to use at the start of their sentences probably should refrain from giving advice about SERIOUS situations that could have SERIOUS repercussions for a father/daughter relationship forever. 

“They think love is what a family shares, not sexual partners.” Right, let’s say that’s true, then that’s the entire point of having a conversation with the child. You can help them learn what Love is; why it’s so essential prior to Sex, and answer any immediate questions they might have, establishing yourself as a resource on the topic, as open to discuss it, and as a genuine and honest parent.

When you say that you shouldn’t teach someone about a subject because they don’t know the subject yet, it’s a complete oxymoron. Knowledge doesn’t just appear out of nowhere at a set age. It’s not like his daughter will wake up at age 9 and suddenly understand what love between sexual partners is. The entire point of this thread is that his daughter doesn’t exactly understand and he needs to help her get there. Your advice can’t be, oh she doesn’t know A so don’t explain A until she knows A.” Doesn’t make any sense.

I get it. This is the internet and you’re anonymous and so this doesn’t feel real. But I want you to know that following your advice would have had a substantial negative impact comparatively with following expert advice and widely accepted professional and medical opinions about the topic. You could have had an actual, substantial negative effect on a real father and a real daughter and their relationship. It’s not funny to try and bore her out of learning, and it’s not funny to make up fictional age barriers of the understanding of a topic. 

Please think before acting next time."	"So despite overwhelming evidence and a chance to do your own research and learn something new, you’re instead going to make an arbitrary stand and maintain your stance on potentially damaging advice because...?

Makes sense.

Remember when people stopped vaccinating their children using the exact same principles for decision quality as yourself?

Or remember prohibition? Or prohibition again of marijuana?

You should really re-evaluate the standard of morality and ethics you hold yourself to. Willful ignorance and the complicit spread of incorrect information is super damaging for any society. 

It’s also ethically and morally disgusting.

BUT HELL TO EACH THEIR OWN, RIGHT?

Well, honestly, no one will care if you PERSONALLY choose to be stubborn and believe something without researching it or forming a legitimate opinion based on critical thinking. The problem is, just like freedom of speech, when your opinion becomes damaging to those around you, you are not only being willfully ignorant you’re causing harm to real people.

So, in closing:
1. Keep your uneducated and completely arbitrary opinions to yourself before you hurt someone. 
2. Think critically, do some research on morality and ethics, and reevaluate who you want to be in this society. Teach yourself how to change your opinion based on fact. Once you establish a factual and accurate opinion, THEN share it with people."	sex	sex	1
1505	If you think that the power you're giving tyrants won't be used against those you hold most dear, that's naive bullshit. 	"No need to apologize for being rambley- believe me, I’m the last person to be in a position to make that accusation :)

I’d agree that it’s not any internet commenter’s “job” to propose a solution to something they see as a problem. (Although I do think it’s the “job” of an informed citizenry to have a vigorous and open debate about things that matter. The fact that that’s going on here- that it’s not all just two sides calling each other fascists- is a genuinely good thing, and I say that without cynicism. )

So you don’t “need” to say where the line should be when you propose that the line gets drawn. But I *do* think that making a proposal of what it should be is, in itself, more *valuable* than not doing so.

The reason is that it shows that you’ve taken some time to try and think through the consequences, intended and unintended, that that line might mean. It’s harder- because anywhere you stick that line, people will find a way to criticize why you put it there. 

But if you don’t propose putting the line anywhere, you can’t really have a discussion of whether it’s even a good idea or not. Because it ultimately what we’re trying to figure out is, “is the cure to ‘bad speech’ worse than the disease?” If all you’re saying is “someone should come up with a cure,” you can’t even begin that conversation.

1526	"My partner and I live in a neighborhood with less than excellent schools, so last Halloween, we had the idea of dressing up as Jack and Annie from 'The Magic Free House' and giving out books with our candy. We set up in a crowded intersection, splayed all our books out on a few blankets, and let kids  (or their parents if they were young enough), pick a book to take, offering them a piece of candy for their bag as well.

It was a gigantic success! We kind of expected the kids would find it lame, but over 80% of the kids seems really excited by being able to get a book for Halloween, many running off to tell their friends we were there. Older kids seemed especially interested in halloween themed books (the entire Goosebumps collection was gone in about 20 minutes), but we had a huge assortment of genres and difficulty levels so kids could choose something that appealed to them. Over an hour or two, we had distributed our \~200 books to excited and eager children.

I guess in the beginning everyone puts their best foot forward as do I and it’s normal to hit some bumps while getting to know each other.

Even if I’m the one offended she will find a reason to get pissed off about it and I end up being the one offering the olive branch, compromising, or swallowing my pride and taking one for the team. I thought she would notice and appreciate my efforts and maybe realise that she’s being unfair and in some instances a total bitch, but it’s only made matters worse because instead it’s given her some twisted sense of justification: if he’s making peace it must have been his fault.
She is insecure and can not handle any criticism whatsoever but she freely dishes out insults and criticisms. She will jump down my throat for being a bit moody, but if she’s moody she feels completely justified in acting like a bitch and there is zero remorse, on the contrary she takes full ownership of her bitchiness as if it’s her right. She never apologises, makes snide remarks and if I call her out on it and point out how she’s being hypocritical she starts making threats and sweeping statements about my character and how I’m fucked up. If I defend my self, she plays the whole maybe you should leave or maybe this isn’t working card. 
Sometimes I feel like any self respecting guy would just leave, but at the same time I really love her and I feel if I stay calm, compromise and be the bigger person, she might realise and come around. But I’m also human and my feelings get hurt and I feel disrespected. It’s almost like she wants someone who she can shit all over while at the same time wanting that person to be perfect, to never falter or express any kind of negative emotion.

"Not only this, but the limited choice in who you can vote for plus the candidates who are backed by a major party are the ones who will get the most ad time.  Not to mention that the media in which we get our information actively suppress off party choices and candidates who major parties *tell the media to suppress.*  

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/FNnmZuPBSPM) on how exactly the media actively blacked out Ron Paul's presidential run.  Even though he was a solid candidate, with a massive grassroots following, and was polling ahead of nearly every other candidate, due to the media actively suppressing his air time he was effectively demolished as a presidential candidate by simply not allowing him air time and not talking about him. This is the new America. When Americans, while having to work more and having less time to research candidates in full, are not shown their choices in full and with the media's ability to control the outcome of elections almost entirely, we have only the illusion of choice.

Edit:  I would like to add that Trump destroyed this system by being so outlandish that the media had no choice but to talk about him. This is obviously not the tyoe of person we want or need to be president, but it was *kind of* nice to see this fucked up system get a hard slap in the face.

If you really have to break it down into teams (which I would say is a stupid thing to do in the first place) conservatives are far worse on campuses than liberals.

1539	"Your explanation about your perspective (and your background) make perfect sense.  Your comments really have a lot of worth and are.. As I said, really well written.  I found it VERY well organized and clear.

About your fitness, strength, aerobic, and ""learn to hit and get hit"" anf ""learn to roll on the mat""...  The best instructor started every lesson and all homework on fitness.. Then learning to get hit and hit.  Forge your body, experience it all...

I 100% agree.  I haven't practiced anything for 14 years. I ""look"" fit fo4 a mid 30s man.. But have an aortic anyeurism, connective tissue disorder (cool! Long reach and,crazy flexibility!  Not,cool,once older..), and frankly I can't keep my fitness up.

I do agree though!  I did kempo, tae kwon do. Then a but of what was tae kwon do... But instructor was awesome...  BIG on fitness first, teaching us deeper shit than fighting about being a 'man' we choose....  He got me in good shape my first time.  Then he was an odd guy.  Very very dedicated to 3 or 4 martial arts, taught us pieces of each and about ourselves and adversity, etc... 

I'm grateful for the full contact sparring, the focus on ""last resort"" weapon or enemy moves focusing on joints, organs, and bones that quickest eliminate the threat- if you can't RUN or fight as needed TO RUN.

I didn't realize until this thread how much even what little practice I had an,impact on me. (Insomuch, it gave me clues I had a connective tissue disorder, weird arm/leg length and flexibility.. And an ignorable pain tolerance from.... Always.. But I didn't know all these other ""tougher"" guys with boxing,and,other training,that seemed,so,confident.... I could,usually,stop, take down, and submit or choke out (these were guys volunteering and practicing in our class too)... Shit was really useful to my own ""becoming,a,man"" process, and helped me now and then in bad situations since.

That honestly you're right.  I AM NOT a martial artist, but luckily my teacher that had the. Biggest impact taught to run, or fuck,them,up till you can..  Or plenty of full contact sparring and grappling to ""get comfortable"".  I'm nothing, but even being somewhat comfortable with hit, getting hit, defense, the awareness of running (and no ego escalations- since we ""can fight"" it just is our last plan since we know what that means...

I think all young men NEED those experiences, but between kempo, and 2 or 3 other ""arts"" (I only,got,cursory lessons in from,my instructor) I mastered NONE, but learned about myself along the way.

 I think THE INSTRUCTOR (sensei, or whatever), and a person's need, money, convenience......  More than ""what art""- having a really amazing instructor and peers and higher ups to climb toward and hopefully beating...  (To me.. This was before ""MMA"" gyms, but a good instructor, and instruction best for you and your potential opponents' striking, take down, grappling... Etc.

Any is HUGE compared,to none...  Least my lack of experience or mastery in ""martial,arts"" taught me,to,not,fight for,ego... To,run.. And the confidence or knowledge of violence,(giving,or,receiving) and my limits.

I think every young man, my son included if he does it for him..  Should test themselves.  Learn some standup and grappling...  Even if I never had used it- taught and helped me a ton learning the man I was.

Great posts man.  I really am getting excited about this stuff again,  I have A 4 year old.. But have a 13 year old now from my girl here.  I wasn't ready to share that level of stuff He's at.. And to me it's best with groundwork and foundation.  But I have been thinking more on this as well,the last year.  I'm just not as learned, varied, or experienced qs you.  Still from my limited experience, I completely agree!

Now that I have a bad anyeurism (amd oir regular stuff) I've been thinking of amd wishing I could get into something again- also with the feeling unlike before I will fight or run as if one punch is going to kill me now..  Since it could, and I'm a father.

Also I really miss it and having three boys it is a thing I hope they get into if possible.  It really meant a lot to me as a teen and young adult to ""learn"" part of who I was on accident while learning to fight and competing with peers and whatnot.

1550	"&gt; Naruto was an orphan with barely any reason to live, much less work hard. He could only perform the Taju Kage Bunshin because he pushed himself for Iruka's sake (after Iruka showed him more love than he had ever gotten his entire life)

He learned Kage Bunshin after Mizuki told him to steal the scroll, I just re-read the chapter. At that point he was just trying to graduate. Naruto has natural talent, and when he works hard he gets places, he never worked hard cause he didn't take it seriously. Iruka didn't tell him he acknowleged him until after he found him, which was after he learned the jutsu.

&gt;The people who retake the exam three times or so still have to put in more work and or time into passing. It's not like they're getting a free pass for doing it over and over again. You could argue it was unfair if they got a pass for determination but that isn't how it works, the people who took the exam once will still have put in exponentially less effort (or time if the people retaking were just too lazy to learn it at once) than the people retaking. Not everyone fails because they didn't work hard, people who put in as much work as others still fail because they don't have a natural predisposition towards what they're working to achieve. Especially in the case of ninjutsu which some can barely even use at all. It's perfectly fair

Alright, why don't we do this in real life? I would love to re-take my physics final twice and use the best grade I got. I would love to be able to slack knowing if I failed I'd get another shot! Yeah don't have a natural predisposition for something but that doesn't mean they should get more opportunities than someone who does? Maybe this is an asshole argument but if I failed my physics exam I would not be able to continue into the next level physics class and it woulda fucked up my schedule for next year, but if I didn't get a passing grade it means I'm not ready for the next year! Now I'm not saying Naruto doesn't deserve to be a ninja, he clearly is talented for learning a Jonin level technique in one day from it being his worst technique! But it's not fair to other students who work hard and pass the first time if you give one student who didn't work as hard more opportunities to succeed because they are not as good at the material. No wonder most of the ninjas in the War arc were comlete trash compared to any of the named characters. They get babied.

In real life I'd be pissed if someone got to retake a test cause they failed. There's no indication Naruto got favouritism because he's an orphan, there's also no evidence he worked hard before the test, he coulda been studying instead of painting the Hokages faces after all!

&gt;Especially in the case of ninjutsu which some can barely even use at all. It's perfectly fair.

Here's the thing, you put a guy who is not ready to be a ninja on the battle field, that guy is dead. You hold him back, give him more time in the Academy, train him up a bit, maybe he becomes skilled enough to live and be an asset instead of dying and being a waste. We are talking about military training, not physics tests, if I passed my test cause I got to retry it twice demonstrating I was not as good as my peers at all, it doesn't matter cause I wouldn't find a job anyway. As we saw in Naruto's first mission even D rank missions can be life or death, and if someone passed who needed way more assistance than someone else, it's likely they'd die. Naruto almost died on his mission and he knew a jutsu that was better than Bunshin, but imagine if he had just passed that last time, then he would have been completely useless, and that's a liability in military operations.

Yeah, again I know. Tell that to the doctor who didn't believe I had T2 anymore and tried to tell me I was ""cured."" He was a dumbass and I stopped going to him. That was the second doctor.

&gt;Your doctor isn't garbage, he's just following recommendations from things that have actual, randomized controlled science behind them.

It's a she, and I stopped seeing her and said what I did because she was completely unhelpful. She had no info or advice for me other than to hand me a pamphlet on the Mediterranean diet (which is full of pasta and stuff, high carb). She wasn't following ""actual, randomized controlled science,"" as you put it. She did next to nothing at all.

I did all the research, reduced carbs, started exercising regularly. When I told her the steps I was taking on a follow up visit, she insisted I do otherwise, and that I was going to damage my body. Six months after that when my A1c was dramatically down and I'd dropped a good bit of weight (and my blood work was all perfectly good and in order), she then said ""oh yeah, good job"" and when my wife came in for a completely unrelated illness (stage 2 hypertension) the doc just said ""oh, just do what he's doing"" not considering that the diet I was on wasn't necessarily ideal for my wife and her condition, and that it was an entirely different ailment.

&gt;Keto doesnt have that yet.

I'm not doing keto. I did that for all of 7 weeks as I noted to eliminate carb cravings and drastically reduce my blood sugar to closer to normal levels, and then slowly reintroduced carbs to my diet, rigorously testing how individual carbs and starches affected my blood sugar over a period of something like 8 months. I've been managing this illness since 2013 at this point and am in good health.

Technically speaking, eucaloric intake of carbohydrates is not stored as fat, but will be oxidized for fuel as glycogen (that's where the aforementioned resistance training helps, as glycogen is a primary component of the repair process for muscles). *Excess* carbohydrates above TDEE will be stored as fat.

In the absence of carbohydrates, the body will convert fat for energy, hence why low carb diets tend to work, but in the end it's still calories in calories out as the most important component. 

The types of fats and carbohydrates matter too. Sugars and simple carbs (starches, flour, stuff like that) will cause insulin spikes and tend to cause an increase in triglycerides, whereas a healthy caloric diet with healthier fats and complex carbohydrates correlate with a decrease in triglycerides and HDL (""good"" cholesterol).

-----

So take it as you will. The above diet (high fat, moderate protein, low carb) probably just worked for me because fats tend to be more physically dense and satisfying per caloric intake than carbohydrates, and are therefore easier to moderate. Combined with the probability of imperfect calorie counting and food cravings (eating sugar and carbs tends to make you crave more carbs, particularly in foods with HFCS), a higher fat, lower carb diet is simply easier to maintain when trying to lose weight, or was for me."

1556	"Yes, praising a torturing God is morally reprehensible. What I find confusing is why Atheists tend to believe in that God.

I never hear Atheists argue about the immorality of praising the God of children laughing and sunsets and people doing great things together or seeing flowers grow. Atheists never seem to believe in that God--they never believe that that is what a lot of us mean by God, that's all it is.

They always believe in the Bearded Racketeer, the exact same God the Fundamentalists believe in. And nothing wrong with that, you know, I don't care what people believe. But for spiritualists (including many Christians and Muslims), the Bearded Racketeer isn't real, and we are only aware of ""Him"" when Fundamentalists and Atheists take turns describing ""Him."""	"No, I certainly wouldn't make that argument. But the idea of what I a bit playfully call a racketeering God--a God who creates Hell and enumerates sin and sends people to Hell unless they turn to him to save them from what he's going to do if they don't -- I think that that un-nuanced, linear, all-or-none understanding of God is very much the domain of Fundamentalism, as we use to he word today (cf when we first started using the word, when Fundamentalism was simply a movement to shed tradition and writ that wasn't strictly Scripturally based... but again I'd argue that that un-nuanced understanding of symbolism and cultural evolution led directly to the simplistic God of Fundamentalists and Atheists).

Obviously many non-Fundamentalists believe in a sort of literal afterlife Hell. The understanding of how people could end up there is more nuanced -- as many of the posters in this thread are eloquently demonstrating."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Women were ""drafted"" in the sense that they were conscripted into war work by the Ministry of Labour, including non-combat jobs in the military, such as the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS or ""Wrens""), the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF or ""Waffs"") and the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). Auxiliary services such as the Air Transport Auxiliary also recruited women.[23] In the early stages of the war such services relied exclusively on volunteers, however by 1941 conscription was extended to women for the first time in British history and around 600,000 women were recruited into these three organizations.[24] In these organizations women performed a wide range of jobs in support of the Army, Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy both overseas and at home. These jobs ranged from traditionally feminine roles like cook, clerk and telephonist to more traditionally masculine duties like mechanic, armourer, searchlight[25] and anti-aircraft instrument operator.[24] British women were not drafted into combat units, but could volunteer for combat duty in anti-aircraft units, which shot down German planes and V-1 missiles.[26][27] Civilian women joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which used them in high-danger roles as secret agents and underground radio operators in Nazi occupied Europe.[28]"	"I dont care if the characters are male, female, or a three-headed frog.

During the game, when it became more apparently that Iowa was using this set way more often than they predicted, Schiano tried to make some in-game adjustment. Unfortunately, the coaches couldn’t explain the differences well on the fly, and the players were not recognizing how to respond quickly enough either."	"Blew their load?

In my mind, the reason for this is because she has something specific in mind that she is working towards and that ""the Alliance is gonna start a war someday"" is just an excuse to further her own plans.

1579	"Thank you!

I know that the X-100 is not a simple point and click type of camera but I was under the impression that since it's a single lens camera it'd be easier to use than the X-T cameras, but thanks for pointing out, it's appreciated!

And thanks for the suggestion about the camera, seems like that I'll have to shell out more money, better we stop or I will end up with an X-T2 :'("	"Hi everyone!

I'm planning to buy a camera, mainly to take pics when I travel but also as a general camera for all uses (family gatherings, some street photograph etc.). So something lightweight and good for casual use. I am still undecided between two Fuji products, the **X-100F or the X-T20**.  
I read extensively about pros and cons and it just boils down to the question if I want something simpler, lighter, and ready ""out of the box"" but not extensible, or something which requires more study, light but slightly heavier (once you add lenses), but also more flexible because of the interchangeable lenses.  
And of course the price is another big factor since the X-T20 with 18-55 + 35mm (the setup I would go for), is 40% more expensive (~€1,400 vs €1,000), so I will also have to think about this. None of these two cameras has weather sealing but you can't have it all.

I'd like to know your thoughts about it and also ask you some help about something probably silly for you: **what else should I buy, what accessories, as a total newbie?**

I would like to start slow, buy only the necessary stuff, and build from there. And, as mentioned, I plan to use it for travelling (I'll travel soon) and for a general use. I know that according to the camera I choose some stuff can be more or less useful but I think that there are some accessories which are considered a *must buy*, it doesn't matter the skills level or the usage.

These are my first thoughts / questions:

* **Memory card**: this is a no brainer, unless I want to use the camera as a paperweight. I put my eyes on a Sandisk Extreme Pro U3 128GB for €70. I think that for my usage one card for now is enough, but I could go for two in case, what do you think?
* **Battery**: Do I really need an extra battery? Or one is enough considering the casual use? Also, I have difficulties to find a compatible NP-W126S here, I guess that the older NP-W126 is not good, right?
* **Tripod**: Should I go for a small, cheap, tripod for my use? Or can I pass on for now? Say I go for an hike, do you see any real utility or at least for now it's wasted money? I've also the same doubt about a possible remote :-)
* **Bag**: I plan to use mainly my backpack so I am not looking for a backpack just for the camera, any suggestions for a small bag? Possibly something I could use with my backpacks, to keep the camera, and in case I go for the X-T20 the couple of lenses (general advices are welcome, no need for specific models in case since they could be hard to find here);

Am I missing anything? Do I need hoods, filters, cases...? Really, anything you could think of.  
Just keeping in mind that this is for an amateur who's looking for the basic equipment, I'm not keen on spending already hundreds of Euros in equipment which maybe I won't even use much, or which is not necessary at least at the beginning.  
Googling on some sites, it seems like *everything* is necessary and no wonder it's like that, since all the articles link to affiliate accounts.

The number of people who would have lost the right to vote from these laws was ~1000-10000x as many as the number of cases of voter fraud.

It's this discretion that falls heavily against men in the courtroom. 

&gt;The 28 year old guy who meets the same girl at a 21+ nightclub and has sex with needs to be informed that he's a fucking idiot and turned loose.

Are you assuming that he knew she was underage or not in this example? If he knew, he's knowingly having sex with a minor (JV age), and if he didn't know, why does he need to be called an idiot? He should have every reasonable expectation of finding legal women in a legal bar. Or are we needing to card our one night stands now?

Edit: Again, not that I fully disagree with you. Discretion on the part of the prosecutors to say that a man who unknowingly had sex with a minor should be let free, if we're basing this on the fact he was legitimately duped. Proving that is a hell of a tall order though.

I also agree that an arbitrary age for consent in sexual matters is an awkward thing to try to get around. What's the real difference between 17 1/2 and 18 mentally, for example? I can't see another way around this, though. An argument of ""Well, Your Honor, I know she's underage but she's really, *really,* mature for her age"" doesn't seem like a reasonable applicable standard.   


The question becomes this, then. Correct me if I am wrong, but he was under the legal age of consent, correct? If so, it is statutory rape by definition.

I also really like [this](http://www.dlsite.com/eng/work/=/product_id/RE141995.html) Touhou fangame. I've noticed a lot of the stuff from there has been coming to other platforms lately, but not everything.

There are also a ton of Touhou fangames that can be pretty fun even if you aren't into Touhou. [Here's](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Category:Fangames) a pretty good list from the Touhou wiki. If you go to one of the pages you can see the list of games by genre at the bottom. Being a fan of metroidvanias I really liked [Touhouvania 2](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Koumajou_Densetsu_II:_Stranger%27s_Requiem). I also had a lot of fun with [Tempest of Heaven and Earth](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Tenjou_no_Tempest) even though I couldn't read anything when I played it.

Another good way to find some games is to look at whatever was at the latest Comiket. [This](http://edelweiss.skr.jp/) is a good site for some info on Japanese indie games. They have a long video with a bunch of the games that were at Comiket for each event. [Here's](http://edelweiss.skr.jp/info/c87pv/index.html) an example of one that I had bookmarked; you can click on the pictures on the sidebar to skip to them in the video or you can just let it play if you've got time.

Other than that you can just try to find some forums. I'm not going to link to the ones I look at since they usually also have download links which would be against the rules of the sub, but they can be a great source of information and aren't too hard to find by just google searching ""&lt;Comiket you're interested in&gt; games list"".

Like I said before Twitch can be a good place to find some of these types of games as well. If you scroll down far enough in the Speedrunning community you'll probably find a few and there are usually at least one or two present at GDQ events.

For one last recommendation I'll say [Grief Syndrome](https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Grief_Syndrome) (I hope that link isn't breaking any rules) is pretty decent and I had fun with it for a while.

Edit: I forgot about IWBTG fangames since I don't like them very much, but there are (used to be?) a lot of them. I don't remember where the best place to find them is, but [delicious-fruit](https://delicious-fruit.com/) came up from a quick search and I remember seeing that site a long time ago so it might be that one."	I wouldn't say cheese strategies are necessarily zero skill. They certainly can take near-zero mechanical skill, but in order for them to work (outside of balance issues anyways) you need to exploit the other players expectations about how the game works. If some cheese is working really well then other people are going to start doing it and players should learn how to avoid it. Maybe you can get a few wins in before that by just copying the cheese strat, but once people start adapting to it then you need to as well and if you can't then it isn't necessarily that the cheese stopped working but that you were too bad to recognize how you needed to adapt it.

ok so let's do that. Jamaica has more restrictive gun laws but higher gun crime. as does Honduras and other countries.

clearly it isn't the exact same story because access to guns is not the cause of violence and the stats prove that.

I ignore your new statement because it was a blatant attempt to move the goal post and frame the argument in a different way because you don't want to admit you were wrong and that it is a far more complex problem than that.

You can query across relations super easily (combined with Rails' ORM, you have automatic JOINs). You can cache by relation and type info. In fact, GraphQL is arguably more suited to complex data relations that REST. REST is essentially one route, one batch of data. Want data from two different routes? Gotta make two different requests. Want only part of a route's data? Well, you have to implement some sort of query args that filter or limit the results (at which point, you have a buggy, half implemented version of GraphQL).

The place where GraphQL still sucks is authentication and authorization. Getting a decent auth flow with a JWT still feels like pulling teeth. But hopefully that'll be fixed in the near future."

And she doesn't seem to have much respect for you. Forget the pets, I think a wedding is a really bad idea.

I mean, I get it, I'm a dog lover. I made it clear to my now-husband when we started dating that I'm a dog person and I always want to have a dog (so, basically, if he wasn't into that, he should walk). He was fine with it, but certainly not the dog lover I was. After we bought a house, I did start to ask him about a timeline for getting a dog. He didn't want to get one right away and kind of dragged his feet, which annoyed me (I worked from home, we had a house with a fenced yard, it was a perfect situation for a dog). But I didn't act like a little shit to get what I wanted. We picked out our dog together and trained her together and he's absolutely in love with her now (he calls her ""my baby"" even though she's elderly now ... and, ya know, not a baby). These kind of things are joint decisions. If she wants pets and you don't, you're incompatible.

So while it can also be argued against (that it's related, not that it's decreasing), I wouldn't say it's so completely off subject that it should be downvoted, and in fact I find the downvotes more akin to someone mentioning something that people don't want to hear and people's response to be covering their ears and repeating loudly ""LA LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU."""	"I'm not referring to peaks at all. First of all, comparing to the very beginning of Dota 2 being counted on Steam is far from a realistic way to assess anything. Dota 2 was still in beta at that point. Since release, it's more like 40% up. But OP said Dota has a decreasing player base and I said he's right. That has absolutely nothing to do with peaks or with how many players were playing the first month it was on Steam or released. It can be more players than it had the first month and still have a currently shrinking player base. Honestly, the mental gymnastics you guys are doing here to try to avoid looking at the reality of the situation is pretty incredible (not to mention the downvotes because obviously that's easier than accepting a fact you'd rather not). And I'm not saying this because I'm a Dota hater, I've been watching Dota 2 since TI1 and playing since October 2012. I still play and watch all the time but I can also be realistic:

**1 Year** 

Average players - June 2017 555,289.1 | June 2018 473,900.0 - 15% decrease.

**6 Months**

Average players - December 2017 513,074.3 | June 2018 473,900.0 - 8% decrease.

**1 Month**

Average players - May 2018 474,325.9 | June 2018 473,900.0 - a decrease of 426.

By every metric, the player base is decreasing. Now, I can admit that if we did the one-month comparison in a different month this year, it would have very slightly increased rather than decreased, but obviously gradual trends are harder to measure in the short term. But the average has never even hit 500k this year, whereas it originally hit 500k in November of 2014 and never went below 500k again until less than a year ago. Honestly, there is absolutely no possibility that you can claim that Dota 2's playerbase isn't shrinking.

22	"  I've been lurking on this sub for over a year now, never thought anything would ever happen to me that I would end up posting here... until tonight.
  
  Today was freakishly warm, up to 72 degrees where I'm at, when we've had (mostly) nothing but cold, dreary weather recently. So, being the ride-even-in-sub-freezing-temperatures motorcycle guy that I am, I decided to take another ride, this time at night. 

  Started off being a great ride, there were tons of motorcycles out taking advantage of the weather and I was just heading back to my house when I fucked up;

  On the stretch to my house, I'm cruising at the speed limit enjoying the scenery, when all the sudden a car with bright lights comes right up to my ass, and stays there.  Being a motorcycle rider that enjoys keeping his license, I typically don't speed over the standard 5 over, and every day you'll have cars riding your ass, seemingly because they assume since you're on a sportbike, you should be going fast. Well, this happend to me all throughout the day, and now this car was really pissing me off..

  About half a mile down the road, they're still on my ass. Way too close. Obnoxiously close. I've had enough of this today, and I snapped. I nailed the throttle, and took off like a rocket down the road, just to show my ass and maybe get the message across they need to give me some space. Once I've gone a few times over the speed limit, I look in my mirror, and see the flashing blues...

At this point Im literally just a few hundred feet from my house, which is pure figurative insult to injury. I immediately stopped, and waited to see what terrible things were about to transpire... until me and the officer got talking, I explained what I *thought* had been going on, and get handed a ticket totaling around 100$ for not having a tag light... that was it. 

  The worst part is I never do this. I'm always the calm rider who does everything in my power to not be ""*one of those*"" motorcycle riders. I had just been tailgated so close, so many times today, that I snapped... and the *only* time I do this, it happens to be a cop. Fortunately, I was let of extremely easily. If he wanted to he could have ruined my world. Let this also be a lesson to other riders; when its warm and other riders are out, the *bad* riders are also out, and cops are likely to assume you may be one of them. Ride safe! (And smart!)

TL;DR: Got tailgated, wanted to show my ass and sped off on my motorcycle to send a message - tailgater turned out to be a cop, but I only got a minor ticket. "	Considering there were no cars (visible at least) for a quarter mile or more in either direction on the road leading to mine, I honestly think he had seen me from faaaar away and hauled some serious ass to get to me. To my best estimates with the distance he had to travel he had to have been doing at least 80 in a 45, I didn't see him hiding anywhere and there really isnt anywhere to hide there anyway so that's my best explanation. He played dirty, but so did I, I guess. 	tifu	tifu	1

25	"&gt;Arguing that illegal immigration is akin to trespassing on private property is assuming all of the United States is your private property, which evidently isn't true. What if your legal immigrant neighbor wants to bring his family to live in his privately owned house? What part of the NAP is violated then? It certainly isn't trespassing unless you think you have more right to your neighbor's home than he does.

You started out with ""illegal"" then ended up arguing with ""legal"". I never said that the entire US is MY property. I argue that a nation has territory. If you're arguing for abolishing all nation-state borders in the world, just say it.

The few basic functions of a government are to define and defend property rights, defend against foreign aggression, protect its citizens against each other, and adjudicate disputes, within its border. If it isn't allowed to assume a border, the necessary qualifier for all those functions would vanish.

&gt;As long as the immigrants privately pay for their housing and support, then I don't really have a problem with it.

Neither do I have a problem with it. But how would you achieve this ideal? It's easy to just state an ideal.

I support your ideal. But I have to disagree with your approximation.

Free movement and commerce between the states have been beneficial. But there's also another sense in which open borders between the states has not been beneficial. That is, people in one state have to subsidize people in another state through federal programs and mandates. There's also rent-seeking competition between the states at the federal level. Moreover, the expansion of federal government and centralization of power have continued to usurp individual state local power and autonomy and those of the people within it.

Those same concerns exist when considering open borders between countries. The US citizens will have to carry the burden of the foreigners. As the foreigners gain political power in the country, they have the incentive to favor central government policies that don't respect economic freedom.

One of the fundamental problems is zero-sum political game. If the number of people where you live increases, you have less and less say in your own freedom. You better make sure they don't have the incentive to infringe your liberty.

The soldiers of the Confederate army did not all own slaves but they were all citizens of the United States: many of them supported slavery, most probably, but this does not mean they fought and died eagerly, nor does it mean that their names should be forgotten. Even in Germany today, there are still monuments to the fallen Wehrmacht soldiers of the Nazi regime - because they are seen to be as much victims of Hitler's depravities as anyone else.	Do you agree that all Confederate monuments should not be treated the same? There are monuments dedicated to individuals and there are those dedicated to unnamed soldiers or the Confederate army.

And B we have no evidence for a perfect God. We have evidence of an expanding universe. 	"Hold tight because this will get inherently confusing. For one it kind of requires that you understand mathematically the idea of infinity. Have you ever done those math curves in school where the line approaches zero but never actually touches zero? That's kind of what this is like. The universe isn't finite. So it's not expanding into anything it's already set it's limit as infinity (as far as we understand now if this changes well that will be a very interesting day in science ☺). In all reality think of it more like a balloon. The universe is the surface of the balloon.

51	"&gt;What are you looking for from me?

You chose to link the definition of a product recall to me. I asked why. You said Apple doesn't do recalls. I pointed out that they tried to avoid this when possible but had recalled in the past. You said that the fact that they had not recalled the butterfly keyboard defects because it is not a safety issue. I pointed out that I agreed with this, but nothing would stop Apple from issuing a recall on the butterfly keyboard if they saw fit, and choosing whether or not to do any sort of out-of-warranty replacement/repair policy was their choice.

&gt;The language Apple chooses to use is combed over by lawyers and I’m sure they are good ones.

No kidding. Most multibillion dollar electronics companies have good legal advice.

&gt;Apple didn’t design it to fail

Doesn't mean that a defect doesn't exist. GM didn't design their ignition to be defective, Fitbit didn't design the Fitbit Surge to cause Allergic reactions. NVIDIA didn't design the G84/G86 GPUs to fail either, but they did, and Apple and other manufacturers did extended repair policies (outside of a formal recall) on them.

&gt;there are external factors that can cause these failures

Of course. However, the number of reports I have heard anecdotally (personally, online, etc.) suggests to me that it isn't just people being abusive. Longtime Mac buyers I know personally who take very good care of their hardware have had issues. Other people ITT report the same, and it's not just reddit - check other forums and news articles.

Apple historically has not admitted to every problem immediately, choosing to ignore some, and then offer extended support on others.

&gt;Apple knows the number of people having the issue vs the sale numbers of each model.

Going back to the lazy Fight club economics example of car recalls (or the real life example of the GM recall), Apple ultimately chooses whether or not they will do extended field service for a product/part, and if it's economically worth it. They may or may not, whether or not an actual problem exists.

This isn't a criticism of Apple individually. The [capacitor plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague) bit a lot of computers and electronics in the 2000s. Most motherboard or other consumer electronics manufacturers chose not to extend coverage, both Apple and elsewhere. [The original time capsule was bit by the capacitor plague](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/19/time_capsule_death/), among other Apple products. While this constituted a legitimate defect (due to the bad caps), Apple generally chose not to service affected products outside the original warranty terms - despite them all being ticking time bombs.

Your original reply was the definition of product recall, for reasons that are still unclear.

I totally agree Apple has not recalled the keyboard, which was the point of my original post (field service actions are cheaper and at your own discretion on how widely you service or if you choose to issue them in the first place).

**EDIT**: Your comment history suggests that you claim to be an Apple tech; if true, then your experience is worth something, but so are the experiences of other techs ([example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8g4pb7/why_isnt_apple_recalling_the_20162017_macbook_pros/dy9fgy8/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8g4pb7/why_isnt_apple_recalling_the_20162017_macbook_pros/dy999rp/))."	"Safety issues **or** product defects. Apple has had mooing Macbooks in the mid-00s, Macbook Pros with video issues, etc. constituting product defects, even if Apple does not title them recalls.

Your assertion that Apple ""doesn't have recalls"" is also factually incorrect as [Apple called this a recall](https://www.apple.com/support/ac-wallplug-adapter/) and [it was legally a recall under US law](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2016/apple-recalls-travel-adapter-kits-and-plugs)."	apple	apple	1

As for your thoughts on inflation, I believe the most common inflation statistics are drawn from CPI.  CPI being drawn from the cost of things like clothing, meds, food, etc.  It is by no means a perfect measure of inflation, but is likely to be one of the more accurate measures and directly affects the average person. 

The term bubble often gets tossed around a little too much and is a little difficult to describe.  Essentially a bubble is when an asset is being traded for significantly more than it is worth.  The housing bubble was created over investment in bad real estate.  The .com bubble was over investment in the internet etc.  Bubbles aren't necessary for a recession, but can be trigger in some cases.  

Right now, I think the biggest drivers for a potential recession are likely the trade war or student debt, but this is entirely conjecture and I haven't done as much research into this as I would like.

For starters it claims that people that to only compare relatively wealthy countries is racist. Those countries have high crime rates because they've gotten the short end of the stick during colonialism. This caused high amounts of poverty and inequality. I find this argument highly hypocritical as libertarians are very often for neocolonial methods. To get back to the point. The article also claims that other highly industrialised countries are more homogenous. While this is true for some east asian countries it really doesn't hold true for Europe. If we look at highly heterogenous countries like Belgium or Switzerland the murder rates are significantly lower. If you subtract suicide from the murder rates the United States are still significantly high. 

Also the article compares Turkey to the USA. Other than Turkey having a bit of a lower standard of life due to a rough 20th century it has very liberal firearms laws. Overall the article claims that so many countries have banned firearms even though they only have gun control. Just to end this I want to remind you that mass shootings by far don't happen as often anywhere in the EU. They used to in some countries. Then they tightened gun control.

And no one claims that the US is bad on an international scale. It has its good sides. But if you compare violent crime rates there to the rates in countries with similar standards of life you notice certain problems. A lot stem from the rampant inequality."	news	news	1

**23-Oct-2013 - Conflict of interest: Milne’s $1.5m in Telstra shares**
&gt;Mr Milne still owns 305,000 Telstra shares, worth about $1.5 million at Tuesday's closing price of $5.01, according to a search of the company's share registry by Fairfax Media on Monday. The shares appear to be part of Telstra's 2006 and 2010 bonus program and were no longer restricted.

&gt;For those who need reminding, currently the rules regarding with Telstra are broadly that foreign ownership of the telco is limited to 35 percent, with individual foreign investors only allowed to own up to five percent. As I wrote just last week, do I think this rule should be reviewed? No. Clearly, in Australia, Telstra has no problems competing against its rivals and is, in fact, dominant in the market.

80	"So 7 months ago my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me in a terrible way, he's been an asshole, I've basically moved on but he has been strange to me. Last I head from him was when I texted saying ""i wish we could end on better terms"" he replied ""stop talking to me""

Anyways, before we started dating, I had a little fling with his best friend -- very accidental, just happened to like each other a lot, strange situation. It was almost like a ""who do i choose"" situation, but they both were fully aware of the situation, so there was no lying and I feel like, while unfortunate, it wasn't necessarily super immoral. Anyways, we didn't go very far, but during the course of my relationship with ex, we have been good friends.

Break up happens, his best friend is very much there to take care of ex, he acts as a liaison when needed between ex and I. He was a really good guy during break up, cheering ex up, etc.

I see them out the other week, I say hi to the friend and he tells me ex forbids us to speak (Even though I consider him a good friend). Kind of sucks, but whatever.

I see the friend the next week. Ex isn't there. We finally get to talk after 6 months. At first, it is just friendly talk about random stuff, then we get to talk a little bit about how he thought my ex was terrible in the break up and that he is sorry, etc. Then, the drunker we get, the convo evolves into something else. He tells me he misses me, confesses how much he liked me when I was with ex, and that he wants to ask me out in the future when things have calmed down. One thing leads to another and we end up having sex. It was great, and while drunk we say that we want to continue to do this, secretly (obviously not a sober idea).

He texts me the next day saying basically ""that was great. also really terrible, lets forget about it and move on."" I agree. It's fucked up to continue.

I see him out this week. He pretends I don't exist. My issue is that, if you sleep with a friend, yeah, it might be awkward. Maybe there has always been sexual tension and now that we have had sex, he isn't into me anymore. Maybe he just feels too guilty for sleeping with his best friends ex (of course he does). Maybe he thinks saying hi to me will lead to sex again. However, besides all of those perfectly understandable reasons to feel awkward or not want to really speak to me, is it not the decent thing to do, that after you have sex with someone who is supposed to be a friend, can you at least acknowledge them and make eye contact, smile, say hi?? something?

Am I an asshole for sleeping with my exs best friend, after my ex was terrible to me, and after years of liking the guy (I have no real loyalty to my ex anymore, but should I)? Is he an asshole for doing it, since he has always liked me and now I am available, and my ex chose not to be with me? Is he being an asshole to me by not saying hi, or should I be more understanding? Does my ex have every right to forbid us to speak to each other, forbid us being friends?

**tldr; I slept with ex's best friend, we have liked each other forever, but now the best friend is pretending I dont exist. Ex also has forbidden him to speak to me/be friends with me. Ex doesn't know we like eachother. Who is the asshole? Ex, best friend, me? All of us?**"	"No he wasn't. He was with another friend that had seen us talking the night of the hook up, and this guy told him ""i think you're being a bad friend by talking to her"" basically. So maybe he was trying to hide the fact that we hooked up? avoid more criticism? 
but yeah thats the original reason i posted -- was this guy an asshole for not saying hi? Like once you sleep with someone, especially someone you have known a while, isn't there some kind of politeness owed, at least? "	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	1

""Anglo-Saxon capitalism's drive to maximize profits in the short term won't save the planet.  Perhaps the Chinese model can?

But the answer to the question in it is no.

In the following quote we can see a false assertion:

 ""Decarbonisation of the economy requires alternatives for coal and cars  that run on diesel, and that plays to capitalism’s strengths.  Innovation is what capitalism is all about, and there has been  staggeringly rapid progress in developing clean alternatives to coal,  oil and gas.""

As the author already stated, maximizing the amount of trade widgets is what Capitalism is about.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"", an old saying many are probably familiar with.

 That would be more along the lines of why there has been rapid progress  in developing clean alternatives.  We find our survival to be a  necessity, so it is helping to motivate us to develop these other  technologies.

These technologies have been around for quite a  while now, such as hydroelectric and wind power and we could have been  developing them all along, but corruption and the drive for profits by a  greedy subgroup have held them back.

""Great advances are also  being made in battery technology, which is vital for the new generation  of electricity-powered vehicles.""

Sure, it may be ""important""  now, but what really held back development in the past?  Could it have  been the profit making technique of Planned Obsolescence?  Could be...

 ""And, more than anything, it means accepting that the world needs to  wage war against climate change. Powerful vested interests will say  there is plenty of time to act, and they are aided by climate-change  deniers who say there is nothing to worry about. These people need to be  called out. They are not deniers, they are climate-change appeasers.  And they are just as dangerously misguided as fascism’s appeasers in the  1930s.""

100	"I'm now 8-0 posting on this thread after going [4-0 last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/9mgoo2/week_6_betting_discussion_thread/e7ewc6c/?context=3) and [4-0 the week before](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/9ki4t2/week_5_betting_discussion_thread/e6zezq2/), so hopefully the sub magic continues.

* Auburn +4 (@Ole Miss): This line is too low (should be at least 7) and is a clear overreaction to Auburn's loss to Tennessee. Yes Auburn's offense has been anemic at times lately, but Ole Miss is the perfect prescription for a struggling offense (especially with the # of injuries Ole Miss has had on defense) and Auburn's defense is still insanely good (#2 overall defense on S&amp;P+) and going against an Ole Miss offense that just lost WR DK Metcalf for season. You should take this line before it moves even further this week (I got it at -3 when it opened yesterday).
* Nebraska -3.5/4 (Minnesota): Two reasons I really like this spread. First, when Martinez is healthy Nebraska has played at a much higher level than their record might indicate, and Nebraska really should have beaten both Colorado and @Northwestern from a win expectancy standpoint. Second, and I refer to this as ""trench warfare theory"": teams are more likely to struggle the week after facing Ohio State/Clemson/Alabama, and my theory has always been the OL gets worn out through attrition (along with probably getting hyped up for a big game and giving it your all etc. etc.). Some examples of this include Syracuse (lost 44-37 @Pitt after their close loss @Clemson), Texas A&amp;M (followed up their loss @Alabama with an ugly 24-17 win over Arkansas), Arkansas (after playing well against Alabama they blew the lead in the 4Q this week at home to Ole Miss), TCU (followed their loss to Ohio State by losing decisively 31-16 @Texas), and Indiana (Played pretty well in a 49-26 loss @tOSU, and then was murdered by Iowa this week 42-16). Minnesota is good, and the line is pretty much spot-on value wise as these two teams are about even overall, but I like Nebraska in this spot.
* Michigan -7 (@Michigan State):  Yes Dantonio is scary, yes Michigan State has been unpredictable, and yes, MSU's ATS is insane against Michigan the last 10 years or so. That said, this line should be -10. Michigan is just a much better team this year, with a suffocating defense (best in country) that really only seems to surrender points in the first 3 drives of a given game before completely clamping down, and Michigan State doesn't have enough firepower on offense to make this a close game (the loss of White really hurts as they used to have two true #1s with Felton Davis/Cody White and Darrell Stewart is still out, RB LJ Scott still isn't back, and the OL is still banged up). MSU's defense has largely been lights out against the run this year - as they are most year - with one of their specialities being an infamous safety double a-gap run blitz Narduzzi crafted awhile back. But the downside of having the extra emphasis on the run game is space is opened up for TEs/H-Backs that are either man-free or largely unaccounted for outside a soft zone, and few teams have utilized their collection of HBs and TEs as well in the passing game as Michigan has this year. We already saw Northwestern take advantage of this in their 29-19 win against Michigan State in how they utilized their split-back Cameron Green. Michigan State was also +4.1 on their turnover margin against Penn State and really won more so on Penn State's own blunders than Michigan State being a consistent threat offensively. Finally, even with this team's unpredictability, I don't see Michigan State being able to bring their Dantonio special back to back weeks - Last year Michigan State beat Penn State 27-24 in a close game and then lost 48-3 the next week @Ohio State, and similarly, last year the won @Michigan 14-10 before barely holding on @Minnesota in a 30-27 win. So I get while going against Michigan State/Dantonio is scary, but Michigan +7 is just great value.
* Fresno State -14 (@New Mexico): I take Fresno State almost every week, and probably will continue to take them every week until Vegas finally makes them the 20+ point favorite they should be against most of their conference opponents. Fresno State just plays lights out defense week in and week out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"	The line should be at least -10, and -7 is phenomenal value for Michigan here (ironically I got down-voted for saying this exact same thing last week against Wisconsin but it was obviously true then too). My write-up on this matchup is in my [picks post on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/9oei70/week_7_betting_discussion_thread/e7tu8jw), but Michigan's defense is probably the best in the country, Michigan State doesn't have the firepower to keep this a close enough game (especially with their injuries at WR/OL and LJ Scott still being out) and Michigan should be able to use their TEs/RBs in the passing game to exploit Michigan State's run blitzes similar to how how Northwestern used their split back Cameron Green against MSU.

101	"Me (25M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been dating for 3 years. Just before out 1 year anniversary we had a 3 month break and we got back together. The reason for getting back together was that I felt like that all the reason we broke up were resolved.

I feel like I’m at the end of the straw now though. Everything we talk about is to do with our friends getting married and how we have been dating for a while longer and still not engaged. Just to mention we decided not to have sex or move in together until we are married just out of a commitment to each other. I am dying too though, haha.

A month or two ago she said we need to start having serious relationship talks and I do agree. I’ve been actively looking at houses and wanting to take her to open homes (she always pulls out), but I go and I get into the mindset of looking for just me. I’ve started to be way more open about my financial position and what exactly I’m bringing to the relationship and potential marriage – this included what I’m earning and what I’m exactly saving each month. I’ve even had meetings with the banks to help get all unnecessary spending reduced, I thought I’m doing the right responsible thing. She was upset. Telling her my meetings with the banks about home loans and saving, but I hadn’t mentioned to the bank about saving up for an engagement ring. She didn’t think any of it matters until I actually proposed.

This leaves me with eh feeling like she wants to be engaged or married because of everyone else, her life plan or the sake of being married.

She’s also unwilling to share her financial position and talk openly about what bills she pays 'because that’s private'.

Yesterday we’d had another one of these conversations about how we had serious things to talk about. But I don’t honestly know what that is. To expand more she doesn’t feel like she’s taken care of, to which I don’t get. She assumes I’ll pick her up for everything and there were 2 things this week I didn’t because it was logistically silly. (She had to drive to my parents place, where I live, to have dinner for my birthday). I feel like I pay for everything, which I don’t mind doing, but when she makes a point about not being taken care of, it makes me upset. I’m trying to get things together enough to make out lives but I don’t know if this is going to work. 

Looking for advice, if I'm being ignorant please let me know.

TLDR: Girlfriend is looking for the next step I'm trying to get there and she seems no interested

Of course I want a deeper dive into a game before reviews, but the ""review in progress"" format they have went to for quite a few games has rubbed me the wrong way, where they constantly update the front page every time an entry is made, even if it's a minor update, just to draw page views.

So I don't read IGN much anymore so I have no personal experience with this.

But doesn't that make sense? Would you rather they just put their ""Review in progress"" on the front page once and then after it gets updated or finalized it doesn't go up again? It seems to be that would hide the info unnecessarily. What would you rather take up that front page slot instead?"	"To your character I meant. But I get your point.

IMO static typing isn't even for preventing run-time exceptions, but more for documenting the business logic in code and being able to navigate/refactor code easily. Tests do help with refactoring as well, but why choose one when you can have both.

Only a subset of maintainability issues come from a lack of static typing, so there's no wonder statically typed codebases still have issues."	"&gt; Func&lt;int, bool&gt; lambda = num =&gt; num &lt; 5;

Hit at least two conventions without any intention of monetizing anything. Shoot a lot of all sort of cosplayers (from those with so-so costumes to the best ones) and post it in your local cosplay FB groups and your social media accounts.  
Go to cosplay gatherings outside convention days once in a while and shoot for free (no need to bring your whole arsenal of flashes, just do simple shoots). The thing is most people cosplay for fun and there's a big sense of community so don't just come to them to sell stuff, do some things for free to help the community members.

But... I hope this doesn't seem too jerky...

When you say that ""it probably just happens that this man-made concept is objectively true"" you give away the core of the argument.  On naturalism it's just lucky that math applies, but on theism the reason is that the universe was designed to be fundamentally intelligible.  I don't think this is Craig's strongest argument.  I think an atheist can make a pretty good case that it's just impossible for any universe to exist where math doesn't apply.  I don't know what that argument is, it's not obvious to me, but I don't think this could be as strong long term as the cosmological argument you respond to in the second part of your post.

Hey, thanks for engaging with me and being polite.  I hope I was fine for you, and that this exchange was a positive experience."	"Does it make more sense though now? 

&gt;To be frank, mathematics is a man-made concept, therefore I don't find that argument interesting at all.

Yes, mathematics is man made.  (Craig deals with both possibilities, man made and independently existent, but when dealing with anti-realists he's assuming it's man made).  That makes it even weirder.  Why does it end up being so freaking useful in totally unexpected physics applications when it's this mental fiction people created?

&gt;This is a clear strawman that I can see in the middle of a wheat field.

120	Newtons laws is very accurate and easy to work with in most cases. However they get less and less accurate as the speeds involved gets larger and larger. So if you want your physics to be accurate at higher speeds you need to use Einsteins laws of general relativity instead of Newtons laws. This makes things much more complicated but more accurate. The threshold for when you switch away from classical physics and to relativistic physics depends on your application. However a good rule of thumb is around 10% the speed of light.	You may have misunderstood. It usually costs performance to have more dynamic elements. Whenever a pot hits something (which is quite often considering it sits on the ground) it have to check if the force is big enough to shatter it. And when it shatters it turns into multiple fragments that all need their own physics calculations. It does cost them some time to code this but that is not so much unless you want to make everything breakable. But in terms of performance it can cost quite a lot.	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1

It's important to note that we don't have a presidential system, so the PM governs by consent of their colleagues rather than a direct election for Prime Minister. All PMs have to keep their people happy, but with her tiny majority she has to worry about it more than a typical PM. And her colleagues know this.

Since firing him will create too much dissent and trouble among the other lapdogs, and it would only take a few dissenters to derail her majority in Parliament, she was forced to let him stay where he was.

Justine Greening said ""No"" to her demotion, and because she hasn't always publically agreed with the PM on everything, May stood to gain a bit more than she'd lose by firing her, and no one would blame her for it. So Greening and Hunt gave the same answer, and one stayed while the other one got the sack."	unitedkingdom	unitedkingdom	1

Kalam can be refuted with a very simple question: „Who created God?”.

If the answer is „Nobody, God always existed, uncaused!” then the same argument could be used for an universe which always existed, uncaused (for example, as a perpetual cycle of Big Bangs and Big Crushes)."	"&gt; atheism is the position of denying the existence of God.

My self esteem would get lower and lower and I would tolerate a lot of abuse that I shouldn't have just because I felt like I deserved it, that they weren't wrong about me, just being honest.

None of your attributes, height, eye colour, bodily functions are down to your 'wants' or free will. It's either to God's design, or random, unguided genetic mutations set in motion by ""the universe"". "	"""Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can't. If a thing is free to be good it's also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they've got to be free.
Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently, He thought it worth the risk. (...) If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will -that is, for making a real world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings- then we may take it it is worth paying."" - C.S.

I'm a bit confused because that isn't what I was referring to.  I'm saying that you are allowing yourself to get worked up over nothing.  It is you giving their ineptitude the power to affect how you feel.  I am also saying that the sooner you stop looking for reasons to feel slighted, the faster this issue will fade into oblivion for you.  

I understand that feeling slighted by these 'compliments' is a subconscious activity.  But if you train yourself to recognize when you are doing it, you can consciously break yourself of that.  It will get rid of a lot of unnecessary stress."	"There will always be degrees to which clumsiness becomes insulting.  The grey area in life always makes things more interesting.  To your point: the ""wow, you're so pretty for an Asian"" would probably lead to more people feeling insulted than your original story.  

I still have the same answer for you.  Because if you spend time looking to be insulted by things that were not intended to be an insult, you will definitely feel insulted by something.  Inner peace comes through understanding that most people don't want to insult you.  Many people are just a bit slow on their feet.  Some are downright dim.  It doesn't mean that they mean you ill.  If the intent was to compliment, accept it with grace and move on.  It doesn't mean you need to give them a second thought or waste any energy at all being upset.

It's left somewhat ambiguous what a ""cyber rapper"" even is, but from a couple of short clips in the anime where Densetsu is shown ""performing"" in front of other refugees, it seems like maybe other cyborgs can link to Densetsu's cyberbrain while he's rapping, and that somehow enhances or adds to the experience of the performance?

2 Thessalonians 1:9 ESV

They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,

&gt;God has all the omnipotence in the world  to give them a way to change. 

And God does while they are on Earth, once dead, people will change not out love but our of selfish reasons.

&gt;How can the maximal being make mistakes? 

Just like a parent who gives birth to a child with the ability to do bad and good. As a good parent you teach your children to do good, but when they choose not to, you are not responsible for it, because you taught then to do otherwise.


&gt;There is no reason why he cannot reform people, because that will defeat the entire point of his omnipotence. 

The best explanation i have is that, if people choose to deny God while alive - on Earth where they have complete freedom of will, dropping them into hell and then taking them out is inderecflt forcing those people to accept God after death. 

&gt;No, that's not what I'm talking about. God should give reformative punishments

But won't God's love exceed God's justice in this case? He gives eternal heaven for everyone, but only finite justice to the haters of God?

&gt;God is omnipotent, or at least the maximal being should be maximally powerful.

After their first encounter with the scouting party that attacked the orcs for destroying wisps, aka the ancestral spirits of their ancestors, the orcs should have reported back to Thrall about what they found. Instead of doing the sensible thing of deferring to their warchief, the orcs instead doubled down because they were more than glad to have an excuse to fight rather than logging."	You're conveniently neglecting the part where it was the ruling class of the night elves that made their dealings with the Legion and that it was the underclass that fought for many years to overthrow them and reestablish a society free from the forces the highborne used to nearly destroy the world.

189	"&gt; Too much body hair? Just don't shave it, lots of men don't, it's much more acceptable for men than for women.

I am a literal gorilla. Not shaving is actually not an option for me because it's *physically uncomfortable*. That's not even including the shame that even my *best* partners have (even unintendedly) caused by commenting on it and making it into a deal (which I can't even blame them for, because it's not like *I* enjoy giving oral while picking hair out of my teeth). 

&gt;Periods and childbirth aren't exactly the extent of inconvenience for women, there's also greater risk of sexual assault (and all the precautions you need to take as a result)...

I'm a two time sexual assault survivor. I recognize that, statistically, women are 3 times more likely to be assaulted than men, but I don't feel comfortable making comparisons on that front, which is why I didn't bring it up. 

&gt;fluctuating hormones, being more prone to UTIs, etc...

This is genuinely something that I don't have to deal with that I would start having to if I could wave a wand. Not really much to say there, you're right that guys don't really have to deal with that (although, as a person with chronic depression, I still don't have the easiest time with hormones). 

&gt;Seriously, it's not even close, the vast majority of people of any gender would tell you that being male is infinitely more ""convenient"".

To be fair, I didn't actually say that women's lives were ""more convenient"" in my post. I made it a point not to make that comparison, because I don't think I have that right. I just stated that being a man IS inconvenient in the ways I described. Would it be less so in those *specific* ways? Probably, but not in others. Which is why I didn't make the comparison. 

&gt;The SO's orgasms don't seem to hold a candle to mine, even though he seems completely satisfied. 

And, honestly, this is a big complaint of mine. It takes SO. MUCH. MORE. EFFORT. to give a man the quality of orgasm that women can get from even a cheap $20 bullet vibrator, to say nothing of what you can get from a really good partner. It's not a contest. Women get the better O because their bodies are physiologically different, and after a while, that starts to get frustrating, especially when it's INCREDIBLY rare to find a female partner who values being an exceptional partner. Because, women just need ""good"" male partners (or good female ones, if they're bi or lesbian). Men need *exceptional* female partners, though, because our sex organs lack a lot of the versatility that women's have and our brains require more varied stimulation (on the whole, not in all cases).

It had Medusa, the Minotaur, and Cerberus on the cover and it totally caught my eye and I had to have it. 	When I was in 4th grade pretty much all the boys in my class was reading Dragon Rider so I got it too. I was into dragons a lot. I also got a lot of the Ology books too as well as Ripleys Believe it or Not books.

I took a break from reading for fun when the original series ended with the Last Olympian. I then got back into reading by reading the sequel series. I've now been reading a lot of young adult books by looking at book series similar to Percy Jackson series and there was a lot of interesting results that have came up. At the same time, I've read some books by word of mouth and also books by same authors I have enjoyed. I heard about Atlas Shrugged which led to me also reading the Fountainhead. I heard about Snowcrash which got me to buy Cryptonomicon.

"&gt; yeah, when I use your calculator, saving $10-$30 per month gives you $18k to $55k at age 65 for 5% rate of return and 3% inflation. How did you get $850k? That's an insanely high number and makes no sense.

A: It's not my calculator. It's not my argument. 

B: The linked article tells you how the $850k number can be reached, and in that context it isn't an unreasonable number.

&gt; Your numbers assume a 7% rate of return if you put it all into index funds...which are a high risk. 

Not my assumptions, not my argument, not my risk assessment. But you've answered your own question about where the $850k number came from. So, you understand how compounding interest can turn ~$175/mo into about $1,000,000 over 45 years. I'm not sure why you're taking this position that you simultaneously understand the math, and also think that the result is somehow ridiculously incomprehensible.

If the above OP has NetFlix, that's $10/m, Hulu, $10/mo, Internet $75/mo, Cable television $100/mo, that's easily over $175/mo. Their assumption is that they're spending $42,500/decade, $4,250/yr, $350/mo on discretionary entertainment, so cutting $175/mo out of that shouldn't be difficult.

&gt; The stock market could crash at age 65 and it take 10 years to recover your value, by then you could be dead.

Bad luck happens. The 7%-8% return is the average. It takes good and bad years into account. This isn't a recommendation on how to manage your retirement portfolio, this is a simple exercise to describe how a small amount of savings can pay off over 45 years of working.

&gt; There are so many other ways you could save money, I would say cutting out someone's main source of entertainment for their entire life is just stupid.

I had just been considering trying for Eevee or something in Silver, and I had the theory behind it due to [this post from a year ago I saved](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/5k7z11/and_you_thought_christmas_with_your_family_was/dbm92a4/), but I hadn't thought of some tricks such as not even attempting to get a shiny from the bridge Pokemon.

Something to add, though, from that post I'm referring to:

&gt; Def was passed down normally, but Special had a 50% chance to be either the same as the parent, or the parent's +/- 8 (depending on the parent's IV, if the parent had a low Special, it would be boosted in the child, and weakened if the parent had a high special)

Which means that a Pokemon in the Shiny Family may have gotten the +/-8 Special instead, which halves the chances of further children being Shiny, and makes it so its children have a chance to not even be in the Shiny Family at all. So if, for example, you're going for Scyther, there's a large chance that if you don't breed any of the intermediate parents as Shiny, the Scyther may have a 0% chance of being Shiny. You'd have to check the DVs in a calculator.

200	So if I made sure to carefully keep track of all travel activity, I'd be okay? I was wondering if it would matter that I wasn't a contractor / self-employed. Would I file taxes normally and just claim the exemption? 	"Hi Oliver,

I haven't been able to get an explicit answer about this, so I figured I'd ask you directly. I've read a few of your posts and most of the questions aren't exactly my situation.

So here it is:

I am a non-married American citizen. I work (as a ""full-time"" / non-contractor in tech) in PA for a company based out of that state. I have the ability to work remotely indefinitely. I was wondering if I would be eligible for the FEIE if I were to leave the US and bounce around the world (think 3 months EU, a month in UK, month in Ireland, month in Croatia, repeat) while maintaining the same job. By the time I had in mind to do this, I would have no apartment or house (lease would be up), and I might have a storage unit to keep my things for an eventual return. I would spend over 330 days overseas (goal of 2-3 years) during that time.

If I were eligible, is there anything I'd need to do to prove it or to improve my eligibility? What kinds of forms would I have to fill out for my taxes? For the first tax exemption, would I want to leave as close to January 1st as possible (or before of course) so I could have a full fiscal year out of the country and have no issues with overlap?

Thank you so much! This thought / fantasy has been on my mind for quite some time. I'd love to get an answer to it."	IAmA	IAmA	1
201	**Every** macro system that lets you operate on the AST knows what are or aren't identifiers at the time of expansion; syntax-rules is no different.	"&gt; superiority of non-hygienic macros is obvious

Maybe - MAYBE - outside of scheme and descendants, including racket. Schemes claim to be ""fully lexically scoped."" This applies not only to variables and functions resolution but also to the language's keywords. You can shadow if, let, lambda, define; whatever you want. This is great for making custom or restricted languages, and since you can shadow anything it's important that macros defined in a certain context retain that when expanded, and that the expansion of the macro not interfere with its arguments.

However, even without the necessity of hygiene imposed by scheme's extreme lexical scoping rules, I think that hygiene is still a desirable property. Being able to write and use macros without caring about the implementation or the usage is really nice.

And the choice is not between syntax-rules (only hygienic) and defmacro (unhygienic). There are hygienic by default macro systems that allow breaking hygiene when desired. syntax-case + datum-&gt;syntax from r6rs, chicken scheme's renaming macro transformers, and MIT's syntactic-closure transformer."	programming	programming	1

214	"Bear in mind that we also heard similar warnings just before the Financial Crisis market meltdown in 2008.  That happened to be an economic bullet which the Fed and U.S. dodged.  The reason we've been hearing warnings since 2008 is that Congress and the Fed never fixed the systemic problems that culminated in that major economic threat.  Instead, they kicked long overdue economic and fiscal legislative reforms down the road and created an even bigger threat.  This ""negligence"" was caused by financial industry and special interest group lobbying efforts and outright bribery/extortion.

219	"&gt;You are clearly still struggling with the dilemma as you are going back and forth between greater good justification and divine command. I am sorry that in order to protect your closely held beliefs you have resorted to defending slavery, genocide, and religious discrimination.

Thank you. Your pity really means a lot to me. Unfortunately, it may be misplaced as there is no dilemma on my end with regards to greater good and divine command. You just seem unable to understand my position which, if I'm being charitable, is probably due to my inability to explain it clearly, but I'll continue to try nonetheless.

&gt;God could have brought eternal salvation to humanity without slavery and genocide. 

How do you know this?

&gt;Then why pick Hitler instead of a random person? I suspect because you wanted to soften the evil of divine command theory.

The Hitler example is relevant because if God told you in 1908 that you should kill a random, struggling artist, you would accuse God of being evil. 

&gt;Under divine command theory you can justify any evil act and it makes your reasoning no different then the 9/11 hijackers.

Correct. The ""*reasoning*"" is no different from the 9/11 hijackers. However, I don't believe that it was God's will that they fly those planes into the twin towers.

&gt;Again, this would mean that slavery, genocide, and child sacrifice are good. 

These things don't become good in the abstract. God abhors child sacrifice as the old testament clearly states but he'll specifically command it from Abraham because he wants to test him. If God commands a genocide, then it is good. If a dictator decides on his own apart from God that he wants to commit a genocide, then it is evil. God doesn't need to follow the rules that he gave us. If you think this is unjust, then go ahead, be my guest, and hold God accountable.

&gt;Which means there is a possible world where Hitler didn't kill millions of people. And God chose not to create that world.

No, the possible world where Hitler doesn't kill millions of people was Hitler's decision to make. Not God's.

&gt;And now you are defending anti-semitism.

What defense? I'm literally answering your question. You asked me ""do you feel it was easier or more difficult to convince his citizens to participate in the Holocaust after centuries of anti-Semitic rhetoric preached from the pulpits of the Catholic church?"" and I basically answered yes with the clarification that members of the church practiced anti-Judaism, which was religion based, not race-based like Nazi antisemitism, but regardless, it did make antisemitism easier in Nazi Germany.

**Look. I get it. You think I'm a close-minded asshole and your anger is making it difficult to understand my position. But could you at least try to treat this like a clinical, dispassionate examination of the psyche of a religious person. You're so ready to confirm your own preconceptions of me that you can't even read what I wrote carefully enough to see that I am agreeing with you.**

&gt;So God could have punished them for slavery but didn't.

Let me reemphasize that there is a difference between what God permits and what God actively wills. God may allow things that he doesn't want, to achieve an end. He permits divorce but he did not want it to be the end design goal. He permitted that Israel have a King even though it went against his will and he warned them that they would be worse off with a human king. God only knows to what end or purpose slavery could have served but he permitted it nonetheless. Idolatry, the worship of false gods, served no purpose in God's eyes and he must have seen it as very harmful to the Israelites which is why he punished them for it.

&gt;Yet he takes away Pharaoh's free will in Exodus by hardening his heart.

I don't believe that Pharaoh had his free will taken away. But if you want to tell me that my reading of scripture is wrong and you're right, knock yourself out.

&gt;I do not use that definition of omnipotence.

What is your definition? Because you asked me if God is omnipotent or not so based off your definition, I will answer that question.

&gt;Your description of God seems to be utterly useless a standard of moral behavior.

If you're saying that ""God's will"" is useless as a ""general standard"" of moral behavior, then yes I'd agree with you. God rarely makes his will in specific instances explicit and so relying on ""God's will,"" i.e. expecting and waiting for God to reveal to you what you should do in every moment of your life, is both useless and does not happen generally. This is why he gave the Israelites the Mosaic law, which they would use to govern themselves until the coming of Jesus, who instituted the New Covenant, which superseded and overwrote the Mosaic law.

&gt;Extradition does not equal eternal torture.

Are you being deliberately obtuse? Of course they're not equal. It's an analogy. "	"A few points from the Catholic perspective.

1. The material universe is like a dream and God is the dreamer. He didn't merely start the universe and then abandon it to its own devices: he is keeping it in existence perpetually and the universe needs God to exist.

2. Humans are a unique creature in the material universe. They have free will and their choices matter.

3. Think of the period from the start of the universe until the apocalypse as ""phase 1."" The point of phase 1 for us humans is for us to choose which side we're on: are we on God's side or not. The existence of evil in phase 1 makes it shitty but it isn't designed to last forever. You want God to make phase 1 better and get rid of evil and all that and you think that's his job, but a Catholic would say that you're thinking of it wrong. What your primary concern should be is if you're living a morally good life: ""and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.’  The second is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these."" *—Mark 12:30-31* There is more to it than these two commandments but it's the gist of what we humans should be concerned about with while we're alive here in this universe. So you do your part in living a morally good life and if everyone else did their's then the world would probably be a way better place, but ultimately, the world becoming a better place isn't what matters in the end: what matters in the end is if you chose to be on the right side when you die."

The office of the Federal Chancellor is basically the equivalent of a prime minister and does not have term limits, as is the case in almost any other parliamentary democracy.

The chancellor can be removed at any time with a simple majority vote in parliament, can’t veto laws or sign executive orders and isn’t the commander-in-chief of our armed forces.

If we're talking about the one God like in Abrahamic tradition, then it is possible to feel that he is just/unjust based on your subjective idea of morality. However if morality were absolute and stemmed from God himself, then your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant as God would obviously be just. You could accuse him, but your accusation would be based on your own opinion vs a ""divine truth"". 

Regarding your previous comment about a pantheon of Gods, I don't know if a polytheistic religion exists where every God is painted as infallible and all-good.

237	"I stand corrected! You're quite right that there seems to be misinformation regarding Nixon and Drug Policy. Thanks for enlightening me!

That said, I still stand by the original point that especially regarding drug legislation that there certainly seemed to be if not racial bias at the very least racial consequence:

Sentencing disparities

In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking or possession of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine,[71][72][73][74] which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.[75] This 100:1 ratio had been required under federal law since 1986.[76] Persons convicted in federal court of possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine received a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years in federal prison. On the other hand, possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine carries the same sentence.[72][73] In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act cut the sentencing disparity to 18:1.[75]

According to Human Rights Watch, crime statistics show that—in the United States in 1999—compared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.[77]

Statistics from 1998 show that there were wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.[72] Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races,[78] even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.[72]"	"I wouldn't say that I'm involved in activist anti-racist ""circles"". That was rather part of the point I was originally making. I would say the majority of my friends are against racism. (Ergo - anti-racist). I and a number of my friends would speak / act against racist actions and policies when presented a situation. (Therefore looking to help change others views regarding racist thoughts/actions, etc.) 

So while we don't hold rallies or go to meetings, I would say we're actively ant-racist and I think a fairly high percentage of Canadians would identify likewise. 

Again, it's a bit of a strawman that you're presenting here. 

As a final point I went over to /r/racism and asked about the above and so far as of yet have not been contradicted by anyone.

241	I struggled this issue many years ago. I decided the best way forward was to read thru the entire bible and jot down every verse/passage I thought might have something to do with Hell/Judgment day. When I got done I looked thru the passages I had written down in various translations to try and synthesize what the bible actually teaches about hell. I found that there is actually very sparse verses that talk about hell directly and most of them are controversial in how to properly translate them.  In the end I come down on the side of Annihilation. those who are cast into the lake of fire are destroyed both body and soul. 	The word faith has come to mean something you believe in. It is almost entirely a thing of the mind. Therefore it is no longer an adequate word in english to translate the greek.

* There have been hints that we might get some stuff on the pre-Conquest Targaryens who were the Lords of Dragonstone, which would be new.

* The Conquest and the reigns of Aenys and Maegor, we've got in their entirety, more or less. We may get some new stuff on Aegon's reign after the Conquest, but most of that would likely incorporate the ""Dorne Against the Dragons"" material from the World Book.

* Martin has said the one section he needed to flesh out was the reign of Jaehaerys I, so I'd expect some new stuff there, although it's hard to say how much. Jaehaerys reigned for 55 years but the majority of it was peaceful.

* We've seen most of the material on the reign of Viserys I and the run-up to the Dance. *The Rogue Prince* is roughly 13k words and Elio has said that the text it's drawn from (*The Heirs of the Dragon*) is 17k words. So we'll get a little extra, but not much. 

* We're getting a lot more of the Dance, almost double. *The Princess and the Queen* was 30k-35k words, but apparently Martin wrote roughly 60k about the whole war. 

* The biggest new section we're getting is the Regency of Aegon III, which is apparently also about 60k words, but hasn't been seen in any form beyond the Aegon III chapter in the World Book, which is only a few thousand words.

If for some reason the ""boxier"" cuts have narrower shoulders at the 17"" collar size, then the tailoring the shirts seems like a good option. Is the standard procedure there to pay ~$20 per shirt and have them darted?

On the Pants:

Yes, they pull a little bit on the crotch and there is a very slight flare on the pockets. The more relaxed fit, the ""hudson,"" seemed like it had too much material and that the legs were too wide. Would going up 2"" in the waist size and staying with the slimmer Clark fit be a good idea?

I think its about 99 percent certain at this point that Eren ate his dad. As far as why his dad passed it on to Eren, I’m assuming he knew this attack by the other shifters was coming. Maybe he wanted to hide the power away in Eren, or maybe Eren being younger, and eventually fitter, gives him a more powerful Titan form and gives the people in the walls a better chance? Also, and sorry to go off on a tangent, I take it we can confirm that Titans were created by a serum invented by humans. And humans probably created Titan shifting powers too? Ymir was probably injected with this serum, and maybe injury is the trigger to transforming into a regular Titan just like Titan shifters, that’s why they pushed her off their own respective wall and it caused her to transform.

2. I don’t know if the plan is to give Historia Eren’s Titan power, but almost certainly the plan is to give it to someone else, maybe the fraud king? Or Kenny will try to take it? After all, he did ominously tell Levi he’s done everything to pursue his “dream”. Honestly I’m just annoyed Eren is kidnapped again, seems to be the theme of every season.

3. I think his fragmented memory of his father injecting him has something to do with memory loss when he became a Titan, like how Ymir doesn’t remember eating Reiner and Bertolt’s friend. As far as Erens dream at the beginning of the show, yeah wouldn’t surprise me if this memory manipulation has something to do with that. Grisha hadn’t injected him yet, so I’m assuming it can’t have anything to do with Eren’s own powers."	ShingekiNoKyojin	ShingekiNoKyojin	1

""Early intervention is best, so as employees reach a yellow zone for burnout, that’s the time to make referrals or maybe turn down the pressure put on them and the pressure they self-generate.""

&gt;Offer a flexible working environment: for instance, allow employees to choose their own hours, work from home when needed, and take time off regularly. ""Ensure that people have time off, respites from work, and emotional support on the job,"" says Quick. ""Burnout results from working or striving for too long and/or with too much effort and energy expenditure.""

&gt;Encourage non-work activities. ""Burnout is best prevented when people have things that excite them, energize them, and bring them renewals…whatever that is."" explains Quick.

Other sources put the number closer to 93%. That means that the true number of guns in this country is probably at least 500 million, if not *much* higher. 33,000 accidental shootings per year sounds like a lot, but that's only .0066% of all American guns being used in an accidental shooting. Even combined with the approximately 13,000 deliberate gun homicides committed each year, that's still only .0092%.

I know that once you see the effects of something like polio (which wasn't unusual to see in the mountains where I grew up) you can get a bit stubborn about the risk involved in not vaccinating for that kind of thing. 

Eliminating polio and smallpox was a major effort. They're no longer in the list of things we have to worry about for the most part. Except in places where vaccines never wiped out the pool of it in the population.

Anybody that's dealt with a nasty bug asking sweeping through an isolated population also gets rather upset at idiots that don't even understand what vaccines are, how they're made, or even how they work in the body screwing up herd immunity for the rest of the world.

Now, I get it. Things like the flu that mutate rapidly and rely on predicting which strains to attack are a bit less important than things like , I dunno, measles that could be potentially eradicated.   But if you've never seen the flu run through a nursing home killing patients, you might never think about the possibility of it being something to worry about. 

If you've never seen that kind of thing, or studied it, there's no way to have the perspective to evaluate the risks and rewards of the subject of vaccination.

And without at least a little bit of training, self education is difficult. You can't trust regular media outlets for education, and actually reading the original studies is hard enough if you do have the training to understand them. And that's assuming you know how and where to find them.

Of course, that's why most people find someone that *can* do those tasks. Like maybe a close relative that's got a degree in a relevant field like, I dunno, biology or microbiology, and pay attention to them.

But hey, I'm going to stop digging at you.

If your sister did try to educate you on the subject, for a month, and your reaction was that her education as ""just"" her saying she knows more than you, have you considered that you throwing the typical arguments against vaccination at someone with the training to actually understand the original studies and experiments might be a wee bit insulting to her?

Think about that.  She's doing her best to give you information that's as up to date and accurate as possible. She's spent years studying *exactly* what you're talking about.  And the arguments you use are not even actual evidence, no real data gathered, just parroting whatever layman's source you've decided to use.

That month she spent doing her best was also a month she spent getting told by her sister that she was an idiot, being insulted over and over again. 

And since you phrased it as ""the reason she knew more than me"" is a darn good indicator of how you were looking at the situation. There's this thing that people do when confronted with something that goes against what they believe. They tend to decide that their belief is correct, and that anyone  that is using logic and facts to say otherwise is speaking down to them, or trying to be better than them. It prevents the person from actually considering that they might be wrong.

In turn, those people tend to become more defensive, more angry and often even directly insulting rather than just passively so.

Maybe your sister didn't cut you off because you didn't vaccinate your kids. Maybe she did it because  you ceased to be a thinking person, a loving sister that values the sibling in front of you, and acted like she was questioning your religion. You probably got more and more irate that she would dare try to say anything about your decision for your kids *instead of maybe listening to someone that loves you trying to also protect them from harm*.

Yeah, I'd have sent the same letter she did probably. Actually, I'm a jerk, so I would have spelled out exactly what I thought of someone that utterly insulted me and everything I'd worked towards. And I'd have probably called you names at that. I'm a jerk. Once I've figured out that someone is a backwards, non thinking fool, I give up on being polite and take the opportunity to let loose my inner butthole.

Did she do any of that? Throw insults unrelated to the specific subject?  Tell you you were a hopeless troglodyte? Spew hatred and venom? If she did, you're better off with her gone.

If she didn't, then maybe it's you that screwed up.

In your post you asked what you could do to fix the situation.

At this point, I doubt you'll welcome any advice from me simply because I've  been condescending and harsh. But I'll give it just in case.

If you want to patch things up. Send her copies of this exchange. Print it out, forward it through email, whatever. Tell her this a-hole on the internet  just spent way more time than is healthy throwing barbs at you for not vaccinating and being a jerk to her.

Then ask her if I'm right about the way you made her feel.  Tell her that if that is true, you're sorry. Tell her that you love her and want to try and move past it. 

If she is, *then* you explain how you felt. Then you either ask that this single subject be off limits, or you ask her to explain the science behind her arguments again. And if she agrees to do so, you listen. Remember that she isn't some faceless drone, she's your sister and isn't trying to belittle you.

I'd bet that at some point in all that, she'll tell you she missed you and loves you. She may even apologize for any of the hurtful things she said or did (I would hope so, just because she was right doesn't mean she had to be a jerk about it).

Otherwise, just leave it as it is. If you can't face having been wrong, you can't expect her to either."	"Look, her reaction was certainly over the top considering she didn't even try to correct your ignorance.

And I think she could have and should have kept in contact by phone or other non physical methods. But nobody with any sense would be hanging around your household either.

I've got a ton of back woods, uneducated, dumb, and backwards relatives. I tend to avoid being much to do with them negate it just isn't going to end well. My cousin is always going to run his mouth  about how n*****s are ruining everything. My one uncle is going to get drunk and babble whatever tripe he gets off of fox ""news"". I've even got a cousin that thinks homeopathy has any scientific validity at all, and even claims it works better than antibiotics.

After a certain point, you get really tired of having to choose to either ignore the constant stupidity, have yet another argument where nobody bothers to even look things up in an encyclopedia (much less a useful and up to date body of information), or just let every meeting devolve into getting drunk enough you don't care.

Now, I've had to cut ties because of pure, unadulterated bigotry and stupidity with some of my kin. But it wasn't until they showed stubborn, willful ignorance multiple times. If they had the sense to keep their brainless crap to themselves,  I wouldn't have felt the need to try and educate them beyond their upbringing. If they had even afford to just avoid general topics like politics, science, medicine, religion or race I could have enjoyed their company well enough to get by.

Heck, I won't even hold it against them since they grew up with no hope of using their brain for more than keeping their ears apart. They got fed idiocy from the crib, into school and until they dropped out. I can understand them not being able to think instead of just swallowing whatever they got fed. But I'm sure not wasting my time with them.

The thing about people that believe in factually incorrect things like racism, bigotry, or anti vaccination is that they can't *not* talk about it. It always comes up, over, and over again. But you really need to give family a chance. 

So, hey, at least you don't have a sister trying to educate you properly every time you're around her, and she isn't swamped by needing to do so.

 If she's so disconnected and uncaring that she can't bother to even try to find a way to get along before cutting ties, maybe you're better off anyway. If it hadn't been vaccination that set her off, it would have been something else. The kind of person who cuts ties without attempting compromise of some kind isn't that fun to be around.

I'm sorry she was so unpleasant and cruel about it all, but sometimes it's better if you find out that a relative doesn't care enough to try early so it's over quick"	relationships	relationships	1

That conclusion isn't entirely wrong- I have a co-worker who jokingly maintains a checklist of all the ways in which I fulfill the stereotype.

311	"Many people that vote Labour/Tories prefer it for exactly that reason, their team gets to win all the time.

I think it's weird as fuck but that's just me."	"&gt; FPTP is fucking shit, I'll never understand anyone that sticks up for it.

Pretty simple, it has strong support within Labour and the Tories because it essentially guarantees that it's one of them that is in government.

If we had a system like STV for voting then that would guarantee the end of the stranglehold that both parties have over politics in the UK.

With FPTP people feel forced in most seats to vote for either Tories or Labour in England, because essentially all other votes are wasted and end up making it worse if anything for the side they'd prefer to win (lending a vote to the Greens for example would harm Labour by losing them a vote and possibly allow Tories to have the largest vote share even though the Green voter would most likely much prefer a Labour win over a Tory win).

When you can vote for the party that you prefer then it often looks different, looking at Scotland is a perfect example where the SNP were given an opportunity through the Scottish Parliamentary elections and proved themselves in government enough to completely supplant Labour at every level of politics, Scottish Greens also get a decent amount of support in Scottish Parliamentary elections which doesn't translate over to UK Parliamentary elections due to FPTP."	unitedkingdom	unitedkingdom	1

314	"Wow. This is such a problematic and classist approach. I’m honestly shocked. 

That’s your unfortunate truth? So that’s the truth for all low income renters? How is that not insidious discrimination?"	"They try it, but most of what we see after those mixed income houses are promised is that the income for affordable in their building can still be restricted by a minimum income. So they create a certain number of “affordable” units but they sit empty while the “regular” units are rented out at whatever price. 

Then as that areas average income goes up, they can get a college kid in the room or a tenant they know can’t afford it so they leave the room relatively quickly. And then the “affordable” housing price doesn’t apply anymore. 

At least this is what is happening in Brooklyn and what I understand from the housing regulation crap I’ve been studying, so feel free to correct me "	news	news	1
315	"I was unable to find a good, clear picture of a regular cooler inside a case. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/wfTYSnn.jpg) is a current AMD cooler mounted on a standard 12"" x 9.6"" motherboard.  The Cooler is the metal heat sink with the AMD labelled fan mounted on it.  Heat is transferred to the metal (usually aluminum) and the fan pushes air over the surface to dissipate that heat (there are a lot of ways to maximize that surface area exposed to the air depending in how high tech the cooler is).

You could choose to use your current 680 in a new system but the gpu will make the most difference in gaming performance, cpu improvement has been relatively slow for the last 7 years.  2017 made some big steps forward in that area but games are just starting to utilize the extra power. An AMD system will require a gpu to be useable at all (they don't have any integrated video capability on the current cpus).  There is no predicting when gpu prices will come back down, we are just seeing the second wave of cryptocurrency starting.

B360 and H370 are upcoming motherboard chipsets for the 8xxx Intel cpus.  They will not allow overclocking and will have a few less features but will cost less.  If you get a non-k Intel chip (k at the end of the model means it is overclockable) they will be a good choice to reduce build cost.

If I had your system and wanted more gaming performance now I would go to /r/hardwareswap and post looking for a GTX 970 for $175.  You will probably get a couple of responses and they are very good for 1080p 60fps gaming (nearly all ultra settings).  If you used it for a year you would almost certainly be able to resell it and get at least half your money back.  Add a 250GB 2.5"" ssd as a boot drive and see if that satisfies your expectations, you can easily transfer it to a new build so there is no real down side."

317	My nurse navigator has been a godsend for things like counseling, support groups and even books that help. Also, have you checked with your local chapter of the American Cancer Society? They were able to meet with me (free of charge) and got me set up with a list of local support groups, psychologists and even a free wig :) It's worth looking into.	"Your situation sounds similar to mine but the roles are reversed. I'm a 43 yr old only child cancer patient to a single parent. It has been a whirlwind of emotions and at the beginning, like your Mom, I was having issues with anger and frustration.

Did that immediately make things better? No, but it made me take a step back and try to find a better way of dealing with emotions I had no clue how to deal with. Counseling does help...if you're a counseling type of person (I'm not) so, I've found better help with support groups. I have social anxiety, so I've used a lot of online support groups and it's helped so much.

344	"Here's a long-winded answer you weren't asking for!

In most Jurisdictions, they ask you if you believe in a supreme being. You need to be able to say yes, but there's not a requirement for what that looks like to you. That's why my Lodge has Jews, Christians, deists, and a smattering of anything else you could think up. 

Now, on its face - it can sound like a shitty thing to have as a requirement. But, then we need to talk about the aims of ""Mainline American"" Freemasonry. It's a part of Masonry we're bad at talking about with non-Masons. Keep in mind - I'm not judging you for not having a faith. You do you.

After a lot of thought on this, I think to let an Athiest join would be bad for the Athiest. Freemasonry isn't a religion (Far from it) - but out rituals do an excellent job of making you think about your faith. Not in a ""You should think of your faith like this"" way, but it helps you develop a set of tools to explore your particular relationship to deity. 

Sounds weird? Kinda, but you'd need to have gone through the ritual for it not to. And in many ways, that's the point. 

By letting an Athiest join, I feel like we would be handing them a set of tools and then asking them to build something they don't need or want for that matter. Atheists don't need to think about a relationship to a deity because they don't have one. So really, we'd be setting that person up for failure. 

What I'm talking about is just one part of being a Mason, but it's still a part of it. Without it, you're left with a social club."

346	"Yeaaa... no.  Before I really start, I will mention the intro below  the title, it is a bit on the factually correct and humorous side:

""Anglo-Saxon capitalism's drive to maximize profits in the short term won't save the planet.  Perhaps the Chinese model can?

But the answer to the question in it is no.

In the following quote we can see a false assertion:

 ""Decarbonisation of the economy requires alternatives for coal and cars  that run on diesel, and that plays to capitalism’s strengths.  Innovation is what capitalism is all about, and there has been  staggeringly rapid progress in developing clean alternatives to coal,  oil and gas.""

As the author already stated, maximizing the amount of trade widgets is what Capitalism is about.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"", an old saying many are probably familiar with.

 That would be more along the lines of why there has been rapid progress  in developing clean alternatives.  We find our survival to be a  necessity, so it is helping to motivate us to develop these other  technologies.

These technologies have been around for quite a  while now, such as hydroelectric and wind power and we could have been  developing them all along, but corruption and the drive for profits by a  greedy subgroup have held them back.

""Great advances are also  being made in battery technology, which is vital for the new generation  of electricity-powered vehicles.""

Sure, it may be ""important""  now, but what really held back development in the past?  Could it have  been the profit making technique of Planned Obsolescence?  Could be...

 ""And, more than anything, it means accepting that the world needs to  wage war against climate change. Powerful vested interests will say  there is plenty of time to act, and they are aided by climate-change  deniers who say there is nothing to worry about. These people need to be  called out. They are not deniers, they are climate-change appeasers.  And they are just as dangerously misguided as fascism’s appeasers in the  1930s.""

Here I can agree with the author to an extent.  He does  need to be called out as a Capitalism and Consumerism denier / appeaser."	"Carbon Taxes are a joke.  They do not lower the amount of Carbon released, it just moves some shells around as to who is releasing the carbon.  Where the carbon is actually and physically released from doesn't change nor does the amount.

Once government got their hands on the money, it was all corruption and downhill from there.

It’s just like trumps tax cut. Of course the economy will blossom and GDP will go to 4% and employment will go down. But I also know it’s not sustainable.

359	"Personally I do think that the left has to be organized for authentic fascism to arise and sustain itself. It's just anti-communism is a fundamental aspect of the American civic religion, and as a result endless red-baiting and scaremongering has become an integral part of our particular politics. So, perhaps somewhat uniquely, America can have the bogeyman of revolution existing in spite of literally all aspects of reality showing that the American left is not only completely impotent but also constantly consumed with eating itself to a truly comical extent.

To clarify, I think an organized left is required in order for a fascist movement to even *arise*, not necessarily to sustain itself in power. There have been fascist movements that have come to power against an organized left that have soon degenerated into a more traditional reactionary authoritarianism - Franco's Spain comes to mind. And there have been fascist movements that arose against an organized left but never came to power - such as the Brazilian Integralists. But I don't think there's ever really been a fascism that arose without an organized left, simply because labor parties and a robust labor movement have always been a mainstay all over the world outside of the United States; I guess American exceptionalism strikes again."	"I've addressed this in another post in this thread just now, but the gist is that since the organized left is practically non-existent in the United States, the ruling classes can afford the luxury of enacting their agenda through traditional means while letting Trump indulge in his rhetoric and his rallies. So long as the opposition lacks coherence and the will to take real action rather than impotently stage one or two large-scale marches a year, the ruling class is under no pressure to suppress them violently anytime soon. Of course, the extreme base they've delivered into Trump's hands has other ideas and delusions and frequently acts out without their control - hence the string of terrorist attacks in the past week and general escalation in right-wing violence since Trump was elected.

And further, fascism is not simply ""big government"" that suppresses dissent by force. If that was the case, it would be indistinguishable from other traditional authoritarian regimes. Fascism is much more complex and nuanced that a simple military junta. Now that I'm home and have access to my books and my desktop again, I'll simply take the concluding definition from Paxton's *Anatomy of Fascism* here:

&gt; Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

I'll also include his list of ""mobilizing passions"" to give you a better idea of what fascist ideology is concerned with:

&gt; * A sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions
&gt; * The primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior to every right, whether individual or universal, and the subordination of the individual to it
&gt; * The belief that one's group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies, both internal and external
&gt; * Dread of the group's decline under the corrosive effects of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences
&gt; * The need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary
&gt; * The need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group's historical destiny
&gt; * The superiority of the leader's instincts over abstract and universal reason
&gt; * The beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group's success
&gt; * The right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint from any kind of human or divine law, right being decided by the sole criterion of the group's prowess within Darwinian struggle

Umberto Eco's *Ur-Fascism* essay is also an invaluable tool in learning about fascist ideology."	worldnews	worldnews	1

$200 salary.

We can potentially keep up to three players. I'll explain:

1)Franchise - You keep this player for an average dollar amount determined by the prices of the top 6 players at that position the year before. If you spent higher than the average, you are stuck with that price. Example: Franchise tag price for RBs is $50 this season, but if you bought Bell for $62 last year, you pay $62 again. You can keep them for as many seasons as you'd like as long as you don't drop them during the season (injured, drop, pick back up for cheap at the end of the year) and you're willing to pay the price.

This year, QB franchise is $15, RB franchise is $50, WR franchise is $44 and TE franchise is $17 

2) Golden Ticket - You can keep this player for the price you paid for them in the previous season, but you CAN NOT keep them next year with a franchise or transition tag. They must be re-enter the auction pool next season.  

3) Transition - Basically a RFA. Bidding starts among other owners at the price you paid last year and when the bidding ends you have the option to match the bid and retain the player or let them go to this highest bidder.

I really only have two players worth keeping, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Last season I paid $22 bucks for Kareem Hunt and $17 for Keenan Allen. So, do I franchise Hunt for $50 and Golden Ticket Allen for $17 to get an RB1/WR1 combo for $67? Do I ticket Hunt for $22 and transition Allen? Do I ticket Allen and let Hunt go for fears of a sophomore slump?

And if it was MY PITBULL doing THAT or even defending himself against that boxer, I guarantee all the happy hour - soccer moms, chillaxing, drinking wine at the dog park would be calling 911 ASAP.	"Totally. My GSD's teeth are double the size of my pitbull. He's the real alpha in our house. But he is more selectively mellow and restrained; asserting himself on occasion to remind my spoiled and sometimes adorably annoying pitbull re who is actually running things... Big dogs are big responsibility. It's weird as a life long big dog owner, but most people just can't handle big dogs, probably never had them, and don't ""get it/them."" You have to keep big dogs in control- there's a lot at stake. Lots of love and skilled training."	news	news	1
377	Yes, absolutely! Theoretical biology can tell us a lot of things about what to expect when you increase intelligence or communication in a system. And of course we can look at least at what seems to work with sociality, communication, sensing, and action, though we are never entirely sure what *didn't* work with animals that no longer exist.  In my research group at Bath we write a lot of papers using evolutionary theory to understand things like [how trust interacts with increased information.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13235-017-0230-x) I'm working on another paper right now in political economics trying to use biological theory to understand why political polarisation / identity politics tend to get more severe when there is greater wealth inequality. 	"Actually, there already is such a panel called the [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/).  I do talk to those guys sometimes (some of them; so far not all at the same time.)  I'm most worried right now about:

* democracy

* disinformation (the better, original name for ""fake news"")

* overly high inequality and the instability it leads to.

* sustainability, which I suspect is part of the reason inequality increases instability (resource constraint)

I mostly talk to big tech about those last two when I get a choice, but of course I'll talk to them about anything they are interested in."	science	science	1
378	"&gt; For instance we can't really consume plankton

Sure we can. It's just that most of us generally don't.

The Aztecs ate spirulina, and the Japanese eat krill (okiami)."	"So I don't know about diamond semiconductors, but I can explain the silicone realm.

Wafers are cylindrical. dies, (the individual units that are turned into ICs) must be rectangular due to properties related to how the wafer is cut apart. The curved bit on the outside ends up getting wasted. The larger the wafer, the greater the efficiency of space gets utilized, and not wasted. There a whole computationally Hard problem of determining how to orient dies of various sizes as appropriate to be the most efficient.

Silicone wafers are currently most commonly 300mm. There was a push to go up to 450mm, but it's uncertain if that will happen because the ingots get a bit unwieldy at that size. I believe the first wafers were 25mm, and since at the time the photolithography was making much larger dies, they couldn't get more than a couple fairly simple ICs out of each wafer. 

So I guess that it's not until 4'' (100mm) that the numbers would start to crunch. "	IAmA	IAmA	1
379	That logic lacks alot on many levels. You should have a home inspection  before you purchase, so you would know about the crack, you should have flood insurance if there is a remote chance it could flood. home prices are on the rise(most everywhere) so the only way the value goes down is if you don't know how to maintain a house and you trash it (not the only way, but that's the biggest)	"Buying a home isn't a trap, it's about one of the best financial decisions you can make. When you pay rent, that money never comes back and you gain nothing  except one more month of housing, when you buy a home your money goes twords something you own, and in turn the value of the home rises,making you money. you also have the ability to increase  the value of the property  by investing  time and labor into the property, gaining  you equity

387	Well his authority is implicit. He is, after all, the Supreme being. This might be a hard pill to swallow but I have found that living my life according to God's principles is the best way to live. I wouldn't change for anything in the world. So he created us, it follows that he knows what's the best for us, and he wants what's best for us. Once we understand this and prove it to ourselves, obeying God becomes much much easier (1 John 5:3)	"This is actually extremely simple. God created everything, hence he is the absolute authority. He determines what is right and what is wrong. He gives you the freedom to choose, but he does not exempt you from the consequences of your choises. So he says what's good and what's bad.

So in a way you are right, seeing God as an individual, a person, which is how the Bible describes him, them there is no absolutely objective moral, we follow then God's subjective moral, which is fine in my book "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1
388	Problem is E-mount is far from ideal for full-frame sensors. It's 6-8mm smaller diameter than the new Canon and Nikon mounts.	"This interchange is starting to smell a bit of Canon-White-Knighting. But in case you really don't know, here is a list of existing APS-C lenses that have larger aperture than any Canon APS-C lens of similar focal length: Sigma 30mm f1.4 EX DC HSM, Sigma 30mm f/1.4 DC HSM Art, Sigma 30mm f1.4 DC DN, Sigma 16mm f1.4, Samyang 12mm f2, Samyang 16mm f2, Tokina 11-16mm f2.8, Tokina 11-16mm f2.8 II, Tokina 11-20mm f2.8, Tokina 14-20mm f2, Tokina 12-28mm f4, Sigma 10-20mm f3.5, Sigma 50-100mm f1.8, Sigma 18-35mm, Samyang 10mm f2.8, Mitakon Speedmaster 35mm f0.95, Mitakon Speedmaster 25mm f0.95, Nikon 35mm f1.8.

There are probably others, these are just the ones I either remembered or found with a quick search. Point is there are plenty of people that don't need the increased solution of the larger and more expensive sensors, and just want larger aperture and higher quality focusing motors. But Canon purposefully makes these things exclusive to their full frame line of lenses to force people to buy the more expensive solution. The fact that Nikon and Sony do the same thing doesn't make it less annoying."	photography	photography	1

* Squats: 215 lbs
* Deadlift: 205 lbs
* Bench press: 150 lbs
* Barbell rows: 120 lbs
* Overhead press: 85 lbs

They just chose to keep the one given, since there was no reason not to (since the courts already rejected their BS map)	Yes and they did interpret the Constitution and said the gerrymandered districts were illegal and then told the legislature to fix them, which they could have done.

"&gt; Well you see, the judiciary gave itself judicial review

If you look at Marbury v.

It was through inaction, not action, that resulted in what the judiciary could perform.

That somehow several judges have taken Marbury v. Madison and turned it into active responses and presumed the judicial review when it never was there in the first place is where the problem comes.  One federal judge even went so far as to impose a tax (which was later overturned.... but that it happened at all should be concerning).

422	Hinata adds nothing to Naruto's arsenal since he has sage mode and all that stuff. Sakura could potentially be a big help in the battle if she knows her role as support and heals Sasuke + supplies him Chakra. And Sasuke isn't a dick and protects her with his susano. 	"Left team IMO. Everyone on this thread forgot that Ino can literally talk to her teammates telepathically so she can be useful without mind transfer. She's also a sensory type ninja. Hinata has the byagukan and can easily pinpoint where Konan is if she does her paper tricks. Sakura has Katsuyu that counters Konan + negates most damage team 1 would even take. TenTen could spam her kunai to put Konan into good positioning for their team. 

All Ino has to do is transfer Hinata's thoughts of where Konan is to Sakura/Katsuyu and they could possibly take her down pretty easily.

Temari could be a threat, but Sakura probably has the speed/durability to close the distance and take her out. If she'd rather not risk it, she could probably transfer Chakra to Hinata for her to create a huge Air Palm and knock her out.

Karin and other girl are non factors imo. "	Naruto	Naruto	1
423	"&gt;Arguing that illegal immigration is akin to trespassing on private property is assuming all of the United States is your private property, which evidently isn't true. What if your legal immigrant neighbor wants to bring his family to live in his privately owned house? What part of the NAP is violated then? It certainly isn't trespassing unless you think you have more right to your neighbor's home than he does.

You started out with ""illegal"" then ended up arguing with ""legal"". I never said that the entire US is MY property. I argue that a nation has territory. If you're arguing for abolishing all nation-state borders in the world, just say it.

The few basic functions of a government are to define and defend property rights, defend against foreign aggression, protect its citizens against each other, and adjudicate disputes, within its border. If it isn't allowed to assume a border, the necessary qualifier for all those functions would vanish.

&gt;As long as the immigrants privately pay for their housing and support, then I don't really have a problem with it.

Neither do I have a problem with it. But how would you achieve this ideal? It's easy to just state an ideal. What exactly are the practical ways you have to move toward the best approximation that minimizes coercion on the citizens in the meantime? Also note that there necessarily is an order of operation.

I support your ideal. But I have to disagree with your approximation.

Again, according to the Bible, Jesus showed Himself to His followers following His resurrection. This is the main point. They would not willingly suffer horribly and die if they didn't see Him.

&gt;Because he doesn't know it is a lie. Educated people are not immune to believing lies. Stop ignoring my argument.

Again, these educated men saw Christ before them after His death on the cross. This goes again to this point: why would a man suffer and die for something he knows as a lie?

The apostles were eyewitnesses to the resurrection of Christ. They saw Him risen. They knew and understood the truth, and suffered and died proclaiming it.

They were also educated in terms of that time period.

A great example of what was awesome in the UK was giving birth.

Our first kid was born at the JR Radcliffe hospital, and they organized us in to a ""new parents"" group about 5 months before the due date. It was a great experience and we met every 2 weeks for some education about what to expect, and where people could discuss their concerns.

The actual birth itself took a long time (like 19h, my poor wife) and we had two nurses with us all the time keeping us company. Everything we needed was taken care of.

Then after the birth there were 5 follow up visits to our home where they came to make sure everything was ok. Those were really nice, as my wife was exhausted and going to the hospital would have been a pain. The follow ups confirmed that everything was OK with her milk etc.

The other case that comes to mind is that my father and grandfather both had strokes in their early 50s. Hearing this, I got a full genetic screen done on myself to spot any plausible issues and got a really thorough report on their opinion of my possible issues. The proactiveness was impressive.

Total costs of all of this being 0 GBP was nice.

430	"One of the things I find fascinating about evolutionary psych is that many of the mechanisms that are shaped by evolution to do specific tasks can be *borrowed* for use in evolutionarily novel ways. It's part of what makes people so *flexible* as a species. 

My guess is that there is strong evidence that the effects observed in this study are due to pheromones working directly on an evolved mechanism. However, the brain can *learn* to use that same evolved mechanism in response to an evolutionarily novel stimulus. In this case, the brain would learn to trigger the same ""warm-and-fuzzies"" response when it detected the cologne as the normal scent of the partner without cologne. If cologne did trigger the same response, my prediction would be that the response is [a] always less intense than the response to a smell that included pheromones, [b] that the effect would only be observed in women who were dating a man who wore *the same cologne all the time* (meaning it wouldn't be seen if the man didn't wear cologne very often or if the man changed his cologne often), and [c] that the woman only ever smelled her partner's cologne when it was coming from her partner (meaning that no other men the woman interacts with also wear that same cologne). 

tl;dr - It is possible that cologne could have the same effect, but it should be weaker and you should only see the effect if the dude was diligent about always wearing the same cologne that nobody else wore."

455	"I get the sense there is a LOT more going on under the surface here. It may or may not be relevant. (That's not an ask for more info; just recognition that, well, there's probably more going on here.) 

Based on the info provided, in this particular interaction, no, you are not the asshole for asking the person who disrespected you to leave your home. 

But, it probably wasn't necessarily smart either. That is your husband's mother and your daughter's grandmother. If she's truly as narcissistic and boundary-stomping as you've made her out to be, I can respect, and agree with, you laying down some rules. But from the sound of things, it doesn't seem like you've come up with a plan, nor communicated that plan to either her or your husband. Instead, you decided as you went along and let anger get the better of you (I know how easy that is in the heat of the moment, but it's also the kind of thing manipulators live for because it means they get to play the victim because you were yelling and so mean!) 

Sit your husband down and come up with your plan. Make sure he is on the same page about his mother's interference (all the planning on the world won't mean diddly if he doesn't see a problem with what she's doing.) You may have to compromise a little and adjust your plan if he isn't (ie, if you don't want her anywhere near your daughter, you might have to settle for supervised visits. If you don't want her in your home, you might have to agree that she can come over when you are already scheduled to be out of the house, otherwise he can visit her at her house.) Once you've agreed on your plan, sit down with your mother in law and communicate it to her. I probably wouldn't include reasons why and stick to something like ""these are the rules if you want to be in our lives, you can agree and see us and your granddaughter, or disagree and not see any of us."" (That's how I would do it, but the folks at /r/justnomil probably have additional/better pointers.) I would definitely have any conversation in a place that you and hubby can easily and quickly leave if she gets any attitude (not your house - we know she won't leave. Maybe a restaurant if you think it'll keep her in check.) 

And if your husband doesn't agree she's a problem (for whatever reason) then I got nothing. 

Good luck. "	"I don't think you're an asshole for asking him to get his shit together, though if you literally said ""step it up"" that is kind of rude, no matter how warranted.

Nor do I think you're an asshole for bringing this to the teacher to ask that they be removed from your group. Or the principal for his terrible response. 

That said, how far off is this performance? Because, surely, you've had some inkling before now that they are not prepared? That they haven't been practicing or keeping pace with the progress of the other team members? If you've been keeping quiet and just letting them do their own thing without any encouragement or good faith attempts to get them to participate, and have been planning in the back of your mind for some time to kick them out days before the performance, that is bordering on asshole behavior.

It's not your job to babysit or force these students to do stuff. But frequently, the ""unspoken lesson"" in group projects is that it's a team building exercise, and a lesson in how to work with others (however unwilling they may be.) Open communication earlier in the term would have been key so that your teacher could guide you (or step in if warranted.) You should be prepared to answer some possibly tough questions about why you waited until now to make the teacher aware of their behavior, past the point of the teacher being able to do anything about it if they were so inclined. At the very least, there would have been some documentation that they were being little shits, and could have taken that into account when grading the group if they are more hands-off.

Maybe you really were trying to give these folks space in the hopes that they'd get it together and didn't realize until it was too late that that wouldn't happen. But you have to know going in that there is a real possibility that from the teacher's point of view, and to anyone else on the outside looking in, that it might appear that you just sat on your hands and purposely didn't do anything so that they could fall flat on their faces. And that is not in keeping with the spirit of a group project. "	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	1

We know that animals behave as though they have memories— there are studies in dogs, for example, showing that they'll remember visiting certain food hiding locations after some time. But whether those memories feel like our memories is a tough question for scientists to test— we don't yet know whether it feels like a movie reel when animals are doing a task like that. It's an awesome but still very open question.	Your best bet is to practice more. Sometimes it's hard to stay in the moment and be mindful, but with other people  but also in general. Research suggests that practices like meditation can help us to practice doing this better, so I'd recommend trying to get in a regular meditation practice.

If they let this get shared they could do it for $20.  4 a month is enough to see all big releases and more.  That’s a big hit for them to take and they would take it on the movies that people are most likely to see anyway.

484	"**PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS** - For a pretty long time now, I've massively favoured singleplayer games over multiplayer. I pretty much stopped dead on MP after I realised that I was only playing LoL out of routine, and that I was not having fun being around salty internet strangers all the time. Anyway, I was convinced by some people on Discord to play PUBG this week. I'm sure this is old news to everyone else, but I am really loving how intense this game is. It's only been a few days, but I've already had dozens of moments where the pressure is on par with being 1 hit away from killing Darkeater Midir in DS3. Also I had a fantastic moment yesterday where I had to run away from an early game firefight, and was sitting in a small room with shotgun for probably 2 minutes watching the door. After everything had calmed down, I realised that a guy had been crouched in a bathtub behind me with no weapons the entire time. We just nodded at each other and I left without shooting him. 
Anyway, it's been great, and I'm super addicted to it.  

**The Surge** - Didn't play a ton this week, as I was playing so much PUBG. But I did play enough to beat the 2nd boss, and I still think this game is really great. I feel like Deck13 fixed just about every complaint I had while playing Lords of the Fallen. I heard that The Surge 2 was recently announced, and if they stay on their current trajectory, it might just blow my mind. I think more varied environments would probably be the last missing piece for me, and I think they're already on that path - if the Walk in the Park DLC they released recently is anything to go by.

485	"Hi there, great question! I think it is important that we have these discussions about how we can ensure that admission to medical school is an equitable process for those from all social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I am the first person from my family to attend University and growing up no one in my social circle was in medicine. Regardless, I still feel incredibly privileged to have been admitted to medical school and have had the opportunity to pursue the activities that helped me gain admission. Although I would say that from my experience, family income is not an insurmountable barrier to these opportunities! My family is incredibly supportive of the work I do but I personally wanted to self-fund my education. In Canada (and at UBC), I think this is entirely possible due to tuition becoming quite subsidized (compared to medical schools in other countries), student loans are very accessible, and most of the research I've done has been funded by the University or external research awards. UBC Medicine recently posted about their MCAT assistance program that will help lower the costs for students with financial hardship (http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2017/11/01/mcat-fee-assistance-program-for-canadians/)

Regarding your comment about residency placement - I would say from my knowledge, financial or family resources become even less of a consideration at this point. Life experience is not just about traveling the world and I would say facing hardship (whatever it is) gives you plenty of life experience :) Also, your amicability is entirely dependent on you and not what privilege you may have!

I'm not saying this is a perfect system, and undoubtedly it is unfortunate that some groups have a tougher time getting into medical school and succeeding in medicine. However, I do think the system makes an effort to level the playing field and it is entirely possible to build an awesome CV (and career) regardless of your background! "	"One way that I've found to be effective is to first grab the person's email (most people are pretty forthcoming to giving out their email nowadays) and ask if it's okay if I sent them some questions or follow up with them if we were chatting at an event. I'd send my follow up email and usually end it off with something along the lines of: ""... would also be open to meeting up for coffee to discuss this if that's more convenient for you!"" 

What I like about this approach is that I think it's important to be respectful of people's time - and this method allows the mentor to choose what level of commitment they are comfortable with: they can just not reply your email, reply your questions, or go out for coffee with you!  "	IAmA	IAmA	1

I don't think it's immoral to have your child circumcised either.  As you've pointed out, there are certain benefits and relevant medical guidance exists to support such a decision.  I just don't think it's the best possible decision.  I don't think the CDC or the American Pediatric society correctly weigh the importance of bodily autonomy and/or sexual function and are purely looking at the medical pros and cons - of course, these are not the only factors in the decision.

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought mostly Jews considered circumcision a religious practice. A christian family would have a doctor or nurse do it, while a Jewish family would have a rabbi do it.

Then the director and agency will see dozens and dozens of people to pick the right ones.

Seriously though, you think that if you were able to point to a few outliers (which, for the record, you did not do) that means that it would be warranted to dismiss very valid concerns with the majority of people that practice religion today?

The difference between books and films is, films have a bunch of specific, very recognisable visual assets, maybe you could use those.

525	"I honestly wouldn't mind some more NTR anime.  Just because I like tragedy and am sotra bored of these overly romanticized romance stories.  I want a romance that I can actually relate to.  Especially how unrealistic that a guy can get a girl waaay out of his league.  If they do make it they should really stress the fact that the other person ""stealing"" their loved one is in actually a much better person.

Another thing is that isn't harem anime also NTR?  A girl likes a guy only for him to be taken away(most times he chooses a girl).  Or how the girls fight over they guy's affection.  As the girls are ""taking"" him away from each other.  No one bats an eye at these harem shows.  I find this a bit hypocritical."	"&gt;NTR is about inferiority, humiliation and degradation. None of the scenes in harem anime where the MC chooses one girl are painted with any kind of NTR light. 

I mean you could make a case that harem anime does this to the girls.  Having them dress skimpy in fetishistic outfits  Especially maid outfits and call the guy ""master"".  Always being a slave to the guy(doing the chores).  Plus the guy always being in charge and more powerful than the girls.  Having the girls be damsels in distress.  Some shows like Sekirei basically dehumanize the girls into pokemon.

&gt;The focus is all on the guy feeling bad but being honest, the girls pain and (usually) bittersweet acceptance. Framing it as NTR would be the MC turning down his other love interests by kissing the heroine infront of them while talking about how much better she is than them.

He's still being taken away.  It's that most of these shows don't play him off as a jerk while doing it.  I remember in Omamori Himari where the main girl: Himari stated how she's much better than the other girls in the harem because he Kissed her instead of her kissing him.  Rubing it in the other girls' faces.  In many Harems the main girl is usually seen as the ""true"" girl with the rest of the girls(especially the childhood friend who could never compete with a magical girlfriend) being lower.  In harems the guy is still causing pain to the other girls by being dense so still responsible for their suffering.  Imagine dating two girls at the same time and they find out.  I'm not too sure saying ""Well I love both of you"" is going to work out.  

&gt;Do you also complain that there's an endless list of girl characters considered cute by physically assaulting the MC

You mean like tsunderes?  I never really liked them.  I would like more equal treatment in gender assaults.  [Aho Girl was pretty neat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeHWggBIQrA)  However I do admit I love sadistic girls.

Then they don’t. That’s also irrelevant to the conditions to be able to be married.

Yes. Which kind of implies they’re open to having kids.

"I think the main thing was just that the CBJ coaching staff was trying all year to get Johnson and Savard going as the shutdown pairing, and it never paid off. After trading for Cole, he and Savard became the shutdown pair, and they were decent at it. All 3 players were around 55% d zone starts, Ryan Murray rounded out that group around 52%.

With how anemic our forward group was last year, it felt like Jones and Werenski were always going out for O Zone faceoffs just because they were the only D pairing that was any good at creating offense, and the gap to the second best pairing was huge as far as offense goes. 

I think if Jones and Werenski didn't have such great chemistry, that Jones would end up with a more 50/50 split on the zone starts. I also think that if either Gostisbehere or Provorov were right handed and played well together, it would be a very very similar situation to Jones and Werenski.

My arguments for these three games:

Witcher 3 does have separate paths. They are more subtle than most. Do you focus on weapons, alchemy or magic? Maybe a mix of all three. Do you spend the time to craft your gear, or use whatever you find? You also have a wide world of optional content and a story that splits depending on your choices, which is technically more than Oblivion did.

Prey is more iffy, but there are definite different play styles. You can remain human and focus on guns, solve issues with hacking, or maybe go for Typhon powers. Every choice you make with your tool and power set ripples out. Go heavy on Typhon powers and suddenly the station tech sees you as an enemy, adding another layers of issues to deal with. Don't touch them nad you lock yourself out of some of the more interesting abilities. The game goes in hard on reactive gameplay for the role you chose.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance may not have magic, but role-playing isn't defined by swords, magic, thief. Again, it has an open world that lets you make your own mischief, as well as finding your own way to play. Want to tank and spank? Silent archer?

564	So this may not help you, but if you know someone who knits they can probably make you a killer pair of shooting mitts. My mom made me a really warm pair of mittens where the part covering my fingers pulls back to reveal a pair of fingerless gloves. There's a hole on the pad of the thumb that you can use a thumb wheel through and it's really easy to work any of the buttons. I'll usually slip my pointer finger out if the actual mitten when I'm shooting which keeps the rest of my hands warm. I find them perfect because they're stylish enough that I don't feel weird wearing them when it's just cold out and if I take a camera with me I know I can use it, but they're also super functional when I'm shooting. If there's any interest I'll take some pictures and track down the pattern they're based on. 	"Interesting. I've had 3 cases where an item was marked as delivered but I never got it and in all 3 cases they were closed in the seller's favor.

One was settled by eBay, and even though I had messages on eBay from the seller saying if I opened a case they would issue a refund eBay closed in their favor after they reneged. The others were settled by PayPal, same deal. There was no signature or anything, just a tracking number that said it was delivered. There was one case where I bought a cassette from Bandcamp and PayPal closed in my favor because the seller never responded and never sent me a tracking number, but that's a different situation.

579	"I made another reply on the OPs comment in this specific thread line that goes in to more detail. You need to use the proper screen, primarily an IPS screen with at minimum 100% sRGB color gamut coverage. The screen should be calibrated to show accurate colors. You need a printer that covers at minimum 100%sRGB gamut as well, do not print in CYMK mode. 

Make sure to export your edited photo to the correct color gamut you will be printing on. If your screen is 100% adobeRGB, and your printer is set to adobeRGB, then be sure to export to adobeRGB. Otherwise, if your printer only does sRGB, then export to sRGB. 

Lastly, web browsers only display in sRGB color gamut, so don’t export in adobeRGB to host on your website or instagram. 

Doing this will equal prints that are correct the first time printed. Also prevents getting prints too dark or too bright. "	"A couple of things to remember when printing photos or displaying them online. 

Make sure you are using at a minimum a 100% sRGB color gamut IPS screen. Many ips screens can do 100% but not all and the cheaper the less likely. You can get a 100% adobeRGB IPS screen, which is more expensive, but it may be overkill for the next reason. 

Make sure you are editing/exporting in the correct color gamut that you will be displaying (online) or printing to. Web browsers and Instagram will display photos in sRGB gamut. Most professional print services (I personally use mpix and adoramapix) have their printer set to sRGB gamut and request files uploaded for printing be set to sRGB jpgs or sRGB 8bit tiff. If you have your own printer that can print in adobRGB or ProRGB, then it makes sense to buy an adobeRGB screen to edit and print in adobeRGB. But again any web posting will need to be in sRGB. 

The importance of proper color gamut for web and printing can’t be stressed enough. Colors in computers are based on a set of coordinates of 0-256 and displayed as (0, 0, 0) - (256, 256, 256) depending if the color. sRGB has a smaller gamut than adobeRGB which means that a color coordinate in adobe might not represent the same color when covered to sRGB. This is a reason for color banding that may occur in some photos you have seen online where the computer is trying to display the correct color but it doesn’t look right. 

I suggest watching videos and reading more up on color gamut so you can be aware how to get the most out of your edits and subsequent digital or physical prints. 

By being aware of this you can prevent an expensive print coming back with a different tone, different colors, or too dark/bright from what you saw on the screen. "	photography	photography	1

I would recommend [Nox](https://www.gog.com/game/nox) as an ARPG. It's a very good game for being released in 2000. There is replay value in the form of each class. You can get it on GOG. I'm actually impressed that you've hit some other games without playing Nox first.

Darkstone and Fate were kind of cookie cutter.

Transistor and Terraria are not really ARPGs, but are highly recommended.

[Transistor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/237930/Transistor/) is a tactical RPG (ie, Final Fantasy Tactics). There is replay value in the form of a NewGame+ mechanic.

[Terraria](https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/), of course, is a sandbox crafting game. If you are playing it as an ARPG, you're missing 95% of the value.

[Magicka](https://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/Magicka/) is not on your list, but as an isometric action game, would probably fit.

590	You know that there is no longer a penalty of any sort for playing non season. They removed season specific items after the first couple of seasons. You can do exactly what you just mentioned in the game right now. 	"I think you have to start with deciding that at some point, learning to understand item affixes other character building systems is part of the hack and slash, Diablo-clone style games. At some point, a player is going to have to either go look something up on the internet or be willing to test whether item A or item B is better for them based on all of their other decisions. 

I think once you start there, it's about how you pace things out. This is where I think POE is slightly flawed, since you are instantly thrown into the passive tree, not to mention the item/skill systems. The player has to make a ton of decisions so immediately, which is really cool for someone trying to speed run or something like that, but confusing and frustrating for a new player. 

That said, D3's over simplified systems go too far in the other direction. The reason it's so easy for a new player to get going is because there are so few item affixes (split into primary and secondary, further simplifying things), then you have set and legendary powers, which also come from items. 

I think the answer is somewhere in between. for instance, Grim Dawns skill and devotion systems can be a bit much, but it's easy enough to change them. Last I played POE, you get some refund points but not enough to really learn without making a bunch of new characters. GD's item system also ramps up pretty slowly, with legendaries not even dropping until level 50. There are still learning curves, and there is some depth, but the player isn't thrown into the deep end immediately. Not that GD's systems are perfect, I just think they strike a decent balance of having depth but not being totally overwhelming for a new player. "	Diablo	Diablo	1

This is a Rockstar game, so it's going to sell to some people based on that, the GTA Online community is going to partially migrate as well, then you'll have people coming in for the single player open world experience. It's like marketing, it's going to get people in the door, and then they'll try the Battle Royal.

There are a few things I believe could kill this. If Activision adds microtransactions to single player or pay to win it's dead. If it's a buggy or broken mess it's dead. If it's just PUBG but western it might only just take some of the market. Short of any of these I can see a lot of people who just want a skill based no construction battle royal switching.

606	"When I was about 16 I prayed and God answered. I witnessed my first of many miracles. Some of these miracles that I saw healed people, some of them led people to believe in Jesus, and some of them were just there to strengthen my faith.

I still remember the day I prayed bitterly as... a pseudo Christian agnostic. And my prayers most other times included... complaints against him because I was struggling to believe if he was even real. Anyway I was sulking in my stupid teenager problems in a bus when I complained that life really sucked because I couldn't even know if God existed. But something strange happened because afterwards I bitterly complained about how cold it was... And God touched the chair and it became warm. It became so warm that later the guy next to me complained and wondered why the seat was so hot.

I am a rational and intelligent person. And Christians get a bad wrap because they believe certain things without question. (And actually this is good if your faith is well founded because then you spare yourself from all the pain and humiliation that someone like me goes through only to arrive at the very same and humble conclusion some church goers had the WHOLE TIME)Well I believe in Jesus not just because of church or parents but because I witness miracles all the time. Not the kind where you ask for food and then later on you stumble upon it later and then there's this awkward wiggle room for you to consider maybe... maybe it was a coincidence. No. Sometimes when you say something to God he replies right then and there.
But the real problem is... If God replies... What would you say? And the sad thing is I couldn't convince people on that very bus! That God is real.. How much less you some stranger I don't know on reddit? Friend... The world doesn't lack miracles... The world lacks belief in God who does them."	"I don’t know. But I do know that God does very much care about you and the rest of the world, and is in the business of revealing himself to people in personal and tangibles ways.

I know these weren’t all dreams because there’s people that I’ve shared these experiences with... like the guy on the bus or he cashier who gave me the receipts. They’re all very memorable events.

My episode of insanity was a brief period of about 6 months where I couldn’t really come up with linear and rational thought... and I was just really wacky. It’s not how I think today and it’s not how I was when I experienced these miraculous moments.

And about this being a lie... you know I have nothing to gain from all of this. And say if it is all just a story. It won’t change your life at all. But what if this is a genuine testimony of a stranger who realized through some ways that God was alive? And what if this was part of God’s way of letting you know that he’s out there and that he cares for you?

612	Unfortunately, cancer-y games still make a profit as long as a sufficient number of whales enjoy it. It's the fundamental problem with having multi-tiered payment structures is that unless you're one of the few people willing to shell out hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a game, then your refusal to play has a pretty marginal effect on their revenue.	I was looking forward to this, but hearing it's going to be F2P has me worried. I realize that small studios struggle to sustain a player base in their multiplayer games without a free option, but the monetization schemes of F2P games tend to vary between mildly annoying to outright cancer--I would've much preferred a subscription or regular expansion based model, but I suppose I should hold off my scorn until more details come out.

616	Of course. Maybe it's yet to be revealed... whenever I've thought of the curse, I've wondered if it's simply a religious belief that appears as fact to the characters because there's nothing to suggest otherwise (with the Marleyans passing down the Power before the time is up). Thank you for the input!	"*Resubmitted because I'm a doofus*

So the Curse of Ymir involves all Titan Shifters having a 13 year limit to their life once the Power of the Titan has been activated / used for the first time.

Now, I haven't read the full manga but from what I've read on the sub, while this hasn't been exactly proven, there is evidence in Titan Shifters appearing to age more through the years (the Fritz brothers were an example I think?).

What if there was a way to lengthen this limit?

Titan Shifting must take a lot of 'life force' from the person. We see this in superhuman settings in which if they use too much of their power, they can't use it any more and it drains their energy rapidly. That part we see in Eren, with Hange's experiments on how many times he can Shift without much break.

My best theory if this was a thing is: if they devour other Titans (mindless ones namely) then they add to their Shifter lifespan, due to the energy from P A T H S and that goodness. Perhaps if a Shifter devours another Shifter they also get this boost or reset, which Grisha wouldn't have known about (it may not be known about at all since they've been kept separate for so long) and couldn't have explored (since he had no time to).

This is just a theory and for fun! Does anybody have any thoughts on how it could work or other loopholes?"	ShingekiNoKyojin	ShingekiNoKyojin	1

620	"&gt; why a multi-million dollar company paying slave wages 

explain to me what logic you used to arrive at ""Crunchyroll is paying slave wages to animators"" , they  have absolutely no influence on how animators or studios are being paid. Even when they're on production committee, it doesn't mean they have equal influence to everyone there or that they invested equal amount. Streaming services are on production committee to avoid bidding against other licensors for anime and possibly get exclusive rights, there are likely no other perks. 

It's extremely unlikely they can do anything else. You really think Japanese will let western companies just jump in and change how things work? They simply wouldn't allow CR on production committee if they had a problem with status quo."	It depends on what aspect you focus on, and the perspective. Is it immoral to provide a legal way to watch Japanese anime for western audience easily? Or provide simulcasts etc... Should stores stop selling bananas because people who harvested those bananas are exploited? Idk, but it's definitely not black and white. It's also in a way on consumers to not buy bananas, if they dont want stores to stock them.

Sorry, I had assumed that you understood that there are more ways and topics to protest, and more protest groups, than just those engaging in partisan political activities.

&gt;Can we go back to how you've painted anti-abortionists as downtrodden voices silenced by the government akin to gay rights activists? That idea is so ludicrous it genuinely makes me want to know more about how you picture it, especially as you've dodged my questioning about it twice now.

I hadn't responded to it the first time because it hadn't been a question the first time. You had stated it as your impression of what I said, and since that wasn't the topic, I didn't want to derail onto it. If you really want to discuss that part of my earlier comment, if you re-read what I wrote I had not painted them in any such way.

The user I was responding to had made a statement about how (to paraphrase) these groups should shut up and get lost because majority opinion rules. To illustrate the danger of that thinking, I had shown how at one time that very argument could have been directed towards the political opposites of these groups now being closed out of this funding. Had we entrenched ourselves in that thinking, abortion would have never been legalized, and neither would have same-sex marriage.

I had not been drawing comparisons between these groups, but rather to how refusing to allow dissenting opinion can hamstring us as a society by limiting ourselves to listening only to majority opinion. We would become an echo chamber, and cultural development through social progress would cease to occur.

&gt;Do you think these groups would be ok with the government giving them their hired protestor money in exchange for an equal amount being spent targetting the human right of freedom of religion? And then what would they think when the next government comes in and uses the precedence of a-oking protest money against human rights for another pet cause?

There are already advocacy groups out there aiming to decrease the influence religion has on society, including the limits of freedom of religion. And so there should be. I'm betting that these groups are peeved that they get money, but it's only fair to allow their viewpoint to be heard as well.

We need people arguing for and against topics in order to determine where we ourselves stand on the subject. We need to be offended at times to be able to appreciate the depth of our own beliefs or viewpoints, or to grab our attention so we become aware that there *are* other opinions. As I had mentioned in that earlier comment, there are few things more dangerous to a healthy democracy than disallowing dissent."	canada	canada	1

He said he was looking beat up and probably seemed crazy/loopy, smelling of vomit etc.  Was it the best choice? Don't know. He was far from home and family. But not unreasonable either. I'm assuming charges will probably be dropped. As for taking him to the hospital, I imagine they'd only do that in extreme situations because of the potential bill. I'd hate to have a bad night like that and end up owing thousands of dollars to an ER.  $500 sucks and jail is uncomfortable but I'd take that over medical bills any day.	tifu	tifu	1

633	"Okay so for reference, I’m a girl and I’m dating a girl.

So my gf and I are talking about sex. Kinky sex. I tell her I’ve been thinking about some kinks, she tells me to open up to her. I’m really embarrassed and she tells me it’s okay and she just wants to have an honest conversation with me. I tell her about my kinks and I’m feeling really open and vulnerable and soft, you know, how any person would feel. I ask my girl if she has anything to share.

*This is when shit hits the fan.*

“I don’t really think about sex much.” Which my emotional vulnerable brain perceives as “You should feel bad for how much you think about kink and sex.” Later on in the conversation THINGS GET WORSE when she reiterated, “I don’t really think about having sex with you that often.” Now I’m REALLY HURT. Not only does she not think about sex, she doesn’t think about having sex with me! Her girlfriend of three years! 

So now I start thinking I’m ugly AND a slut, all kinds of negative shit about myself. I tell her “Hey look I’m sorry but I was just feeling really vulnerable opening up to and what you said was kind of a hard blow to me in that state.” She says I’m making HER feel bad for NOT thinking about sex. I yell, she yells, I yell, she yells, and now we’re taking time to cool off.

I just really need to know.

Am I the asshole?

TL;DR: Girlfriend told me she doesn’t think about sex with me when I’m already feeling really vulnerable. She accuses me of shaming her for not wanting sex. AITA?"	Yes.

634	"&gt; I nearly laughed, I hadn't talked about Big-O since college

What words do you use to describe algorithms with constant, linear, logarithmic etc. time then? If you still answered the questions you must understand the concepts but don't use the same language.

I don't see what's wrong with expecting someone to know common, well understood terms that are useful for communicating ideas. I see functions all the time in code review that e.g. has n^2 growth when there's an obvious linear algorithm because the author has no understanding of complexity growth as well."	"&gt; You don't need big O to discuss things being slow.

You don't, but it helps.

&gt; Now of course somebody had to implement that Pageable interface, so of course somebody needs to know the performace aspects, but it's most likely a very limited number of programmers.

Wouldn't you like to know what kind of programmer you're about to hire? That's the point of a job interview. I think algorithmic complexity questions are useful for that.

I really don't get the big deal. If you informally know this stuff already, learning what Big O is shouldn't take long and now you have a common language to communicate with."	programming	programming	1

639	The lack of a response to this question from OP is as disappointing as it is predictable. I hope nobody imagines that these support systems are fair and unbiased. The fact is that DV and IPV are consistently shown to be about equally caused by either sex across very many studies. The majority of professionals that deal with it are female and only concerned about the female victims.	"What you say matches the statistics well enough. There are lots of interesting aspects, men are more likely to kill, women are more likely to use weapons. Lesbians are slightly more violent than heterosexuals, gays slightly less. We could discuss the disparities in reporting and prosecution by gender and probably not agree any interpretation so there's little purpose to that.

What I wanted to pick up on was ""why there are more resources for female victims"". The proportion of DV that ends in murder is tiny, less than 1%, statistically insignificant. However, nearly all of the resources are aimed at women. Whatever you consider the relative weight of risk, its not enough to justify women being the only concern in practice. The resources measure all the IPV which happens to men as insignificant."	IAmA	IAmA	1

The point is if you spend X each month and have Y left over to save or invest in some way, you shouldn't need to account for the Y when considering how much money you need in an emergency fund because you're not saving money in an emergency. Your salary *should* always be meaningfully greater than your expenses while you're working, so you should always have some left over to save, which can vary. You shouldn't need to account for that to stay alive.	But that's because you want a year's expenses.

"It’s established at Luis’ party that there’s a pharmacist/drug store located around the corner. I’ve read lots of fans who claim this is where Venkman acquired the thorazine.

I posit that Venkman did in fact have the thorazine on him the entire time, but that he seriously wasn’t expecting to use it. Stanz probably pulled him aside at some point and explained to him what might happen if he encounters a possessed person in the building, and they concluded that enough tranquilizer might do the trick in a pinch."

649	"It would take an act of parliament to bring the whole system down. However, lawyers do challenge the worst excesses where they can, and it's often funded through [Crowd Justice] (https://www.crowdjustice.com). You can certainly contribute there.

You might have heard on the news about a recent case where the DWP didn't like an Upper Tribunal ruling on people with mental health problems who couldn't travel, so they rewrote their own rules. The High Court ruled against this, and so the DWP now has to go back through all its records to find out who had been unfairly debited benefits.

Thinking strategically, the more important thing is the attention these cases get. It's one thing for a campaigner with a placard to call government policy ""blatantly discriminatory"" or to attack the credibility of the government's pet policy experts. But when the High Court says the same, and the government meekly accepts the ruling and does a full 180° policy reversal, that's a front-page headline!

There's another case going through the courts right now. It involves a guy called TP with a life limiting condition who moved to London to be near a treatment centre. This move was considered a change of circumstances, triggering a reassessment for benefits under the new, much meaner Universal Credit system, and he lost £170+ a week as a result.

If he wins this case it will, again, help to highlight a much larger issue that has been largely ignored. If someone living next door to TP developed the same condition, he would also be assessed under the new system and be paid at the much lower rate. This is all part of the government's policy to ""incentivise work"" (i.e. don't let the NEETs get cozy). The courts can't touch that, but if TP wins his case that would certainly bring it to the attention of the media."	I'm very interested in this case, because my situation is very like TP's. I'm disabled and can't work, but the NHS does not offer any proper treatment for my condition to people living in my region. But if I move home, I'm likely to be moved onto Universal Credit and see a huge loss in income.	unitedkingdom	unitedkingdom	1

And it’s especially bad if, let’s imagine, OP asks “Is it A² + B² = C²?” and you answer “yes”, and OP applies this formula to a circle, where A is the surface, B is the radius and C is the circumference.

Of course, it’s actually “A² + B² = C²”. But just saying that doesn’t explain what the theorem is, it doesn’t even show that you know precisely what it is, and sometimes you don’t know where this formula applies and where it does not.

You’re telling me that OP would be correct if they said “Isn’t it a formula? Something with A and B?”. Of course, it’s correct, you can write the theorem with A and B. But it’s not enough.

I’m not saying that OP is stupid and doesn’t even know what the theorem is, and blablah. I’m just saying that I very often see people learning a very very approximative definition for something, and they think they know what it is, but they are actually wrong (even if the small part the remember is correct)."	cringe	cringe	1

Mind you, if I’m super overloaded with my own work, I do less of that stuff, but our lessons suffer if we don’t work together. I also teach my own classes, so that’s some of it. All of that is on top of a case load of about 16 IEPs a year + any other special education work my assistant principal needs my help with. The IEPs alone are substantial and require a lot of planning and writing. I’m also the point person for behavioral plans now. And then I track a lot of the assessment data for the students in my cotaught classes, because that’s part of my work for differentiating lessons. I figure some of this has to do with my current position, but even if you remove those parts (which i identify as the self contained classes and the behavioral stuff), you’re still looking at most inclusion special education teachers having a substantial amount of planning and grading on top of IEP case loads and data analysis.

Steam's job is to incentivize developers onto their platform and one of the ways that they do that is by providing a service (Steamworks + DRM). If you want developers to not use DRM then you need to call them out for it and then call out GOG or other platforms to accept more games."	Games	Games	1

The space is a symptom of him prioritizing himself over you.  Of thinking about his own wants instead of yours.  Of treating you like an after thought.  So if he can't come to grips with the desk arrangement, it spells doom for the rest of the relationship because he simply doesn't respect you.

And once a work is complete, it exists and should be judged outside of the filmmakers intentions and stand on its own. A movie can absolutely be deemed pretentious if it’s clearly attempting a persuasive argument that is not nearly as subtle or poetic as it seems to think.

693	"&gt; Right. They became the majority, were elected, and instated new laws legally.

Well, they dissolved the Weimar Republic.  They abolished the government and its constitution and created a new one.  It was ""legal"" in the sense that the government that enforced the old laws no longer existed.  

&gt; For instance, Trump was elected democratically, and has since made executive orders and signed off on things from Senate. He has put in judges that represented this new populist wave. This is legal for him to do.  If the new laws trump instates represent the current interest of the people, but contradicts the older interest of the people, he is still allowed to do that. He can change or have some laws changed, maybe even regarding how much power he has. 

Yeah... he can use powers delegated to him by the Constitution.  He can ""instate"" laws that have been passed by Congress, which is also elected by the people.  He cannot abolish the law.

They got rid of the laws that protected people they didn't like, because they considered them unjust.  I'm not sure why this makes laws less important than ""justice"".

694	I edited the original comment to go into some of them. As for higher returns with same variance, it's a consequence of linear algebra that any mean-variance efficient portfolio (a portfolio which gets the best possible mean return in the market for a given amount of variance/risk) will make the capital asset pricing model work. For instance, if the S&amp;P 500 index was mean-variance efficient, then the normal CAPM would work as an asset pricing model. It does not, which means the S&amp;P 500 index is not mean-variance efficient. It's possible to use a mix of market beta (the market beta of an asset measures how sensitive it is to movements in the overall stock market) investing and value investing to get a better combination of mean and variance than it's possible by using the market beta alone.	The CAPM is taught as a model, but any graduate student in asset pricing will be able to tell you that it's not working as a model of the world - it's taught more as a historical example/toy model. Modern asset pricing models have the same structure (linear) as the CAPM, but with many more factors (value, size, momentum are three big examples, but the actual number of factors used has been increasing very quickly).	explainlikeimfive	explainlikeimfive	1

You need to look out for your own mental health and wellbeing first. This is the hardest lesson for caregivers like you and me to learn: If you're not caring for yourself, you're no good to whomever you're caring for. In this case, your dad.

To put a finer point on it, if you're not watching what you eat, how much you sleep; if you're not managing your stresses, your own emotions, when it comes time to physically and emotionally be there for dad, you're not going to have the time, energy, or the mental fortitude to push him when he needs you most.

I didn't say either way whether our sense of meaning was arbitrary, and to suggest our sense of meaning is meaningless would seem pretty inane.

I don't actually know what your point is. All I'm saying is that: while a biological basis for morality relies on facts we can agree are objective, it also relies on inherently subjective value judgements.

If your muscles, ligaments, and joints aren't strong enough for high intensity movements, working them into your programming can be extremely detrimental.

I'd like to see any research that shows high intensity intervals are preferable to low intensity base building for injury rehab

&gt;Base building = more strides with worse form. 

&gt;Interval = less strides with better form.

That's not necessarily true. Base building should be done with good  form. And building a base with good form is a good way to *prevent* injuries. Number of strides is only an issue if you aren't recovering properly, which is much harder to do with interval training without a base.

723	"Obviously there is a discrepancy between the depth of mechanics of Melee-pedigree Smash games - including Project M, Rivals of Aether and more recently Icons - and Brawl-pedigree games like Smash 4. That topic has been done to death so I'll try not to draw too many comparisons, except to say that removing mechanics is pretty much by definition going to make your game feel slower, clunkier and overall less interesting. Smash 4 does add some of its own (likely unintentionally in most cases) but these don't make up for the removal of so many others. Even Brawl-exclusive techs like DACUS got the chopping block.

You likely already know this, but in the interest of clarity:

1v1 Smash matches can broadly be divided into 3 distinct ""phases"" - Neutral, combo/punish, and edgeguarding. Neutral is the state when both players are on relatively even footing and are trying to initiate engagements, get in some stray hits or maintain stage control. Combo game is when one player has gained an advantage and is using that advantage to tack on a lot of percent, put the opponent in an edgeguarding situation and kill them. Edgeguarding is when one opponent has knocked the other off the field and is trying to secure a kill by interfering with his ability to get back. 

In Smash 4, punishes are either repetitive or frustratingly short. The hitstun after landing a move is very short, meaning an opponent makes a mistake, you get a few little hits in, they escape and then you're right back to neutral again. If a character can combo at all, it's often either very flowcharty (Bayonetta) or completely linear, spamming the same set of moves until the opponent is high enough to use a finisher (ie. upair, upair, upair, upb)

This wouldn't be so bad if the edgeguarding was good, but it's even more watered down than combos are. Nearly every character has a very good recovery, and every character is able to snap to the ledge from massive distances, the so-called ""magnet hands."" Couple this with the fact that ledgehogging is replaced by ledge trumping, and as a result edgeguarding is nearly absent. Part of what makes Smash so engaging is the thrill of offstage play, that intense high risk high reward combat. But Smash 4, unless you get a hard read it's very difficult to secure a kill offstage. 

So without a solid punish game, and without a solid edgeguarding game, what are you left with? Look at a high level match, like [APEX 2017 grand finals](https://youtu.be/obWXT0WFdK8?t=2309). It's all neutral. These are the best players in the world, and 95% of the time it's two people hopping around, throwing out moves and hoping to get stray hits in. 2-3 moves and the punish is over nearly every time. They don't even *try* to edgeguard. Bayonetta, being one of the only characters with a powerful combo game, is far and away the best member of the cast. But it's not healthy here. She kills him off the top off a stray hit at 25%. 

Add to this the power of defensive options like shielding and the generally slow ground and air speed of the cast, and Smash 4 matches end up playing out more like slapfights than proper brawls. All neutral all the time isn't just boring to watch, it's boring to play. Combos make me feel like I got a kill because I earned it, not because I threw out a move at the correct time and caught somebody off guard.

I can't not mention it: Having to commit fully to a dash hurts. A lot. This isn't exclusive to Smash games either; games that let you quickly turn around just feel better and more responsive than those that don't. Smash 4 players have tried desperately to develop techniques to circumvent this as best they can, but there's only so much you can do. 

Every character feels floaty as hell. I love floaties but even I don't want to play them exclusively. 

[The game has 6 frames of input delay on all controllers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nT2VOLwrqk) 

Rage actively punishes players who are already struggling to secure a kill in a game where securing kills is inherently more difficult. 

Even the hit sound effects are honestly weak, with nearly all of them drawing on the same bizarre bassy crunching sound. 

---

You specified Smash 4, but I still want to mention Brawl just for the sheer egregiousness of decisions made that impact gamefeel. Everybody knows about tripping, but less people are aware of the fact that Brawl had a random 1-3 frames of extra input delay *intentionally built in* to the game. That and airdodging out of hitstun, because god forbid anyone get any combos at all. 

---

There are plenty of valid reasons to prefer the Brawl/Smash4 lineage of Smash mechanics. But Sakurai is not some gamefeel wizard. He frequently neglects gamefeel in favor of simpler, more accessible mechanics. It's only with this newest game that he's decided to walk back on that a little, and as a result Ultimate already looks to be a massive improvement on the Smash 4 formula. "	"&gt;Company makes changes because they are scared of a takeover or whatevet. Takeover or whatever is no longer a threat. Company returns to old ways. Happens all the time. 

Again, that isn't rational. You're trying to apply human psychology to a corporate entity. 

You don't fight a hostile takeover with consumer approval rates, you fight it with *capital*. They needed money to buy more shares and wage a war of attrition. Ubisoft is a multibillion dollar company, any choices it made in the last few years were to raise more money. If they have determined that pro-consumer corporate structure is what makes the most money - as it would seem to be the case, given that this is the direction they chose to adopt at the height of a hostile takeover - then there is no incentive to change that. 

If anything, the takeover attempt incentivized them to focus *even more* on short term gains, in order to fend off Vivendi. And I would not characterize building consumer approval and aiming for wide market reach as being short-term economic strategies."	Games	Games	1

725	That's an incredibly powerful experience to have as a photographer.  Often times we get caught up in the fact that it's just our job, or we're just pushing out pixels and we forget that this medium is a very powerful and emotional landscape.  We are constantly inundated with this photo/selfie obsessed culture that it begins to lose a bit of meaning I think.  As grow with your photography, you will experience the 'last images' or the funeral images.  Sometimes you'll know, sometimes you won't.  First time it happened to me, it changed my entire perspective of what I do, especially when taking portraiture... it became something a bit more sacred and meaningful and it gave me more pride in what my craft is.  Portraiture, no matter the environment it captured is a reflection of that person and that time in their life.  It's something that they are able to look back on as a time in their life, good or bad... or once they are gone, can live on as a memory for all their loved ones.  The images of others that we capture are sacred, even if nobody realizes it at the moment.  The fact that it's on your mind shows how you are impacted by this... take it and embrace it... apply this towards your craft and let it fuel a passion for creating legacies of strangers.

This theory posits that Domeric is the first reek.

Hypothesis 1: Domeric was fathered by a southern lord, not Roose.

Evidence 1: Domeric seems to be well-liked. He plays the harp and enjoys horsemanship, traits of a southerner. No mention of his eyes being the same as color as Roose's eyes. No Bolton Madness to be mentioned. It is mentioned that Roose's wives prior to Fat Walda did not make a sound during sex with him. When Roose discusses Reek, he mentions that ""even his blood smelled bad.""   


The rest of this theory hinges on you accepting this point, so from henceforth let us accept that Domeric was not Ramsey's son for the sake of argument.

Hypothesis 2: Roose found out, and gave Domeric to Ramsey.  


Evidence: Roose is the kind of man that would flay you for spilling his wine. Why does he suddenly decide Ramsey deserves to be his heir? He basically writes Domeric off and promotes Ramsay. Why? Because Ramsey has Roose's bad blood and psychotic tendencies, as all true boltons do. Ramsey has the Bolton eyes, as all true Boltons do.   


What better way for someone as loco as Roose to exact revenge than to give his cuckold son to his bastard son?  


Ramsey reekifies him. He castrates him so that he is no longer a threat to Ramsey's position as heir, as he can't continue the line. He makes him wear flowers in his hair for the same reason. To illustrate the point that this is no true Bolton. For deigning to be a Bolton son.

Hypothesis 3: ""Reek"" comes from ""Dom-Air-Reek""  


Seriously, do we know how Domeric is pronounced? Is it Dom-Air-Rick or Dom-Air-Reek. It is mentioned that a maester diagnosed Domeric with a sickness of the bowels. If this sickness was causing his stench, and the last syllable of his first name is pronounced as ""Reek"", then what better way would there be for Ramsay to dehumanize him?   


The Bolton was stripped from his name, Ramsay stole it. But that wasn't enough for Ramsay. To rub salt in the wound, he stole the ""Dom-Air"" part of his name too.  


Ramsay systemically stripped him of his very name, just as he stripped him of his identity.  


He was Domeric Bolton.  


When Roose found out he was not a true Bolton, he arrived at Ramsay's abode as only Domeric.  


And after Ramsay's torture, he was left with only Reek.

Really the *only* reason it no longer has an atmosphere is because geological activity largely stopped many millions of years ago. Having a magnetic field can help, but geological activity is by far the most important factor in atmosphere thickness. 	100 meters is usually considered sufficient. If you're just standing still, you would probably feel totally normal. You might notice some slight anomalies if you sprint in certain directions, or throw something quickly, though.	askscience	askscience	1
741	True, but you have conservatives like Jeff Flake who pretend to hate Trump to save face but still votes with him an overwhelming majority of the time. 	This administration perfectly embodies what conservatives have been fighting for all along, they just don't like that Trump has no filter and gives an ugly face to their ideology. If he was any other politician who has implemented the things he has, this question would've been answered immediately. 	IAmA	IAmA	1
742	"You're incorrect. 

Some Catholic schools are public institution hybrids which receive some state funds for education programs. The condition is that money does not get used for religious education. 

&gt;[Under regulations of the U.S. Department of Education, **Catholic schools may receive services provided by federally funded education programs.** Schools in the Archdiocese generally participate in one or more programs authorized by the current version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \(ESEA\) \(As amended by Every Student Succeeds Act of 2016 \(ESSA\).](http://archstl.org/education/page/federal-education-programs)"	"So it was an NPR interview. 

The person in question claimed they switched to girl mode an hour ago and he switches back to guy mode during the conversation. 

He states he's in girl mode at [6:30](https://youtu.be/17MT4KHJSS8?t=376) and then they claim his eyes shut and he became a man at [15:50](https://youtu.be/17MT4KHJSS8?t=947). 

Wasn't kidding. "	news	news	1

744	"It is by far the simplest MH game to date, as someone that has played every MH game in the past.

I understand that some people will like the lack of depth when it comes to armour customization, but for myself and my group of friends, we found it a very disappointing feature to have lost.

It's not a *bad* game, at all, but for me it's really lacking a lot of the charm that I personally got from the series."	"I agree.

I think it would be interesting if they allowed us to disable the scoutflies and actually follow the tracks ourselves. That's kind of one thing I was hoping for pre-release.

The tracking seems to be what I like to call 'illusionary depth.' At a glance it seems like something that might be complex and fun, but then it's just about grabbing the glowing points until the game flat out tells you where the monster is.

If they could also not point out every little thing as I'm running around, that'd be great. ""I know what an herb looks like, guys. I already have like 300 potions because you don't need blue mushrooms anymore. Please stop."""	gaming	gaming	1
745	It defiantly better than nothing and you will see great results with a proper diet. However, some people in calisthenics incorporate other movements as well to isolate and target other muscles for symmetry. Check our r/bodyweighfitness.	Correct. You should be able to deadlift more than you squat. If not, that means you are lacking form/programming or your quarter repping squats. Granted, you don't have to deadlift but in that case why mention it at all.	Fitness	Fitness	1
746	"The trouble there is that you imply there could be a conclusion to the series. Ending any kind of fiction is the worst possible thing for the IP holder, which is why so many shows and game series just won't die when they should and drag on for way too long.

But you're sort of close to the original plan for the series, which as I understand it was a trilogy where Desmond gained skills from his ancestors through the bleeding effect in order to have a final game where he was a full-fledged Assassin in the modern day. Ending the series was presumably deemed unprofitable sometime between Brotherhood and Revelations, so it went out the window."	So does the AC Wiki, but I don’t want Ubisoft sidelining content that should be in the games to that either.	Games	Games	1
747	Rapid chargers can recharge electric cars from 0% to 80% in a bit over half an hour. They're found on freeways for use when you need to do long haul. When you're not doing long haul you just top up your car overnight.	They are actually the same cost second hand, I priced them. And utility is better because they are cheaper to run. At least they are where I am; you can get cheap off-peak electricity to charge them. I understand in America this isn't necessarily available due to a market failure there.	technology	technology	1
748	"I have 3 pairs of the THE Short, unlined with the 9 inch inseam. They look better than every other athletic short that I have ever seen which is nice, they are made well, and they’re super comfortable to wear.  Not outrageously baggy like many other offerings either. They definitely can work as swim shorts in a pinch (always a plus) and they dry fast as well. 

The different inseam lengths most of them come in and the lined/unlined option makes them more versatile depending on what you want as well. "	"You’ll want to find a high quality face wash and scrub. Don’t buy cheap stuff with parabens or other crap you don’t want. The wash is for every day or every time you shower, the scrub is heavier duty and is for once or twice a week max because it’s a deep cleanser and should be an exfoliant. 

My favorite brand is Anthony, but I also like jack black. I have had good experiences with lush as well, they do make stuff that works great for men.

Whatever you do, make sure the wash you use is designed for normal to oily skin because it sounds like that’s what you have. 

Beyond that, you’ll want a good moisturizer to use after you exfoliate so you don’t turn into a desert. 

I’d suggest this guy for use as a cleanser:

749	"He's allowed to be whatever he wants, we're still gonna call him out for what he *is*

If you're too jealous to maintain an open relationship where your wife has relations with other men, but not with other women... when you peel back the layers on that onion, it's because you don't see women as a threat or as something to be jealous of

He can and his wife can both be assholes, that's their right. And it's our right to inform them"	"""it's not cheating if it's with a girl"" 

Bisexuals everywhere groaning and rolling their eyes right now. And like what an unsexy thing to say to a bisexual ""hey, you don't count as a person, you're just a sex object right now, there's no risk of romantic involvement here, let me show you how little I value our friendship""

What a crappy thing to do to a close friend. And the way she just kept pressuring you and coercing you? I feel nauseous. I'm sorry op. I would talk to your husband about it and then tell her how upset you are and that you need space for a while. If she apologizes then maybe after the air clears you can try fixing the relationship but that would require a lot of self awareness on their behalf"	relationships	relationships	1
750	"If I remember correctly, I started with some eyeshadows by Essence I found in clearance - it was frosty pink, frosty champagne, bright light green, yellow and two very bold light and dark shimmery duo shadows in blue and sea green. I just used one of them all over my lid and sometimes paired it with thin black liquid liner. I also smudged some brown or black pencil under my lower lashline. Then I got a pink/burgundy and a champagne/brown eyeshadow quads and started creating more elaborate eye looks.  
I only had two lipsticks at that point - Barely there (brownish nude) and Natural beauty (pinky nude), also by Essence. I wore my first bold lip after like two years of really getting into makeup.  
I know the whole thing can be really intimidating. What helped me was also my budget (I was a university freshman), those funky eyeshadows in clearance were all I could afford, so I played with them.  
Eyeshadows are generally a fun and safe bet for experimenting.  
  
I'd recommend getting:  

* a natural palette, something like [this](https://cdn.makeupandbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Essence-Quattro-Eyeshadow-in-05-To-DieFor.jpg) or one of the [Makeup Revolution London Iconic palettes](http://maklinamakeup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Untitled-1.jpg) - these are basically cheap but great complete knock offs of the Urban Decay Naked palettes and you can find tons of tutorials with them on Youtube
* a black liquid liner (unless you're really fair and blonde) 
* black and brown eyeliner pencil
* some mascara (stay away from the huge curved brushes, they are usually just gimmicks and I found them really hard to work with, stick with brushes that look like first, second or fourth from the left on [this picture](http://fazewp.fazemediainc.netdna-cdn.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/mascara-wands.jpg)
* some pinky or mauvy nude lipstick/lipgloss - stay away from the really NUDE concealer-looking ones, they probably won't look good on you
* you can sweep the clearance rack in your drugstore, you'll probably find some fun bright eyeshadows like blue or green, since nobody really wants them 
* you can use your fingers for eyeshadows but I'd recommend getting at least a smaller [pencil brush](https://cdn.makeupandbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Essence-Smokey-Eye-Brush-4.jpg) and a bigger fluffy [blending brush](http://images.ulta.com/is/image/Ulta/2297496?$detail$) . You can get them in the drugstore or, like me, from Aliexpress for like a dollar each.  

I know it sounds like a lot but in reality it's like six products, most of which you probably already have anyway. Then it's all about having fun."	"* Lisa Eldridge has a very unique approach to makeup since she's a very experienced celebrity makeup artist. Her work could be summed up into ""Less is more,"" she focuses on making people look better and more polished rather than just having fun with makeup.
* Sharon Farrell has a ton of useful videos, plus she's not that ""conventionally gorgeous"" (she's pretty but in a different way)
* Chloe Morello goes a bit heavy on makeup but her looks are often very natural
* TheMakeupChair has a lot of tutorials on soft looks for beginners
* Tati Westbrook's channel is nowadays mostly about weird products but if you browse her older videos, you'll probably find something that suits you"	MakeupAddiction	MakeupAddiction	1
751	"It's probably exactly what the Republicans want, too. They'll claim they did what they were asked, and campaign on the idea that a liberal governor had some liberal from California draw up new districts for the hard working people of rural Pennsylvania. The redrawn districts they came up with were probably never intended to pass muster. They were made to fail, so as to give them ammunition to use against the Dems in the elections to come. 

Or at least it seems that way to me."	I don't think there's any way of looking at their actions as a good-faith effort to comply with what the courts demanded of them, from top to bottom. They'll claim they were, though. 	politics	politics	1
752	"My point was that r/pureasoiaf is not *the* sub for book readers because almost every book reader discusses the books here, not there. That subreddit is not well known, it has only 24k subscribers and it is created solely to avoid the show altogether where you can't mention the show even if want to criticise it. The general subreddit where most book readers go to discuss the books is r/asoiaf and hence the book fans who are completely invested in the world, the characters and the story that Martin has created venting their frustration about the show in here is completely natural and silly to complain about.

"	Well, the last book had been out 7 years ago, so there is nothing much else to discuss at this point except for the show that many book fans don't like.	asoiaf	asoiaf	1

Dany is probably the character we can most easily plot out what she needs to do in TWOW because certain things have obviously been set up (uniting the Dothraki, dealing with Illyrio, some follow up on Volantis, and of course Meereen and Slaver's Bay). It is why I have been saying for years that our best hope for Dany is for her to make it to Westeros at the tail end of TWOW. Even then her story would have to move fairly swiftly considering that there are 19 other POVs. Remember that the second Dance of Dragons was only meant to be GRRM's second act. There are still the White Walkers. Dany's story is a big reason why some of us do not see a way for GRRM to finish this in seven books.	asoiaf	asoiaf	1

758	that makes sense. And i guess because God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are all considered divine entities on some level?	"hey lad not sure if you got your question answered but ig the simplest way to explain it would be it’s mentioned multiple times in the bible that Jesus is God’s son which technically would make him part God right? this kind of explains how he would be able to be apart of something as exclusive as the trinity. as for the holy spirit it’s cited as doing God’s will. So with God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit all working together, it can be inferred that’s what lead to what people call the trinity. so while it’s not explicitly referred to as the trinity in the bible it’s implied that they are both closely related and important in relation to each other. 

ig how catholics and other christians deemed those three figure heads as the “trinity” is the same as describing a queen, king, and prince/princesses as the “the monarchy” if that makes sense? except in this case there will only ever be one trinity.

769	"*Some* personality is heritable, not all--as far as I was aware that was mainstream science. You're saying personality traits are *not* partly heritable?

The explanation does explain the increased rates because in communities with large amounts of absent fathers it tends to be the case that dudes who are  v desirable to women have way more kids and those personality traits spread through the next generation. I think this is R vs K theory I believe. In my experience the types of dudes to be absent fathers often have lots of kids by various 'baby mommas'.. almost by definition the guys who are the opposite of that personality type tend to have all their children with a single mother.

I think the genetic thing works on both the female and the male so women who are irresponsible are also more likely to have kids who are irresponsible and women who are irresponsible are more likely to fuck up their relationship or cause their dude to leave or kick him out etc.

Definitely didn't say women don't have negaitve personality traits. Just that those negative personality traits are probably largely set from a young age and possibly from birth and to the degree that they are caused by environment is has proven difficult to show that they can be changed through X intervention (putting them into a better home for example).

And the children can have negative outcomes from losing a father. The prime one being sadness and grief. The question is whether it affects consciousness and long-term planning. My argument is that it *might* and it *might not* and I'd like to know if what I said in my OP had been disproved yet.

You can definitely mess up a child by abusing them but it's arguable that you can create a big difference once you're doing the normal parenting stuff that say 70% of parents do.

775	I'm not saying it's unpopular but his last AMA had 2.5k upvotes and he was far more active on that one. 	"It's an interesting and complex topic. The book that kicked off the ancient aliens idea in pop culture was ""Chariots of the gods?"" By Swiss author Erich von Dänkien. It was released in the 1960s, a time when racial identity was a controversial topic. The book disproportionately investigates cultures from Africa, and the americas and asks how these ""primitive"" and ""savage"" races could have possibly developed advanced cultures and technologies. The book makes the illogical jump that these people must have had help from someone to develop their culture, in this case that external help is aliens. 

Even at the time the book was released it was thoroughly debunked by actual experts in the field. There were mysteries at the time that archaeology couldn't yet explain, and this was manipulated to further the book's narrative. One such example is Palenque's sarcophagus. At the time, Maya hieroglyphics were not understood and were incomprehensible to archaeologists and linguists. Von Däniken suggested in his book that the sarcophagus lid depicted an individual operating a rocket ship. Archaeologists said that the imagery was consistent with Maya religious ideas about death. When the Mayan language was deciphered and the hieroglyphics on the sarcophagi were translated it supported the idea that the image depicted Palenque descending into the Maya underworld. This, however, was incompatible with the ancient aliens narrative. Rather than accept this new information they ignored it since it was incompatible with their idea that a ""primitive"" and ""savage"" race could have developed advanced astronomy, language, and culture. Almost every piece of so called evidence by ancient aliens proponents is just as easily dismissed when the full scope of the evidence is examined. 

In the foundational works of the ancient aliens hypothesis non-white cultures form the basis of their evidence. Africans couldn't build pyramids without alien help but the romans had no problem building the coliseum. In one of his books Von Däniken even suggests that Africans were a failed genetic experiment that was corrected in the European and Asian races. It is important to mention that I do not believe that all the people who believe in ancient aliens are racist, but it is undeniable that the origins of the idea are deeply rooted in racism.

777	Ah yes, you are correct about the magnetic wall. I'd agree - if the magnetic paste continued to impale him and crush him on the magnetic wall side - it would be a better (better as in, more sensible) death scene. Or, if the magnetic field on that wall cycled on and off, keeping his attention (explaining why he keeps staring at weird shit instead of getting out of there, because last time HE LOST A FUCKING ARM) and the magnetic paste was pulled past him, and then released, pulled past and release, until he was dead. That would also make sense for the canister to eventually get pulled off and explode, killing everything in the room	"not really. 

The mag paste was on the repair side of the room. Mundy noticed that the opposite wall had a magnetic event, and lost his tools. while staring at the wall where it was magnetized the paste was drawn to that wall. It was filmed to look like it was grabbing at Mundy, but it could have easily been drawn to the wall just like its tools. There was even a shot of the paste being dragged by the mag field prior to becoming tendrils. 

assumingly, if you want to claim it was all bad accidents, you can say that the tendrils got dragged past him and then the mag field stopped. and the paste retracted to the repair position and was smart enough to fill the voids.... or in mundy's case, accidentally try to repair him to ill effect.

Agree to disagree"	"A couple issues I see with the questions you want answered:

1. You are searching for a counter macro prediction, based in micro. There are not that many macro predictions with a pure microfoundation. I believe this is currently something that is being worked on by ABM efforts though. Micro can have good predictions on microbehavior, but you are also dealing with small groups which exhibit a lot of variation group to group. So the comparison that was made is not a very good one when macro gets to study large groups and can more heavily lean on the law of large numbers to mute effects of small group to group variations.
2. The prediction example in the article is pretty weak. I would like to point out that inflation is highly mechanism dependent and inflation will not always show up in CPI-U. If the monetary base grew because of direct fiscal stimulus measures (think direct lending, helicopter money, guaranteed jobs, UBI, whatever) instead of trickle down monetary approaches (no guarantee the extra money gets lent into the consumer economy), then you would probably see much different results. IS-LM is much too simplistic to consider such non-ad hoc predictions like a full framework would.

If you insist on a better micro based example, Deep Learning macroeconomic models are probably the most accurate framework we have right now (IS-LM isn't really a framework). Deep Learning is already more accurate/reliable than the DSGE framework, and Deep Learning self-trains high complexity models from micro and macro foundational data."	Economics	Economics	1

Which prophet relayed this dramatic change?

In Judaism it takes a prophet to relay new information from God.  You no longer need to obey Mosaic Law qualifies as new information. "	"&gt;”The jews clearly don't understand them otherwise 1) they wouldn't have needed prophets to guide them and 2) god would not have abandoned them.”

So, God prophesies a series of events and then changes His mind because of Israel’s disobedience?

This would mean that what God prophesies doesn’t necessarily happen and God does not know the future, nor can He halfway accurately guess the future. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1
791	Overall, yes. In general, people rate their own local legislators fairly highly, seeming to prove that having representatives do the legislating is a good idea. Think of your town council, if you have one. Do you have many complaints about them?	"It's not perfect, no, but their job isn't really to ""obey"" anyone. We select representatives because the common person wants to delegates his/her opinion on policy decisions that they can't spend time investigating themselves. The rest of us are too busy surviving to read tax bills and budgets, etc. So we try to pick people that we think will best represent us. They aren't beholden to every whim of the people and get multi-year terms so that they're free to use their experience and best judgment, albeit knowing if they want to continue they have to, on the whole, represent their constituency. Direct democracy has been out of style since the Greeks, and, imo, for good reason. The common person can't know enough to be competent legislators."	Libertarian	Libertarian	1

From what I know and understand of the CPF system, I can say that it is better than Australias. Sure your take home is less but its honestly for your own greater good.
You are forced to save, ok so say you're 15? (i'm not sure what the youngest legal working age is in Singapore), and you start work, from day 1, you are saving towards your future and a house. This is a HUGE thing.

Once you finally have a house, if you use what is in your CPF housing find for the deposit, the contributions to the fund from both you and your employeer will mostly cover the cost of the loan. You might see this as a small thing, but this is huge, think about it. You have a huge asset under you, which is costing you very little more to pay off. In the mandatory 5 years it takes before you can sell it, if it was purchased off the plan, you're likely now making more money and if you want, can probably now afford a bigger place.

In Australia we get superannuation, we can't touch it at all till we are 65+ AND retired. This is a retirement fund ONLY. It is around 10% of our before tax salary, on top of our already much higher tax rate. Most companies will give you a ""package pay rate"", so for example say your pay on paper was 85,000, your taxed income is now 76,500, at this wage, tax is around 26%, leaving you with a yearly take home of 56,610. If you're living by yourself or in one of the capital cities, you can then expect your rent and bills alone to be around $2500 a month, leaving you with an actual $26,610 a year for food, entertainment, personal loans, other expenses, savings ect.

I think your CPF contributions are a small price to pay for the huge benefit you get from it and I feel that the system is very much in your interest.

819	"&gt; The majority of iPhone sales, which is what I was talking about.

The majority of people are idiots who don't pay attention to anything.  They do what other people do.  As we saw with the Net Neutrality, the general public doesn't know what it's getting into until what they once enjoyed is now gone.

&gt; If someone purchases an iPhone, despite wanting a headphone jack, that is them choosing the phone over a feature. Which means they don't particularly care about that feature.

If Apple had a concurrent model of the iPhone 8/X with a headphone jack and it sold worse than the one without one then I'd agree with you but as I said Apple has a specific ecosystem that makes it a ton harder to leave.  Many people have still bought an iPhone despite wanting a headphone jack because they're locked into the ecosystem.  They can care and still continue to buy the products, it's not mutually exclusive.

&gt; Someone will keep making phones with them, I'm sure. But it doesn't change the fact there are hundreds of millions people that don't care, or certainly don't care enough for it to matter.

Those millions who don't care enough are part of the issue, just like the hundreds of millions who don't know what net neutrality is and go along with whatever happens like mindless sheep.  The issue is there is no point to this whole change, it's ridiculously anticonsumer yet people are eating up these companies lies.  It's up to the informed to try to spread to people that this is simply the companies trying to screw you out of more money, not to help you in any way shape or form.  At no point has the port done anything to inhibit you from performing any action that a headphone jackless phone could do.  It's a blatant money grab and the trend needs to stop and revert because right now it's just causing more necessary fragmentation because a perfectly working standard across billions of devices is being removed for no good reason with no worthwhile replacement.

We absolutely never do them when we could’ve instead produced a final review and had it posted in a timely manner, because in my experience that produces less traffic, not more. We only do them when we aren’t able to get enough access to a game ahead of time, or if a game is so dependent on live servers that we don’t have confidence that a review based on what we’ve played would be representative of the final experience. 

In that scenario we have two options: we either sit on everything we know so far even though people are hungry for as much information as they can get at that time, or we say what we think so far so that anyone who wants to know can see. It does generate more traffic than posting nothing until we’ve tied a bow on it, but it only generates traffic at all because it’s something a lot of people want. 

Frankly, I’m a little bewildered by the hate we get for that. We aren’t compelling anybody to click on anything they don’t want to read, and if you want to wait for the final review before you look at it you’re totally welcome to do so. But other people want it, so we give it to them. 

If you think the final score is the only thing that matters about a review then I suppose this approach could come across as cynical. But we don’t think about it that way at all. The score is nothing but a code word for a brief summary the reviewer’s opinion - it will never tell you as much as reading or watching the full justification given for that opinion. That’s the meat of it. 

Also, in my experience you never, ever want to set hard rules for how much a score has to be affected by any one factor. Doing so will invariably force you to give a score you don’t personally agree with, which defeats the entire purpose of giving scores in the first place. Again, they’re code words, not math. It just doesn’t work to average them out. 

Imagine you have a game with the best single-player campaign ever, which you think deserves a 10, and a terrible multiplayer mode you’d give a 3. Would it make sense to average out those two scores and give the whole thing a 6.5, even though you want to shout from the rooftops that everyone should play it for the single-player campaign? Personally I think that would be misrepresenting that game to everybody - you’d be telling single-player fans that it’s worse than it is and multiplayer fans that it’s better than it is.

How much gets through is hard to say though. It's a lot easier to try and stop poaching, but you're right, as long as there's a market more will come. 	"I was waiting for this paradoxical argument. This is akin to saying that killing animals in order to save animals is the answer to people killing animals. You don't stop the killing of animals by killing more animals so you can pay for more captive breeding of animals to kill. This is such a BS argument. Of course numbers go up, they are being protected so more can be killed. The inevitable conclusion is that you need an ever-increasing supply of animals to kill but eventually the house of cards will collapse. 

The problem is the idea of trophy hunting and poaching. Both are exactly the same level of indefensible. Being legal doesn't mean it's good. You are getting the word conservation and captive breeding for the sake of slaughter confused. This literally was born of the same logic that most NRA arguments are. 

Edit: in Madagascar child prostitution is legal. It brings in a lot of tourist money. Does that mean that it's good for the children because in brings in money to the economy? That's literally the argument you make, except they don't kill the kids in Madagascar...usually. "	science	science	1

864	"You can also translate the Hebrew to “calamitous” instead of evil but let’s go with evil for the KJV sake. 

He is speaking to King Cyrus’s upcoming reign over the Israelites. He wants His people to know Him fully so they must know that there is a part of God’s nature that is just and scary. God is perfect so his character includes the absolute abhorrence of sin which is His darkness. 

God has allowed evil to do His work to test His people. There is a whole book of the Bible dedicated to this aspect of God’s nature in the book of Job. He lets such horrible disasters and evil strike against the righteousness of Job for what? Simple answer? Because He can. He loves us but we must be able to learn about all of the ways of the true and living God. Not just half of him (the light).

Also a quick note. The first of his creation was the heaven’s and the earth. But then you see that He creates darkness first before the light. Interesting thought as to how God foresaw the fall of Satan and man to use the dark forces of evil against Him. But in the end, darkness can not reconcile light since darkness cannot exist in light. "	"I feel the disagreement will hit a head here so bear with me. God is perfect. Satan is imperfect (but was created perfect). God created everything. 

So here is the full head of disagreement will probably hit. God created Lucifer in perfect nature with a choice that he could make to be prideful enough to think that he could be God.

Look at his account in Ezekiel 28:11-15 which is the perfect being Lucifer:

11 The word of the Lord came to me: 12 “Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

“‘You were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[b]
Your settings and mountings[c] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.

Lucifer was perfect and was there in Eden which means he was perfect in the Garden. Then somewhere in there, he sinned.

Look at verses 16 through 19.

16 Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground
    in the sight of all who were watching.
19 All the nations who knew you
    are appalled at you;
you have come to a horrible end
    and will be no more.’”

Look, God knew that Lucifer would make the choice to sin so in my opinion, God created a perfect place that is earth with the most amazing creation that was man. Lucifer sinned with his pride and was thrown down and it started a wave of events that would be to rectify the sin that was made in heaven by Lucifer by Jesus Christ.

You can see that after Christ was resurrected, Jesus tells Mary Magdalene this:

Jesus said, ""Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' “
John 20:17

He was in a perfect resurrected body and needed to ascend and place His blood on the heavenly tabernacle to rectify the heavenly sin that was committed. 

So TL:DR our battle is not what we think it is:

For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. - Ephesians 6:12

This is a battle of dark forces against the power of light. We are stuck in the middle of it and Christ is the only one that can rectify our souls from the fallen state.

879	"&gt;Women will find themselves wondering if they should resent men and men will feel guilty for sins committed by other men. Women are not going to find this message appealing and men will find themselves feeling even more awkward

I dunno man, in my experience no one can make you feel guilty. Maybe there is some deeper unresolved issue. I'll just give you example from a time in my life when my mindset was completely, and guilt and shame for being a man was at the top of my list.   


As men we get TONS of messages around what it means to be a man. The biggest conflict for me came from not wanting to be THAT guy. The stereotypical misogynist , sexist or all the bad things that are attributed to men. But also feeling inferior because I didn't get the girl, or I didn't get &lt;insert thing of desire&gt;. Were told ""Nice Guys Finish Last"", were told to need to be Alpha's, and ourself worth is either how many women we can bed, or how much money we have in our pocket.   


So all when we have all this  frustration with our situations, it starts to sting when people say we have an advantage (privilege). We go into defensive mode... because we feel its a personal attack on us, which is outrageous... I have problems...  my problems matter you don't have my problems, you have X,Y and Z easy. Yada yada yada... It quickly devolves into a race to who has it worse instead into a conversation around hey lets have some empathy and work to make life better for each other.   


Ultimately Feminists can change the messaging, but I don't think its gonna change the reaction or even your own feelings of guilt when the underlying human flaw is to always gonna protect its ego. I'd rather ask... hey what exactly are you feeling guilty about, because NO ONE is saying it Not OK to be Man... But I'm sure you feel that way. Why?"	"&gt; Because it could threaten him. Diversity metrics could result in him getting passed up for a job, promotion, etc. It's pretty obvious.

Its sounds paranoid. The assumption that aiming for a diverse workforce means less for another seems like a pretty giant leap to make.

Especially when it pertains to software development, where our hiring processes and even our ability to measure a programmers performance kinda really sucks. The idea that a GOOD programmer will be overlooked, to the benefit of a Mediocre one. Doesn't have any basis in reality, because we don't have a good way of keeping good metrics.

&gt; Take something patently obvious, like the front line of a NFL team. Sex based preferences, on average, may lead to less women desiring to play football.

Testosterone does not make a person any more capable or willing to be software developers. So comparing it the NFL seems really disingenuous here. We can measure physical feats, and can objective measure the physical abilities of 1 person over another is REALLY easy with sports. Not the same with software dev, not even close. 

Whats so special about Software Development that makes you think  they are less capable? Ok maybe your aren't saying they are less capable, although thats what it sounds like when people constantly bring up biology as some kind of factor. Even though there seems to be NO scientific evidence to back up the claim. The claim gets repeated.

I'm not trying to draw a comparison who has it worse, modern woman or the woman's suffrage movement. I'm drawing a comparison to the rhetoric. The Biology argument that women can't to the job of a man, or isn't good enough, or isn't as capable, or is simply disinterested. 

&gt; Show me the hordes of women who want jobs programming but are denied because of their sex? The situation is apples and oranges.

I can't show hordes of women who are denied for jobs, because when I speak with women about this. They point to the hordes of men who make arguments like yours, essentially telling them to NOT bother trying. Hell some might even come to believe what your selling. All I have is anecdotal evidence, and stories and a genuine interest in seeing people pursue a career in software development.

I can't for the LIFE of me explain all this gate keeping thats going around? I can't explain why a diverse workplace is a negative thing, and why the word diverse has become a bad word. Especially in programming where we can't measure performance like we can other professions, or feats. Hell programming isn't even ALL mental, and ACTUALLY has very little complex Math, if any.There is an emotional intelligence component to it as well as you need to be able to work well with others, and know how to communicate.

Yet even you fail to give me an adequate reason for all this defensiveness. Helping out someone else who isn't a white male, doesn't make you less. Encouraging other people to pursue a job in this career doesn't mean less for you. And making a workforce diverse isn't a bad thing, why is the assumption automagically someone took my job, and they deserve it less? Last time I checked there were more jobs that people to fill them. And all I've ever seen is Diversity be pushed to help encourage more engagement and participation in a field.

i remain unconvinced, and continually dishearten by the conversation and the extreme reaction to trying to allow our career be more accessible. We aren't special, and what we do isn't hard or require a penis."	programming	programming	1

883	Bobtail squid certainly don't seem to like me even though I've raised them since they hatched, but the cuttlefish and octopus know individual people for sure. I think the bobtail squid also know individual people but they're not as good at connecting positively. So for example, once I draw blood from a squid once, those squid tend to ink at me a lot more once I walk in the room compared to others. They never seem happy to see me though (unlike the cuttlefish and octopuses)	"1.) This is tough to say because generally speaking measuring and comparing one animal's intelligence to another's is REALLY challenging. There's a really good book on this subject and if you're interested in animal intelligence, I would suggest reading it, it's called ""Are We Smart Enough To Know How Smart Animals Are"". I recommend it.  As far as social intelligence, that's also hard to compare. Which cephalopod is best an interacting with humans to get more food or attention out of us? Probably octopus. Which is best at forming social groups for hunting? probably the schooling squid (e.g. humboldt squid). Intelligence all depends on the context of the type of life the animal is leading. If it's really important to build a den and stay hidden, the octopus is the ""smartest"" at decorating its den, changing color and texture, and staying out of harms way.  If it's important to communicate with your peers using flashing color displays and working together, maybe the humboldt squid is smarter.  If it's important to be able to cross-dress and pretend to be a female to get to mate with a female, then the giant australian cuttlefish is the smartest. If it's important to communicate verbally, a dolphin has them all beat. 


2.) A lot of squid have very short life spans. When you're the prey item on the menu for a lot of animals you need to be really effective at breeding fast and making a lot offspring.

My unwillingness to consider marriage wasn't easy for my parents to accept; we're South Asian, so family is a pretty big thing in the culture.

906	"&gt; And Scala does not help its own case by not making these benefits first-class native language constructs

How do you mean, Scala comes with flatMap, map, fold, reduce, etc. out of the box, and for comprehensions are Scala's answer to Haskell's `do` notation. Implicits and higher kinded types provide the machinery for encoding type classes. Sure, typeclass definitions are more verbose than Haskell, but they're equally (if not more) powerful.

Anyway, compared to Haskell and the ML family every statically typed language is verbose. At least with Scala you can actually match Haskell feature for feature; the same cannot be said for other mainstream-ish languages."	"&gt; I've been wondering about the effect of Dotty/Scala 3 on rankings like this

Next to zero.

Dotty's been in development for many years now; it may land in 2019, but could just as well be 2020. Union types, the new enum syntax, implicit function types, etc., along with general language cleanup will be nice for sure, but it will still be Scala. Which is to say, the compiler will not be fast (expected 2X speedup is gone, will probably build as fast as present day Scala); SBT is still the primary build tool; new macros are very much a WIP, and TASTY, not sure if or when that will pan out.

Basically there's a ton or work left to do, and whether or not the end result is a massive improvement over the to-be-sunsetted Scala compiler is still very much TBD. Saying that, hopefully Dotty will come sooner than later, looks like, on paper, it will be a massive improvement."	programming	programming	1

That's all I was looking for. Because you said the magic word ""Obviously."" Of course it's obvious to be Boy #2 instead of Boy #1. 

But if it were *totally* obviously the better option, your brain would be choosing it already. This means that part of you *doesn't* fully believe that the #2 choice is the obvious superior option. You'd agree? 

The part of you that doesn't want to change is your lower brain. It's what keeps you playing video games, staying inside, not going to class, and fapping. It's what makes you feel like you'll explode on Day 3 of NoFap. 

But your higher brain is the one that's all aboard for improving. Your higher brain is unsure if it can convince the lower brain to ""commit itself or take responsibililty."" So what you need to do is give your higher brain a reason to keep trying. To keep trying. To keep trying. And trying. And trying.

Failure is essential to growth in everything we do. **Growth and comfort rarely ride in on the same horse.**

So do you want this *bad enough* (specific improvement) to be willing to keep trying in the face of failure, even if you fail several times? This is no gentle question. The brain (lower or higher) that makes you answer this question is the one you need to support.

&gt; Maintaining a bunch of local type safe bridges to them is not too much hassle, but actually forking them and maintaining HHVM-specific versions would be a whole 'nother story.

This would be required eventually even if we maintained PHP support as-is. You won't be able to pull in updated versions with security fixes, for example.

Reading through your comments, it sounds like you don't want to go back to PHP. So, if I'm following, your choices are:

1. fork dependencies, migrate them to Hack
2. move to hack equivalents of dependecies where available/creating where not (likely a mix of this and 1)
3. transpile to ????, fork dependencies and transpile them too
4. transpile to ????, migrate to other dependencies
5. rewrite to ????

3-4: You'll want to be particularly careful around `==` and `switch()`, possibly rewriting to `php_equals(a, b)` and replacing switch with `if (php_equals(a, b)) { ... } else if (php_equals(a, c) { }`...

2. For 'core' libraries, I'm planning on doing similar (for example, I have a PR up for `hhast-migrate --phpunit-to-hacktest`), but ultimately we can't do this for every PHP library that people use.

You people forget that this was a genjutsu put on Naruto first of all and that Itachi can’t just point at someone and immediately put them under genjutsu. I don’t know if this was exactly explained in the anime or manga but in the Itachi Shinden novel it was explained that in order to put someone under genjutsu both of your axis’ of chakra must align with one another, this is why sharingan genjutsu is so powerful because it’s used by looking into the opponents eyes which perfectly aligns the two axis’ of chakra. The reason Ephemeral worked on Naruto, well for one it’s Naruto who at the time was someone pretty easy to catch under even the simplest genjutsu, is because Itachi simply concentrated his chakra and genjutsu into his finger. Then Naruto stared directly at Itachi’s finger for a good 30 seconds and boom the chakra axis’ are aligned and Naruto is successfully under Itachi’s genjutsu. I highly doubt this genjutsu would work on many other characters, let alone Madara. 	That was one level two eye and one level one eye though.

"	"Well the data stream gets split across all the channels, but when a burst of static comes along, it blocks the whole set. So it basically falls over and has to reset, and go back to a lower rate.

I guess it depends how long the static lasts for. I expect that a short burst can be handled by Forward Error Correction, but once the FEC falls over it has to restart.

Imagine a noisy air-con thermostat, every few minutes or so it puts out a ""brrrrt"" that lasts for 20 secs or so. Would be the same as pulling the plug on the data lead.

The other point is that to get anything like the promised data-rate, the modem has to use as many channels as possible. So it is constantly pushing against the limits, no mater what the line length is.

Apparently you can be switched to a more conservative profile, which trades a lower data-rate for higher stabilitity (less drop outs).

To me, the passion bit isn't really a big deal, every musician or artist or game dev has loads of passion, but I can't watch/read/listen/play their passion, I receive an end product, and Rare has underdelivered here. I'm not buying games out of sympathy, this is a producer-consumer relationship at the end of the day. "	Games	Games	1

"	"Hi there, great question! I think it is important that we have these discussions about how we can ensure that admission to medical school is an equitable process for those from all social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I am the first person from my family to attend University and growing up no one in my social circle was in medicine. Regardless, I still feel incredibly privileged to have been admitted to medical school and have had the opportunity to pursue the activities that helped me gain admission. Although I would say that from my experience, family income is not an insurmountable barrier to these opportunities! My family is incredibly supportive of the work I do but I personally wanted to self-fund my education. In Canada (and at UBC), I think this is entirely possible due to tuition becoming quite subsidized (compared to medical schools in other countries), student loans are very accessible, and most of the research I've done has been funded by the University or external research awards. UBC Medicine recently posted about their MCAT assistance program that will help lower the costs for students with financial hardship (http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2017/11/01/mcat-fee-assistance-program-for-canadians/)

Regarding your comment about residency placement - I would say from my knowledge, financial or family resources become even less of a consideration at this point. Life experience is not just about traveling the world and I would say facing hardship (whatever it is) gives you plenty of life experience :) Also, your amicability is entirely dependent on you and not what privilege you may have!

I'm not saying this is a perfect system, and undoubtedly it is unfortunate that some groups have a tougher time getting into medical school and succeeding in medicine. However, I do think the system makes an effort to level the playing field and it is entirely possible to build an awesome CV (and career) regardless of your background! "	IAmA	IAmA	1

People might find it helps them feel better to get everyone’s sympathy, but it certainly doesnt help get closer to the solution and it did nothing but bring down the person who they got the pity from. As the helper we have to be aware of the way the other person feels, but as someone with a problem we cant just forget all of our manners and think its okay to go around seeking pats on the back from everyone.

The US benefited more than any other country from GATT and WTO (until 2001 when China got in). The reason the US pushed for free trade was because most of the world's economies were decimated post WW2 and the US wanted to capture the market. It also had a lot of excess production capacity from WW2 that needed deployment. This is why the US economy grew so rapidly.

&gt;We subsidize Europes military.

No you don't. I guess you mean NATO funding? The loss of the EU to USSR (directly or through coups) would have been catastrophic for the US so that is why you did it. As for doing it currently - I don't think the EU needs it. The EU spends 300 billion dollars on defense vs 60 for Russia. The EU countries also sustain the US Military Industrial Complex - take a look at some European air force inventories.

There are still 100 times less toxins or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH's) you vape if you compare it to smoking. But still there are a few if you are 100% objective. These all come free with cannabis that is toxinated with pesticides, and other chemicals. A lot of people don't realise that in most cannabis there really is crap that they did put on. People don't seem to realise where the cannabis all went before it goes into your joint or vape. I myselve allready had a few times weed with crap sprayed on. A lot of times you can see it when your joint starts to make cracking sounds, taste weird, or flash shortly. For example it's quite common that people spray hairspray on it for extra weight. That's why biological cannabis is always the right choice (if you have the choice)

The main toxins that could do some sort of harm are Benzene, it's carcinogenic and gets triggered at 80.1°C

Also Naphthalene isn't scientifically officially known as carcinogenic but it has potential. It causes dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite and pale skin, the boiling point is 218 °C.

In other big eSports games, like CSGO or Dota 2, every contents (characters, maps, etc.) update are free while cosmetics aren't.

I read your statement, which emphasizes Jesus as the 'Son of God' and this part:


&gt;he was the Son of God and that God lived through him in his perfection.



which would lead any normal person who isn't you to understand that you're implying Jesus was simply the 'Son of God' and not God himself. Since God is living through him. To the trinitarian Jesus is God, so the only way that statement would make sense in the trinitarian perspective is if you meant/said the Father was living through him. And even then it doesn't make sense because traditionally the Holy Spirit lived through Jesus and the Father was up in heaven sitting on the throne... therefore there seems a gap in your understanding of the trinity (which is why I said it 'explains a lot').



Also, trinitarians would always put the trinity in their statement of faith, always never fail it's like they're waiting for someone to ask them for it. But you didn't, which is good reason enough to make me suspect you're possibly not a trinitarian.

I mean, I can't afford tickets and can't drive 6 hours to Raleigh so I guess I can't like Primus. The only legit music in my world is the kids who play at the bars in my town for tips I guess because I don't have to break myself to see them. 

And I think people like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/8c1cht/why_some_modern_songs_are_impossible_to_perform/dxbs2mc/) are just covert bragging about how much spare money and time they have to go see shows. Or some other kind of bragging. Basically bragging. 

Live performances *are* the inferior medium objectively because I'm 30 and I've listened to and enjoyed many, many hours of Bob Marley, The Beatles, The Dead Kennedy's, Queen, Pink Floyd, Hendrix, The Who, The Ramones, The Clash, The Velvet Underground, The Doors, The Kinks, Marvin Gaye, Nirvana, SRV, and so many more. It was only *possible* to enjoy 99.99999% of the music I've enjoyed my in my lifetime because of recordings. So live music elitists can eat a burlap sack of dicks. 

Yeah, I would have loved to see The Beatles play live. If I could choose between traveling back in time for a show OR have access to their recorded discography, it's a no brainer. I want Revolver, Abbey Road, The White Album, Help, Sgt. Pepper etc. in my life. "	"Yeah I suppose some of it is predicting the wrong things but I still think people are hasty. 

As far as robots and AI, a lot of those predictions are in the direction we've been heading but we're way behind. Decades ago, people expected robot butlers, today we've got Alexa, smart fridges and roombas. There's tons of automation in manufacturing. Companies always jump at the chance to replace human workers but all we've accomplished are glorified welder bots. People expected Mars colonies and that's always been on the agenda but we're way behind on those predictions. 

I don't think it's *all* because our tech has gone in different directions. If we were developing technology faster, we very well might have ended up with a robot butler instead of Alexa. 

If people in the 50s knew how big computers and internet would be, they still probably would have thought that It'd be way ahead of where it is now. In the 90s when people could tell computers and internet were the future, they expected everything to be connected, cheap, and easy. Instead I've got meager and expensive internet access, a separate and expensive phone, separate TV. 

I dunno. I kinda think technology *is* slower than people like to think. Still really fast on a long scale, but slower than people like to think. I wonder if a manned mission to mars is in my lifetime or even my kids. It seems like it *should* be soon-ish the way technologies are heading but predictions are hard. "	videos	videos	1
1029	I think you mispelled USSR, who fought the majority of the German army, suffered the majority of the war losses, and killed and wounded the majority of German forces. Churchill played an important part, but it's a bit ignorant to take the largest credit away from the USSR, who earned it in blood.	"Firstly, it was the Soviets, not Russia. Many non russians fought and died in that war; it's a disservice to erase their existence. 

Secondly, the Soviets did not win because of winter. Sure, winter helped, but they won through adaptation and development of genuinely good military strategy, especially maskirovana. 

Thirdly, almost 30 million dead Soviets says that they had the most blood in the game.

And lastly, a non agression pact is not an alliance. Furthermore, the Soviets sought an alliance with the western powers--something Britain and France were unable or perhaps unwilling to sign onto. The Molotov-Ribbentrop was signed only after the failure of those talks."	worldnews	worldnews	1
1030	"Considering that conservatism these days equates to institutionalized white collar theft, I’d say we’ve strayed pretty far from any semblance of a reasonable definition for political discourse. 


It really can’t hide behind “competition and hierarchy” any more as these buzzwords really just been twisted at every opportunity to make citizens feel personally responsible, guilty even, for getting fleeced by corporations they have no voice in. 


Collective resource management and smart regulation is literally the only way conservative values have a chance at ringing true. Workers rights and consumer rights are the only thing keeping the market from crushing the middle class, even most “free market” models require heavy regulation to even start sounding sustainable. People really need to get past the idea that Medicare for all is incongruent with conservative values. "	Indeed. Lots of nations win the resource lottery.

1034	"- People all ages need/use lube. If it makes sex more comfortable for you, use as much as you need.
- Women definitely should **not** use soap on or in their vaginas. For a penis, warm water should be enough, although I do sometimes use some body wash on mine when I'm lathering everything else up. The human body is covered in bacteria and you'll never eliminate (now would you want to) all of that. BV, UTI's, yeast infections, etc happen when something throws off the bodies normal balance. Often times, soap itself is the culprit. 
- If he's making your asshole bleed with his fingers, he needs to be more careful. This could cause you to have issues with hemorrhoids, or other problems. He may need to use lube for these activities."	Lol not arguing against condoms at all... just disagreeing with this reasoning about marriage/being ready for kids...

1035	"Well yes, that's a thing. I remember when 2 nurses and I struggled to lift a patient into a chair...we couldn't and we had to get a special contraption to lift this guy. In hospitals, you get the luxury to be able get extra help. But in nursing homes, there is usually just one person assigned to moving a patient and that person is usually a scrawny young girl, not the experience burly women. Just doing basic stuff like getting a patient in and out of bed makes it a living hell for all involved.

But that's not even the biggest issue. Some forms of diagnostic equipment are impossible to use on obese people. Want to do an echo/ultrasound on an obese patient? Almost impossible to reach the organs with your equipment. You can't even test for galbladder irritation.

Want to do an EKG (ElectroKardioGram) to check for heart-problems? You can't because the heart is insulated by such a thick layer of fat that you only get microvoltages as readouts. No use to anyone and very dangerous if a patient is sent in for a heart attack. 

Some patients for example don't fit inside an MRI. So believe it or not, some morbidly obese patients are sent to special clinics which has special MRI's designed to fit horses. Those MRI's are normally used to check-up on horses used in horse races and for the horse industry in general. But as you understand, it takes time and proper scheduling to make use of such a specialized MRI. This can in turn result in diagnostic delay.

Any kind of surgery just takes longer because you have to get through layers and layers of fat. When you need to close up, you have to sew these layers back together again, taking much time as well. Surgeons lose much of their sensation of touch when there is much fat involved.

Want to do keyhole surgery? Almost impossible to even maneuvre the camera. I once had a laporascopic uterus removal cancelled mid-surgery because the patient was too obese to identify the structures involved. 

This is some real shit doctors have to deal with and we have to go through hoops, improvise and deliver subpar medicine to those that are (morbidly) obese. Then they get all offended for stating the obvious."	"Some people are secretly comfortable with their weight but their environment is pestering them to lose weight. So they want to lose weight because someone told them to, but their personality won't let it. So there is this half-assed attempt to lose weight but they just don't care enough to fully see it through.

Then they complain how losing weight is hard. They're not being true to themselves. Telling people that you are comfortable with your weight is even a bigger sin than trying and not losing weight."	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	1

I don't know that you would be in that camp.. it's just an odd thing I've noticed, and I'm genuinely curious what the difference is there."	"I recall reading a post on here a few months ago where the OP came home to one of their dogs having literally hung itself on the fence, because OP's partner had just put them outside and neglected them for the several weeks they were gone. It was probably one of the sadder stories I've read here.

Had the orcs been executed, the kingdoms of the Alliance would've remained together as a monolithic bulwark against invading forces from beyond their world.

Hell, the full Alliance may have even heeded Medivh's council when he warned them of the coming Scourge.

Even in the worst-case scenario of Arthas falling to Ner'zhul's corrupting orchestration, there would have been far more surviving humans and elves that would be able to retreat to Kalimdor. Humans as a naturally diplomatic species would have made an earlier bid for cooperation with the night elves rather than committing to a full invasion following a misunderstanding. Hell, the only reason the night elves attacked the humans in WC3 was because they were high-strung after the orcish attack and found Jaina's humans working with the orcs and mistook them for accomplices. Realistically both sides would have lost far fewer forces and the final defense of Hyjal would have simply substituted the Horde's forces with Gilneans and additional high elves."	wow	wow	1

AMD cards are a better buy than NVidia Currently.  An Rx 570 (about $140 AR) will be good for 1080p 60fps at high settings, a 580 ($200-210) will do mostly ultra settings.  Both of those cards come with download codes for 3 games (AC Odyssey being the most popular) as long as you buy them from an approved vendor."	"Aorus is a model made by Gigabyte, while Sapphire is another manufacturer.  The base chips are manufactured by AMD and sold to other companies to complete the gpus.  The differences are usually based on the cooling solution and power delivery, with this generation of cards the results are fairly close, noise being the biggest drawback on some cards. Sapphire is generally considered to be better than Gigabyte for gpus.

4 and 8GB is the amount of vram.  It is the amount of memory on the card that allows textures to be loaded.  If you run out of vram your performance will tank while the textures are loaded from your hdd or ssd. 4GB is enough current games at 1080p but 8GB will remain relevant for the foreseeable future (I would spend the extra on 8GB if I went for a 580, 4GB on the 570).

My 2012 laptop was solid, looked like the day I bought it when I sold it.

But beyond the headphones...

I get the feeling that Apple is catering to prosumers and leaving pros behind. But again, perhaps in an age where everyone is a YouTube or Twitch star, this makes sense.

I live around 10-15 miles from Central London and unless for some reason there is zero traffic and a parking space instantly available the train will always be faster. To try and do it via buses though would be a joke and would take hours.

I've met waiters in America who drove stupid distances to get to work and back. I think one said it was 80 miles and took about 2 hours each way. That kind of thing is pretty much inconceivable for us."	"You also have the classic 'you wait ages for a bus and then two show up at once' situation. Which is ultimately an inevitable issue that is difficult to avoid because the first bus is more likely to have to pick people up at every stop so the next catches up with it. Mostly the problem with them though is that they are subseptible to traffic so without bus lanes the whole way are always going to be slower than cars.

""pulls hard"" ""grips corners"" ""clean interior"" ""mint paint (probably repainted)"" ""only 50,000km! (probably rolled or a swapped cluster)"" etc.

They're fun, and for what they were - they were ahead of their time when they were new cars, but technology has quickly outpaced the advances of the era. I don't think they're bad cars by any means, but when you have the opportunity to drive an STi/Evo X or 90s GT-R, you're going to get objectively better handling, control, amenities from the newer cars.

Misconceptions that people have about them:

1. They're fast - not really, at least stock. No faster than a WRX or base model Mustang.
2. They're cheap/easy to maintain - nope. Expensive and hard to source parts makes them quite expensive. Not luxury car expensive, but I've probably dumped over 2k in mine and I've had it just over a year for basic maintenance.
3. They're rare - pointed out in the article, not really. They're unique/uncommon in the US, that's about it.
4. Easy to mod - subjective. I'm an enthusiast, not a shop mechanic. I look at value added upgrades and pricing starts shooting sky high. Good turbos for a twin setup are about 2-3k new, a single turbo swap actually would cost me more because everything would have to be rebuilt/custom and then a new turbo.

These are great cars for people who want to relish or embellish the experience of owning a Japanese legend, and for those who are capable of either a) affording someone to work on the car, or b) able to perform the work yourself. Other than that, there's much more capable, newer cars available today.

The one very key and important part of the Skyline GT-R is that they've already hit the end of their depreciation curve/cycle. The prices seem relatively stable, but you'll notice gradual price increases over the past several years and I think the hope is that once the hype dies out - anyone who owns and maintains one for any decent length of time will come out ""ahead""."	"Various reasons like saving weight, removing a system prone to failure, early ABS examples weren't that great, some drivers just prefer managing their own braking, especially if you left foot brake on tracks.

The GT-Rs were basically modest sports car designed with the intent to be modified into race cars, therefore a lot of the technology in them was added for the average driver, but most of it was most likely designed with the forethought to be removed or modified in some capacity for track/circuit racing. You see similar things like this with modern day supercars like the Porsche GT2/GT3."	cars	cars	1

I would say that, yes, it does. There is language and words, and somebody wrote it (human authors) and somebody thought it (God).

&gt;how would you support your claim?

There is plenty of evidence out there for Biblical inspiration, I won't list them here. One main reason is that the Bible is the most textually pure historical work ever written by a huge margin. Regardless of how many times it has been translated and reprinted, it remains superiorily accurate. Whether or not you believe what is written about things we can't empirically prove is a personal issue. There is plenty of evidence out there, and as far as God is concerned, I think that there would not be any reason to think that He would not give us a record of His workings with us, and if He wrote laws and guidance down (because it is so extensive) He would most likely choose written form, as this is the best way to communicate complex ideas.

So it is up to entrepreneurs to create how this would actually be done. 

In my professional opinion I would want the diamond to be pictured by the miner and with the miner. Then his family and employer all verify he is not a slave and is paid appropriately for the diamond. Then the transportation is logged by RFID and employees. The jeweler is logged for splitting/ cutting the diamond. Who the jeweler sells them to is logged. Who buys the diamond is logged and the miner could even see the lucky gal or rapper the diamond ended up on. 

It would have to be completely transparent. I would be able to call up and ask any of the people on the diamonds life and verify. And also I would include an incentive for journalists, miners, employers, and activists to prove that all the diamonds on the blockchain are in fact slave labor free. The incentive is the most important part because it will keep those who want to lie under check, especially with the punishment that once they are caught they would get kicked off the blockchain and potentially have to pay all of those involved. "	Decentralized validation is more secure than centralized validation for some industries. I don’t trust DeBeers diamonds to actually be slave labor free for example because it’s in their best interest to lie about where the diamonds come from. However if there was an independent agency with a decentralized ledger I would trust them much more. This aspect of the blockchain could work for art, collectibles, oil, finance and more.	programming	programming	1

There is clear, unequivocal evidence that on average, work is generally good for a person's physical and mental health, providing structure, social contacts, physical and mental activity, social status, a sense of identity and financial resources. People who are unemployed tend to have poorer physical and mental health overall, consult their GP more, are more likely to be admitted to hospital and more likely to have higher death rates. Long term unemployment makes this even worse, with much higher levels of depression and anxiety. 

Returning to work, if you are able, significantly benefits mental ill-health, helps recovery and is the best way to prevent long term sickness. It has measurable health benefits, particularly for people with mild or severe mental health problems. 

From that perspective, an immediate, forceful push to get people back to work as soon as possible rather than on benefits in the face of unemployment is in the interests of the individuals in question, and a harsher benefits system a mechanism to achieve that. 

There are plenty of legitimate and reasonable criticisms to be made of this position, most obviously that this unfairly hurts people who are not able to work, and that many jobs are detrimental rather than helpful to people's mental and physical health, but I feel this is a better starting off point than where we were in 2010, where lots of unemployed people who were otherwise healthy were encouraged to register as disabled to fudge the numbers irrespective of the impact on their health."

"&gt; The funny part is that high black unemployment and income disparity happened more during the Obama years. Whereas, minorities have had much lower unemployment, higher wages and income during the short time Trump has been in office.

Have you got the numbers for that? Because it sounds like you're attributing the office Obama inherited to Obama and the office Trump inherited to Trump. So basically things could have been bad when Obama came to office so he worked to fix it and by the time Trump became president, things were pretty good.

Obviously if laws are on the books, enforcement should happen. If that's already the case enforcement isn't happening thoroughly.

1139	"Sorry, I stand corrected on one point: an additional gene causes the delay that makes calicos less red/black. From Wikipedia:

&gt;Pigment genes are expressed in melanocytes that migrate to the skin surface later in development. In bi-colored tortoiseshell cats, the melanocytes arrive relatively early, and the two cell types become intermingled, producing the characteristic brindled appearance consisting of an intimate mixture of orange and black cells, with occasional small diffuse spots of orange and black.

&gt;In tri-colored calico cats, a separate gene interacts developmentally with the coat color gene. This spotting gene produces white, unpigmented patches by delaying the migration of the melanocytes to the skin surface. There are a number of alleles of this gene that produce greater or lesser delays. The amount of white is artificially divided into mitted, bicolor, harlequin, and van, going from almost no white to almost completely white. In the extreme case, no melanocytes make it to the skin and the cat is entirely white (but not an albino). In intermediate cases, melanocyte migration is slowed, so that the pigment cells arrive late in development and have less time to intermingle. Observation of tri-color cats will show that, with a little white color, the orange and black patches become more defined, and with still more white, the patches become completely distinct. Each patch represents a clone of cells derived from one original cell in the early embryo."	"Whooooa there

Tortoiseshell/calico is a color you can only get from female chromosomes. 1 in 3,000 are infertile males, basically intersex kitties, with an extra sex chromosome.

Red (orange) cats are mainly male but female ones aren’t too uncommon. It’s one out of three potential outcomes, with calico being the most common."	aww	aww	1

More people bought Destiny 2 than Destiny 1. It launched on PC and at a time when current gen consoles had way more in total sales than back in 2014. The last gen market was always small and the last big DLC, rise of Iron, did not come out for it. Live events on old gen were turned off before this, its playerbase was dead and does not factor into the numbers I am telling you.

Destiny 2 had more initial players than D1, it now has half of destiny 1's year 3 base, 6 months in. 

&gt;No, Destiny still does, just like most MMO-likes do, if not all. 

Have you played it? Destiny 2 has barely any mechanics for player retention compared to D1. They took a huge gamble with the reward scheme and it is evident from actually playing how harmful that's been to 'the chase' that MMOs rely on to generate the feeling of progress and a desire for successive gaming sessions."

Statistics for the premier pvp mode, Trials of Osiris and its D2 analogue, Trials of the Nine.

Last week, Trials of the Nine was down to 55k participating accounts on all 3 platforms, down from a million on launch. Destiny 1 also had about a million players when HoW launched. At its very lowest, in the last month before Destiny 2 launched, it was triple D2's current numbers at 150k. 

**It took 3 years for D1 to shed 850k trials players. It took just over 6 months for D2 to shed 950.**

The playerbase for D2, which was close to D1 (again, *we have the API that gives us playercounts*) has haemorrhaged. Destiny 2 is not addicting compared to D1. This is the mistake that was originally mentioned.

1145	"My back feels amazing, thank god. Definitely wanna say that I'm not officially certified by any organization and all my research can be labelled ""opinion"" based. But I got an MRI and had a slight bulge in two discs, luckily it was minor enough that I had no impingement on the sciatic nerve. The docs (obviously) recommended taking 6-8 weeks off of training to let it rest, but what do they know about the gains right??

My personal approach was a lot of stretching, I will say that before the injury I had trouble touching the floor on a hamstring stretch, I slacked in that department. I went to physical therapy for 4 weeks where they gave me some heat and then a band and had me stretch for 40 minutes. So I stopped going back and carried on with stretching on my own, doing more static holds on lower back extensions as they still felt comfortable (no pain) and I found more exercises that gave my posterior chain a break. (My main leg day exercise because heavy lunges as i felt more comfortable bailing the weight if i were to ever feel pain).

I've read somewhere before about how the SI joint can hold an extreme amount of distributive force from even a small actual weight. I would love for someone who has more knowledge to intervene, but I've read that when doing a squat with a weight around 60lbs, your SI joint can feel a force equivalent to somewhere around 1600 pounds. That's a hell of a lot to play around with on your back. I just play it safe because I always had a crappy squat form and didn't feel the need to really fix it when I had other routes i could take.

They are usually worth a watch based on his concepts alone. But JJ isn't a finisher... he lays down pretty cool concepts, but never brings them home in a logical way, and certainly doesn't connect them to other movies in a logical way.

I just want people to stop thinking JJ is so amazing frankly. He's not. He's mediocre. Entertaining, but his unique skills with screenwriting and producing are equally met by his flaws with logic, connection, and closure."	"You said JJ wasn't involved with Lost beyond the first season, as if he can't be blamed for the lack of logic and resolution in the final seasons. I disagree. I think JJ absolutely can be blamed for setting up so many plotpoints that he never had clear-cut answers to. Good writers do not do this.

Great writers have an ending in mind, and work backwards. They may not have an exact ending in mind, but they certainly have a general idea. JJ doesn't work like that. JJ just throws stuff out that seems cool, and then runs with it. Then he hops ship on the project and everyone else is left to try to come up with some batshit answer to his plotpoints, which end up making ZERO sense. And then they get the blame for it.

JJ did it on Lost, and he also did it with TFA and TLJ, and I'm fairly certain he's going to do it on the final SW saga movie as well. And he's clearly shown he takes this approach on Cloverfield.

He's simply introduced the Multiverse plotline now so that he can get away with it. Anything flies now. Multiverse."	movies	movies	1

"	"TL;DR —

I really want to know - how is it that you came to the point where you genuinely felt indebted to and ashamed in front of God? Aside from the threat of hell, the fear of being rejected by people and being told over and over that you’re a miserable sinner in need of God’s grace, when you’re alone and 100% honest with yourself, do you believe you owe God an apology? 

***

I recently deconverted from Christianity after nearly three decades as a believer. I’m still searching though. While it seems most likely that humans created the idea of God (just like the millions of other gods), I want to know Him and all about Him if He really is Truth. I don’t want to be deceived. And I don’t want to deny reverence to whom it is due. 

I am honest and quick to apologize to people when I’ve offended or hurt them in any way. I am imperfect, but I don’t feel guilty about it. I just take responsibility and keep learning and growing. I love hearing truth and wisdom. It’s so refreshing!

While I strive to be humble, I also don’t automatically feel guilty just because someone says I should feel guilty (insert Sunday School teacher). I resist people’s attempts to manipulate - especially when I see them using shame as a tactic to further their own agenda. 

This happens frequently in Christian circles, during sermons and it’s in worship songs (now everyone stand and sing about what a broken, shameful, weak, lost, blind, unworthy wretch you are.) I go to church every week to be with my family, so I see it all the time. Makes me sad!

I’m reading Jesus Among Other Gods by Ravi Zacharias at the moment. I’m 75% finished. It’s been an interesting read, but I find myself going back to all my unanswered questions...

If God created humans and put us here on earth, why do we have to essentially apologize for being alive? Isn’t that His problem? He’s the father, we’re the children, right? Why do we have to ask him for forgiveness? Doesn’t it seem backwards? 

If God wants to have a personal relationship with his creation, why did he make us physical beings and remain invisible? And then why does he tell us to seek him? What parent would say to their newborn, “if you want to live, you better look for me or I will not nourish you or accept you” It’s like a cruel game of hide and seek. 

Again, why do you apologize to God? Why do you need his grace and forgiveness?

they might be but not all of them are.

board members are different, there are executive and non executive. non execs usually hold large shares in the business. executives are generally employees of a company, who are given managerial control over the company.

Why did you just remove a part of the sentence you quoted? I said it doesn't stay together if you want to access the build deck, not by itself. Check every review out there, Vic, PBusardo, you name it. They all mention it as a con. Please show me how you change your build with 3ml of liquid in your Hastur.

Yes, full disclosure, that is indeed my alt. I tend to separate vape related stuff from my main, sorry if that hurt your feelings.

Edit: Wow, downvoting me. Classy. Have an upvote.
"	"3 good choices that I own and can recommend:

1. Siren v2
 - Pros: Great build deck, 4,5ml capacity (24mm version), great airflow adjustment ring on the outside with many options
 - Cons: Big height

2. Hastur MTL
 - Pros: Similarly good build deck as the Siren v2, big capacity (3,5ml), included different coil airflow inlays
 - Cons: Need to empty tank before accessing build deck, top part doesn't stay together to hold the juice. Need to remove coil to change airflow inlay. ~~Airflow-ring on the outside isn't as specific as on the Siren and Berserker.~~

3. Berserker Mini 
 - Pros: Small form factor and as good flavour as the above
 - Cons: Might gurgle and temporarily leak when not bottom-filled (depends on wicking)

Bonus:

4. Kayfun Prime - don't need to get the expensive original. Just search for YFTK Prime around FastTech and others :)
 - Pros: Small form factor, beats any other MTL RTA imo flavour-wise, optional tank extender for 4,5ml and customizability with steel tanks. Easy as can be to wick. 
 - Cons: Very tiny build deck, not the easiest to build.

Sakura punched the ground, got hurt by Shin and saved by Sasuke, basically no fight at all.

Just because the filler has good animation or simply because you like the character doesn't mean the filler starts becoming a cannon feat. If it works that way i'm gonna start saying every single skill characters uses in Naruto Ninja Storm games is cannon just because they look super cool and have good animation or the anime fillers for the characters that i like is now a cannon feat, Filler is filler.

1185	"&gt; How do you figure the volume of the plastic going by the weight alone?

I'm not sure if this is a serious question, and if so, I'm not trying to talk down to you. But, this is a very basic question you've asked and I'm not sure how to answer it other than to be very simple about it. 

So here goes.

The answer to your question is that basically all materials have a known ""density"" that you can just look up. Water has one, copper has one, iron has another, packed and unpacked brown sugar have ones, etc. An easy way to measure this is to put a piece of something in water and see how much water it displaces.

Density is just the ratio of a substance's mass and the amount of space it takes up. Heavier things will have more mass in the same volume.

If you know the mass (given in the article as 80,000 tons) and you know the density (a number you can just look up, or measure yourself), you can find out the volume it would take up.

Volume = Mass / Density

In this case, some plastics are slightly above, some slightly below the density of water, (within 5-10%) so I just averaged them out to be the same density as water, which was good enough for a ballpark approximation.

Once I had that number sort of visualized, I picked the first thing that came to mind about the same scale, which was an apartment building, and then that was too variable so the next thing I thought of was a Walmart, which I looked up the average square footage of.

Ta da.

&gt; And you are aware of the depletion of global fish stocks caused by overfishing and pollution, right? It's not just one thing.

And you are aware I do not have some agenda I'm pursuing that I'm trying to convince people to support?

Yes, there are many problems with the ocean, I agree."	"&gt; The link shows it spanning an area approximately triple the size of France, so talking about it fitting inside a walmart to only 1 foot in depth presents an image of minor scale, relative to its actual scale.

I disagree. Both are factually correct:

 - The area is 3x the size of France.
 - The amount of plastic is equivalent to a Walmart packed 1 foot deep.

Neither of these discuss the impact of the plastic. Both are relevant. Again, if you took the same garbage and spread it out 2x as far, does that make the issues 2x as bad? Of course not, so the ""area"" isn't very relevant for scope, except to say what areas may be affected.

The goal of describing this isn't to accomplish one agenda or another. It's to be able to contextualize the facts.

&gt; You'd have to already understand and appreciate the shittiness of the situation to see why the analogy doesn't minimize the issue...which is rather problematic for an analogy.

I would have appreciated more discussion of the impact of the patch too, without sensationalizing it and fearmongering.

I have lots of questions about what's going to happen to all that plastic, where it goes, where it comes from, what we can do about it, to what degree can we improve it, how much will it cost, and is that the best way to spend our environmental conservation dollars."	science	science	1

1189	"If you want the lightest possible weight, the 400mm f5.6 will be the best option. It weighs only 2.75 lbs, focuses quickly, and is quite sharp. Pair it with an APSC body that has fast and accurate AF for best results (80D or 7D/7D mkii). If you look around long enough you can get one for $500 or less. Sigma and tamron have also released 100-400 lenses that weigh 2.5 to 3lbs as well which could be good choices. However, since they are new you will be paying full price for them. The AF won't be as fast as the 400 5.6 prime, but they have more flexibility than the prime so you'll have to chose the best option for you.

If you want reach, the canon 100-400 mkii takes a 1.4x tc way better than the 400 5.6. This will get you out to 560mm (896mm FF equivalent) for 1lb less than the 150-600. Your body will need to be an 80D or one of the 7Ds so you can autofocus at f8 with the tc on

If you have a ton of money burning a hole in your pocket there is the 400mm f4 DO IS mkii which takes the 1.4x and 2x tc's well, getting you out to 800mm at f8. With a crop camera, that is 1280mm FF equivalent. The lens weighs just a hair more than the 150-600, but it gets you to 800mm in a hand-holdable package.

I was sooooo unimpressed by that one. I also found all Hyundais to drive pretty boringly. The experience was not a good one. I'd never get one of those cars. 

The Civic to me was also unimpressive. You're right, the interior just felt very... immature. As did the exterior. Felt like a kid's car. The driving experience was also very underwhelming I thought. I actually had hyped myself up for months thinking ""Oh man! They finally brought back the Civic hatch! This is a sign. I'm getting that car!"". Then I drove it and came away thinking... no thanks.

I actually test drove the Mazda 3 in the 185 hp engine and thought it was pretty fun. Not as much fun as the GTI, WRX, or Mazdaspeed3, but much more fun than those I mentioned above.

I originally felt bad that I didn't get a manual and that I sacrificed horsepower even though I saved a few thousand dollars. Now though, I see how rarely I'm even able to stretch my GTI's legs. I would be even more frustrated if I had to drive a Mazdaspeed3 or WRX so tamely. I have a short commute on city streets and rarely take the interstate/highway. When I do take the highway, there's inevitably some asshole in the left most lane going the speed limit (my city is famous for that). Moreover, my city also has dumbass speed limits and plenty of cops to enforce them (and expensive tickets! Even 10 over is like $200). We literally have a beautiful, brand new stretch of wide open, 5 lane interstate that is almost never crowded. The speed limit is a frustrating 60mph and cops love to hang out there.

So yeah, I'd say I'm in the same boat with you. As long as I live where I live, I see no need to get anything more powerful than my GTI.

&gt; So following the same yearly rises and falls is decreasing? You compared June and December of 2017 and May of 2018. All of which match up with major life events such as Finals.

I compared June of this year and June of last year. Literally the exact same month, from year to year, it decreased by 15%. Honestly, what more could you ask for than that? I also chose shorter intervals just for more evidence but again, if you consider that those have to do with yearly trends, you can absolutely ignore them and still look at June to June.

&gt; And what's weird is you choose average players rather than peak

What on earth? You're just desperately trying everything here, honestly. I chose average because I thought that was more representative of the number of people regularly playing the game. The source we're using also thinks the same, that's why they list that number first and only provide gains/losses based on that number. To assume I'd use anything but the primary number provided by the source would be silly. But I certainly can:

June 2018 796,886 | June 2017 923,122 - 14% decrease.

And again, that's using the numbers you apparently would prefer I used. That's going from the same month to month across one year, so there's nothing like finals or anything like that to skew it. The decrease is almost the same.

&gt; All player bases are constantly shrinking after they hit their peak. You can safely claim that bullshit claim whenever you want for literally any game and then point to the awful metric you pointed to.

Again, so the game is shrinking. That's what I claimed. That's all I claimed.

Again, your response seems a bit unhinged when you say stuff like

&gt; All player bases are constantly shrinking after they hit their peak.

with 

&gt; it's not at all decreasing like you claim.

You do realize that shrinking and decrease are the same thing, right? So in once sentence you admit that it is shrinking and in the next you say it's not at all?

Edit: And just to clarify one last time, in case there's any confusion. I never said the game is dying. I said the OP was right when he said the player base is shrinking. In the last year, the player base has significantly decreased. That's the very definition of shrinking. If from year to year, a number consistently goes down, that's decreasing. From last year to this year, the game's player base has empirically decreased, and while I can't say whether that will have happened again in another year, I can say that for now that means exactly what I said. "	"I mean, if you do a search, you'll find frequent complaints about broken or long queues in more than just the last few months. So there can still be some correlation. Obviously, it's more than just one factor (smaller player base than a year ago, ranked role queues, coordinator problems, etc.) but it can potentially be a factor. So while it can also be argued against (that it's related, not that it's decreasing), I wouldn't say it's so completely off subject that it should be downvoted, and in fact I find the downvotes more akin to someone mentioning something that people don't want to hear and people's response to be covering their ears and repeating loudly ""LA LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU."""

1217	"&gt;I graduated with no debt 

You are in the serious minority.

&gt;business degree

Business degrees are fucking worthless. You want to learn business...**then do business**.

Don't know how to do business without learning from some halfass businessmen/academics in a classroom for $50k a year? **You most likely aren't going to be a very good businessman if this is the case.**

The money most people spend on a business degree would have been WAY better spent with trial and error. 4 (or 5) years and 6 figures in capital not spent on some halfassed education and instead utilized in the actual business world?

WAY more than what you ever learned achieving some business degree...and you could have succeeded and have a viable, successful business in those 4 years. Even if you failed, the experience is leaps and bounds more valuable than taking fucking exams.

We have the internet now. You can learn anything you want. **Who in the fuck thinks paying for some formal education is worth it anymore?**

I'll tell you who: Sheep that think it matters. Like it or not, a college degree gives you status in this shallow world. This is directly to the benefit to these universities that continually price gouge students for insane fees.

Do you people not see this? Are the social brownie points worth *that* much to you?

College was a good thing years ago. It was a point in time where people get away from home and their parents and did something new. You learned some stuff, but more than that...you developed who you were. The experience was relatively inexpensive....and the average student could have paid their full tuition with a summer job.

It made sense then.

But at $30k+ a year in debt, potentially 6 figures upon graduation, you have to ask yourself, ""Am I getting good use from this time and money?""

In the majority of cases, I would say absolutely not.

We're all holding the collective intelligence of humanity in our pockets...for free. Fucking use it.
"	"Give 6 months to any determined person in your field and they could replicate your 4 wasted years.

Business isn't astrophysics. It's way more art than hard science, so to speak. The concepts are basic. You can build on concepts through experience.

Businessmen connect dots. Businessmen do not need to be experts in every aspect of every business they are engaged in. They identify markets and demand. **They build successful teams.** Ask anyone that has owned any successful business for any length of time, they will say the same. Team building, knowing who you can trust and not trust and other valuable lessons are ONLY learned by experience.

You can spout off obscure terms related to YOUR field all day long...it will do you absolutely no good if you don't have a knack for basic business concepts.

I suppose going to school is effective in people that lack the ability to learn independently.

But if you can't learn independently in the business world, you're fucked before you even start.

If you're aiming for medicrity...I suppose a degree can help you find a cubicle and 401k. Because that's what most business majors find after graduation."	Economics	Economics	1

They are related by the very definition of order. From Wikipedia:

&gt;The axioms for a non-strict partial order state that the relation ≤ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. That is, for all a, b, and c in P, it must satisfy:

&gt;* *a* ≤ *a* (reflexivity: every element is related to itself).

&gt;* if *a* ≤ *b* and *b* ≤ *a*, then *a* = *b* (antisymmetry: two distinct elements cannot be related in both directions).

&gt;* if *a* ≤ *b* and *b* ≤ *c*, then *a* ≤ *c* (transitivity: if a first element is related to a second element, and, in turn, that element is related to a third element, then the first element is related to the third element).

And then you define *a* &lt; *b* as *a* ≤ *b* ∧ *a* ≠ *b*.

&gt; This is not something that was ever guaranteed by C++ initially, but people knew they could assume that, and things went on.

Floats had no total order from the very beginning, even in C. So it shouldn't have been unexpected. No one who hasn't slept their way through the intro class on C++ would assume that always `(a == b || a &lt; b || a &gt; b)`

I’m not a trained sex counselor but I did a brief stint in my university peer health education group and I’ve studied sex and sexuality, and I’m an anonymous person on the internet you can message without judgement.

1241	"Why? From a story perspective, only Horde know whats going on in Uldir and are going in. Gameplay wise, it's far easier to have one raid that both factions can access over trying to design and build two faction specific raids for a raid tier.

This is no different then the Horde having no clue as to what's going on in the dungeons on Kul'tiras or the Alliance having the same issue with the dungeons on Zandalar."	Nope. You just aren't looking at the big picture. Each potion use by a DPS boosts their damage by around 1%. In a standard mythic raid team, there are 14 DPS. This translates to about a 14% boost in overall raid DPS if everyone pre-pots just before the pull. This can make the difference between a phase shift that lets your raid avoid a nasty mechanic and having to eat said mechnic.	wow	wow	1

1250	"That’s not an urban myth.

For “general” code, reducing instruction cache pressure is going to result in better performance.

For specific cases, say an audio/video encoder, it may be faster to have the additional inlining and loop unrolling. Or it might not. You have to benchmark your specific usage.

Modern processors do a really good job with branch prediction, so loop unrolling, for example, is a lot less effective than reducing instruction cache load.

Again, it depends entirely on the specific case, so, as a general rule, you don’t want widespread inlining and unrolling. 

EDIT: usually if you want to enable unrolling or something for a block of code, you can just use a pragma or whatever for your compiler for specific sections of code or place that code in a separate build module. But wholesale enabling of all optimization’s across the entire codebase is usually a bad idea."	"Do you man. You’ve been provided with plenty of counter points. 

If it works for you, awesome. No one is saying it doesn’t work for you. I don’t have your system in front of me and I haven’t run benchmarks on it.

What is the best evidence-based practice for that health problem?

If you want to know how to improve a public safety/public health crisis, I'd suggest talking to the people who have spent their lives training to study that problem. Look at the work of people who use the scientific method to gather and analyze data, and study related problems in depth for years. What evidence exists that one type of policy or another can help prevent deaths and injuries? What evidence do we have for or against various proposed policy changes? 

Researchers create the knowledge that drives how people are trained to do jobs like mine. Same goes for people in other fields."

1257	"As an ex-Christian, the best way I can describe the whole ""talking to God"" thing (if it's not actually schizophrenia or hallucinations, which honestly it rarely is) is that it's more like hearing your own thoughts, like the voice in your head when you read. It doesn't quite sound like you but it's in your head.

Now I see it more like my subconscious mind or even parts of my conscious mind giving myself advice (""everything will be ok"" etc etc. I think everyone experiences this) but Christians would assign this voice to God because they're taught that humans are flawed and can't trust their own minds, or maybe they just want to think it's God.

In terms of how to deal with someone who thinks that it's God speaking and that's how they ""know,"" there's honestly no good solution. There's no way to really convince them without attempting to unravel their entire mindset around religion, which is very, very difficult to do.

It's usually best to just smile and nod or ask questions to clarify (what did you hear? Why do you think that? Etc.). I used to give the same excuse (I've met him!!) until I knew better, so I know that arguments and facts don't always work."	"Yeah, it's nuts. The thing about it is that the times you ""hear him"" the most are times when you're low, depressed, struggling etc. You just want hope. There is something comforting in thinking that someone ""bigger"" than you has a plan and has your back. Looking at it now I think I probably wanted it to be ""him"" because my life was so messed up. That's why most people convert to Christianity when they're in a rough patch in life. It becomes a lot easier to believe in that stuff when you have no other options. You don't really see healthy, thriving people or billionaires converting en masse, right? It's usually the suffering ones who want to believe that someone will come and help them out of their mess."	atheism	atheism	1

The problem is software patents are granted for every frivolous little thing, and so it's impossible to create anything with software at this point without probably violating dozens or maybe hundreds of patents.  If software patents are going to continue to exist, they should be reserved only for significant and highly unique inventions. Right now they grant anyone a patent for pretty much anything anyone writes with software."	"Just in case anyone else isn't aware of what he actually did and didn't say, these articles always just say that he said the n-word and don't mention the context.

Now, he said it during a business call, and it's inappropriate and awkward that he used the word at all.  But that just means he's a little naive and clueless, but this may be just a bit of an overreaction to what he actually said.

I also don't like the guy and wouldn't be surprised if he's a racist.  But still, I do find the reaction to this particular event to be way over the top and the misleading articles about it that provide no context are most of the source of the confusion and resulting outrage."	business	business	1

But I feel as though with coming out as being a major theme in the album with songs like Garden Shed just shows his seriousness with that kind of situation. I feel as he has, or possibly still is, battling with his sexuality and wanted an album that people who are going through similar problems, such as the fear of coming out or exploring their sexuality, to be more confident with their choices and who they are and to not give a fuck about what others think. I think the whole album is based around finding himself but in the process making songs anyone can relate to. Ex: being bored, not having time, having worldly possessions but still feeling empty, struggling w sexuality; all of these are shown throughout the album, however, materialism probably being the largest and most prominent in the album.

Make it easier for you. The US is a massive nation consisting of many different states. Quit thinking of the US as a single nation, it is closer to the European Union than a singular country, it is a federal union of states. Each state has its own data. Compare states to states and countries to states, or the EU to the USA.

When you compare the United States to the entire European Union, the rate is 3.0 per 100k in the EU and 5.35 in the USA. You have to compare the land size, number of deaths AND attempted murder. Why? the USA is 3.797 million square miles, the EU is only 1.708 million square miles. You would have to compare the distance from a hospital and loss of life due to the time it takes to get healthcare, alongside a hundred other factors for an accurate comparison that could even come close to proving the issue is due to guns.

A little common sense will tell you that comparing statistics from one single metric without comparing other extremely pertinent details will result in absolutely useless data, and the basic impossibility of even fielding that amount of data into a usable format for analysis will be impossible until technology advances and funding is available for such a study. "	"It also seems to me that your source is including 9/11 in with intentional homicide, and does not provide direct sources for the data. Because I can't compare its reporting to the raw data to ensure accuracy, I'm a little skeptical, though indexmundi is fairly and generally pretty accurate. 

Edit: Aaaand there is only one data point for the EU homicide data on indexmundi, and I can't find that same data on the UNODC site/database. 

Either way, this single metric cannot be the sole source for proving that guns are the cause of homicide rates being higher."	offbeat	offbeat	1

About 5 years ago I took a basic rider course and got my motorcycle endorsement and couldn’t wait to get on a bike. I bought a couple of ninja 250’s in succession- both of which I totaled in the first *two weeks* of having them. The first one slid out on me when I hit some gravel I didn’t see in a relatively low speed turn, and the second one I rear ended a driver who cut me off. Though I don’t consider myself a reckless rider or someone who takes risks, my reaction time and hazard recognition wasn’t fast enough and I need to work on that.

Though I thankfully walked away with no injury from either accident, they have both left me significantly shaken and nervous about getting back at it, even after 5 years. The passion and excitement for riding is still definitely there in full force, and I’ve been toying with the idea of getting another beginner bike (ninja 300/650, FZR 600, CBR 300/500, etc.) with the expectation that I would take another MSF course focused on safe street skill building. I’m wondering if- given my track record- this is something you would advise against.

There's the problem of major characters doing arbitrary things just so the plot can progress (Anduin bringing only 4 people to confront Sylvannas and letting her monologue them to death)  There's the problem that the alliance had no idea why they were even in Uldir, and I suspect the Horde are going to have a similiar ""what the hell is any of this?"" when we get to a raid centered around the alliance storyline. 

There's the problem that ALL the atrocities and war crimes a faction does are never seen by the actual faction.

 These are all story complaints, and adding a third storyline will make everything else even less polished. 

I liked the stories they are telling too and enjoyed leveling, but they do have a lot of issues that would only get worse if they had to think of even more plotlines to satisfy a third faction.

They couldn't have just started digging through his drawers for the bullet casings, but if there was drug evidence out in plain view, they could have amended their warrant to search beyond the initial scene for evidence related to the drugs found. Then they could have been more invasive in their search. Obviously a shooting occurred so they'd need authorization from someone, since he was deceased and unable to approve, to process the scene and collect the medical bandages and casings to link to the shooting. I can almost bet that's what happened. It has no bearing on the shooting itself really, but even though it's just weed it is still a crime and they had to process it. I'm sure the evidence for the warrant was discussed to appear transparent, but it was clearly and probably justifiably pervieved as smearing.

My point is more that when women are perceived to be incapable to rape, or when being raped by a woman is still considered a ""lucky"" think for the guy, it is much harder to get belief from people.

Your regard to schools and spending is taken from a few Google searches or reddit posts, as your words amply reflect.

The teachers Kentucky are a piece of a far larger issue reflecting state-wide pensions and local politicians being politicians. The moronic decision to allow a religious theme park tax breaks to help the commonwealth was a sign to Kentuckians who voted blindly. 

&gt;    The budget passed by the Kentucky legislature on Monday night would increase per-pupil student funding to $4,000, up from the current $3,981. But that's still below pre-recession levels once adjusted for inflation.

Note the above figure, Annie, and consider how that reflects a state’s worth of educators. It is obvious you are not an educator, as teachers all over are NOT simply trying to get money for themselves. 

It is per-student-funding, Annie. Teachers paying for classroom materials out of their own pocket may be alright by you, but THAT type of lethargic attentiveness is why this problem exists currently. Do you pay to work at your job? Can you afford to pay to work at your job? Teachers cannot - but do so anyhow. In Shelby County, Kentucky I personally know teachers who have spent over a thousand dollars per semester.   

Please Annie, share where you acquired your regard to teachers not caring about their fellow pensioners? And, it seems you know the sheer volume of state pensioners in Kentucky? It may behoove you to read a little before helping yourself appear ignorant unnecessarily.

So....per-student-funding. 

$3,981 up to $4,000....that is a lot per student, right?
Well..

&gt;    U.S. states' education spending averaged $10,700 per pupil in 2013, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but that average masked a wide variation, ranging from $6,555 per pupil in Utah to $19,818 in New York.

Note that said 2013.

Think about it for a second. Maybe there's someone who doesn't say ""I'm a teacher"". But they go to work at the school everyday, they lead classrooms, they grade papers. When the students say ""teacher"", he turns and give them attention. He never corrects them. He might never call himself ""teacher"", but says he's an educator, he's sent by the principle. The school pays him. He parks in the teacher's spots in the parking lot. He eats in the teacher's lounge and talks to the other teachers. Say some student then says ""you know, I've never heard him call himself a teacher explicitly. I'm going to just refuse to listen to instructions, stop doing my homework and when I get a failing grade, I'll just claim that he never called him a teacher explicitly."" The other students would think that he's absolutely nuts. 

Jesus may never say ""hey everyone, just wanted to let the cat out of the bag: I'm God"" but the reason when he said ""before Abraham was, I AM"" made the Jews of his time so angry is because they knew he was referring to Yahweh's self-title given when he spoke to Moses from the burning bush. He forgave sins. He said he was the Lord of the Sabbath. He received worship. He says he's to be prayed to. He says that all judgment is given to him. That he's one with the Father. We've all quoted these verses from the Gospels, or Injil. You seem to accept those writings, but I could be very mistaken in my reading of you here.

1300	"&gt; I think you are vastly overestimating the financial savings from not needing a physical location.

Could be, and it depends on the course. But renting a lecture hall for an intro psyche class of 300 students is expensive. It does come from within the university, so as you say it becomes more difficult to trace costs at that point.

But then you're also looking at maintenance costs for the building which you no longer need as often.

I disagree about the TA vs. cost of renting space argument because of those points. Even if you pay a TA 100$ an hour, your space rental will cost more than that. In the end it all comes down to what the exact numbers are, which I can only give anecdotes for, but I definitely don't think a university would offer online courses if it were less profitable for them than traditional classes."	Right, but it's less overall cost for the university because they're not paying for lecture hall space, and enrollment can go up because there's no limitation.

1303	"This question was addressed to Christians. I'm replying on the basis that the Q'uran agrees that the Injil (or Gospels) are inspired according to Surah 5:68—Say: ""O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord.""

The Gospel of John is not dated 100 years after Jesus, critical scholars date it 60 years later (90 AD). There are many good reasons to believe that John's Gospel can actually be dated before the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, as it's author is very familiar with the the city and correctly describes the Pool of Bethesda, which archaeology has since confirmed it's existence. (John 5)

But we can certainly date the deity of Christ sooner than the Gospel of John. That deity of Christ is mentioned in the early creeds and psalms of the church, like in Philippians 2 and Romans 10:9-13. They quoted verses from the Old Testament normally ascribed to Yahweh and ascribed them to Jesus (Joel 2:32, Romans 10:13 for example). Paul said the Gospel he preached was confirmed by the Gospel that James, John and Peter preached from the beginning (Galatians 2). James was Jesus' brother, and Peter denied Christ only to become one of his most boldest proclaimers. They did this based on their eyewitness to the resurrection (creed dated from 33-38 AD from 1 Cor 15:3-7, sermon summaries in Acts 2, 10, 13, etc) 

There's a lot more I can unpack here, but Jesus' worship came and belief in his deity came from the earliest days of the church, it wasn't something that evolved over time. And the belief came from his resurrection, and there are reasons to believe his statements in the Gospels even excluding John's Gospel as that Jesus saw himself as the unique Son of God who would judge the nations. He forgave sins and claimed authority over the Sabbath (Mark 2) and people's eternal destinies (Luke 12:8–9). 

So for the Muslim (I'm not asking the atheists or agnostics here, that's another debate), I want to know why Allah deceived Jesus's own followers into thinking he was crucified when he was not really crucified, and why he allowed his followers to be deceived into believing and proclaiming his resurrection and give their lives for it if it never happened.

The few basic functions of a government are to define and defend property rights, defend against foreign aggression, protect its citizens against each other, and adjudicate disputes, within its border. If it isn't allowed to assume a border, the necessary qualifier for all those functions would vanish.

&gt;As long as the immigrants privately pay for their housing and support, then I don't really have a problem with it.

Neither do I have a problem with it. But how would you achieve this ideal? It's easy to just state an ideal. What exactly are the practical ways you have to move toward the best approximation that minimizes coercion on the citizens in the meantime? Also note that there necessarily is an order of operation.

I support your ideal. But I have to disagree with your approximation.

&amp;#x200B;"	"If you want the rich guy to invest in housing, that just means he doesn't invest or invests not as much in something else. How do you know which way is the best investment? You may feel comfortable chanting for something that helps the people in your immediate field of vision, but you just don't seem to care for something bad that happens elsewhere out of your sight. If you take from the rich guy to invest in housing, some people out there whom you don't even see, would lose their jobs, their wages, or their opportunity for jobs or higher wages.

The way people view wealth as a stack of food/water/construction material/etc. hidden in a warehouse somewhere that could be used for good is extremely misinformed and misleading. I assure you that billionaires don't have stacks of concrete material hidden somewhere. Less than 5% of GDP is from raw material. Most of the wealth comes from creative activities. Billionaires don't have a stack of billions of cash. They have enterprises that enable people to work, to produce, and to exchange.

Think about it. How much does a billionaire actually spend on himself (houses, cars, airplanes, etc.) compared to what he produces for other people?

I don't disagree with taxation. But the problem we have today is not because the government doesn't tax or spend enough. It's completely the opposite."	Libertarian	Libertarian	1

If you're not in PPR, I can understand not wanting to start him, and Kenny Golladay is certainly a worthy replacement.	"Full PPR, 12 teams. I have a tough decision to make this week with 4 startable WR2s on my team after they all performed mostly above expectations this week.

Enunwa @ CLE

Cooper @ MIA

Hogan @ DET

Cole @ TEN

Honestly, I was feeling pretty great about my golden-waiver-goose Enunwa after the morning slate of games. 7rec for 90+ yards is awesome to have any day. And then Cooper, Hogan, and Cole all outscored him. Granted, Enunwa was wide open in the endzone and Darnold missed him, and he would have easily had the highest score had that touchdown been converted. Cole looked flat out electric against the Pats, Cooper (however frustrating) is still the receiver to own in what should be a solid offense and Hogan has Brady tossing him dimes.

As far as downsides, I feel if Fournette plays, Cole's ceiling is capped significantly, which is a shame, because he's a damn playmaker. To be honest I'm hoping Hogan has a bonkers game this week so I can trade him with Edelman returning; Hogan's targets will diminish some in the coming weeks. Cooper feels like he's gonna bust any given week, but he's possibly the most talented of the receivers that I have with the highest upside, and I feel like Enunwa is possibly capped by uncertain QB play; jury is still out on Darnold who had a solid debut but fell back to earth this week.

I still think I'm leaning Enunwa overall simply for guaranteed volume but some of these matchups are pretty sweet. Alternatively, I could add one of them into the FLEX spot where Drake currently sits (vs. OAK). But I'd like to get some advice."	fantasyfootball	fantasyfootball	1

That said, it's disingenuous to say ""I don't know"" in domains that are both momentous and inevitable (to borrow William James).

I don't know whether the human race will survive another generation, but I must act as if it will survive another million years (and so treat the environment a certain way, invest in education, etc.) I must act with 100% confidence that the human race will not be extinct soon, even though I only believe this with 10-15% confidence (after reading John Leslie's damned book, End of the World.)

You may not know if the miracles experienced by millions of people around the world, today and in the past, represent anything potentially interesting about the world... but you must act.

1330	"&gt; the supply curve for each school has flatter plateaus that can only be reached with capital expenditure (like a set of stairs)

But that wouldn't hold in aggregate; aggregate supply would be smooth, yes individually a school performing a large capital spend (say, constructing more classrooms and hiring faculty) is large and not smooth; but on a national scale you can't assume a non-smooth curve, as there are many school's individual curves aggregated together; and the different schools are all at different levels of capacity and have the ""steps"" of capital spend at different points. So what you're describing may hold for a single school's supply curve, but I wouldn't project that shape on the aggregate.

For your demand curve &amp; price discussion; the context here is tax ~~rebates~~ deductions; not student loans. I admit the two factors play different roles, but the case here is tax exemptions on education, not the larger student loan &amp; financing debate (where direct subsidies &amp; such come into play). Multiple mechanisms in play simultaneously; but let's not diverge from arguments that tax deductions can have market corrective influence with the fact that other policies can also have distortion effects... that's more than I'm willing to support, this is a case where education expenditures (not in the form of loans) can reduce income tax burdens.

edit for word choice and spelling."	"Well, the original post cites mortgage as a ""bad""; I'll leave that as enough of an example.

Education and relocation expenses are candidates for the ""good"". Education has spillover effects; individuals left to bear the full cost would under-consume. This is skewed in the US however, since so much education is subsidized through means other than income taxation. Relocation also has societal benefits and externalities realized beyond the individual. A more mobile workforce is more flexible; as well it allows for easier adaptation to geographical changes. But again, this particular case is undercut by simultaneously subsidizing individuals to purchase homes at leverage (and we're back to the mortgage interest deduction).

There are other candidates: charitable donations, job search costs, &amp; energy tax credit come to mind. Basically any case with spillover effects and positive externalities. 

But I'll openly admit not all attempts at positive reinforcement have the intended consequences... Tax free health insurance would be the prime example of good intentions leading to poor market outcomes."	Economics	Economics	1

"The taxes that an oil company pays are the price and arguably the value of the public goods and services the oil company benefits from and even relies on for its existence, as you are no doubt aware.

When pollution ruins the environment and there is no tax or pollution fund in place to pay for the pollution damages once again it is the community separate from the oil industry that pays the costs, again the as you say third party, paying for the benefit of the oil industry.

Sleep deprivation is easier when you’re 22 than when you’re 35 (so I’m told anyway, I’m actually only 28 now). Having kids in my early 20s also means I’ll be early 40s when both my kids are in college. 

Cons- we had no money, no stability, neither of us had finished school, he had a stable job but we were living paycheck to paycheck and still needed help from our parents. We were the second of our friends to have a kid, and there was a pretty big disconnect with some of our friends after our first son was born. A couple of them are now former friends because they openly looked down on us for becoming parents at 22. I also dealt with some condescension from other people because I look even younger than I am, so there’s definitely some stigma that comes with having kids before 25. 

But all those cons, forced us to grow a thicker skin and learn to advocate harder for ourselves and our kids. Because people already expected us to fail before our first son was even born, and now that we’ve been successful in raising our kids AND advancing ourselves and being generally responsible, all the cons are no longer issues. We also understand how lucky we are that our parents were able to help us with some things, because it would’ve been even harder without them. 

I have zero regrets and would do it all again in a heartbeat, because having my kids in my early 20s changed my life for the better. "	I did!

1. Music is to be aggressively loud Indian EDM

2. If clients request that you lower the volume, pretend not to understand. 

3. When doing leg press, ensure that clients retract their legs no more than 15 degrees from straight, utilising a bouncing motion at the bottom. 

4. The pull-up bar is for display purposes only. 

5. Please hang your spare towels on other clients’ barbells: they will appreciate the extra weight. 

6. On entering the gym, greet and shake hands with all the other clients. (This is actually quite sweet).

7. Use the Smith Machine wherever possible. If it’s not possible, try harder. 

8. Clients should be aware that preening time on the treadmill alongside the mirror is limited to 15 mins per customer. 

9. An exciting accessory exercise you may not be familiar with is Hunt The Paired Dumb Bell. It may surprise you how cleverly it can be hidden. "	I am!

Remember what happened with Prophet Noah pbuh and his son, Prophet Abraham pbuh and his father, and remember how severely Allah warns Prophet Muhammad pbuh.	"&gt; A jar of pennies has an even or an odd number of pennies, however:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Do I believe it's even? No.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I believe it's odd? No.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Theists are claiming the jar has an even number of pennies and atheists say we do not believe their claim. It is up to the theist to demonstrate his claim that there is in fact an even number of pennies.

Your example (and some others gave similar examples) is irrelevant as it is.

Let us make it relevant:

Two missing elements in your example are as follows:

1. Burden of proof in an example corresponding to God must relate to an consequence. If there is 0 implication of being right or wrong, we cannot speak of burden of proof. In case of God, there are many claimed consequences of being right or wrong, like hell, being ungrateful, irrational for not seeing possible evidences... If the claim of God is true, then those consequences also will be true. If there is no consequence of being right or wrong, there will be no real burden of anything.

2. The proofs or evidences must be accessible. If these are not accessible, then we cannot talk of the burden of proof, since it will never be known whether what is proven is true or not.

So;

Suppose that you are in a contest as a team of two partners.

The question is: Is the number of pennies in the jar in front of each of you odd or even? (Let us omit the weight of the jar for simplicity, and assume that you cannot count the pennies, but there are some data by which you can find the answer or not.) There are three buttons for each of you: 1. Odd 2. Even 3. No evidence seen/no answer/ (not convinced). At that stage, if both of you give the correct answer you get USD10.000, if one gives correct and the other wrong answer, you get 1.000, if one gives correct answer, the other is unconvinced, you get 2.000. If both gives ""no evidence"", then you get 200. If none gives correct answer, then you get nothing. (The amounts are total for the team, and you share the result among you.)

Each of you have exactly same jar, same amount of pennies, and same mechanism.

You start, and your friend finds the answer first. After a while he presses the ""odd"" button and says, ""It is odd, press that button"". You ask why? He says, ""because I discovered evidence for a mechanism where for any odd number of pennies, the electrical circuit is closed and the lamp is on. And accordingly when I put the jar on the mechanism, the lamp is on. So press also the ""Odd"" button. You say, ""I am not convinced"". He says ""Why not, do what I did and you will see""? You say ""You did not fulfill your burden of proof, you came with a claim, so you have to convince me, and I am not convinced and I do not have the burden of proof to show you the opposite, and I will just press 'not convinced button' and this button does not require any burden of proof.""

(In a second scenario, you agree to look at his evidence, but you are not convinced, and you say ""I am not convinced that there is an evidence for your claim, so I will press the unconvinced button"", he says ""prove me that my evidence is invalid, so that I also press that button instead of pressing the wrong button"". Though you have time, you say ""I make no claim, so I do not have any burden of proof, and I do not need to explain anything.""

Atheists' position is very similar to the second person in this adjusted example rather than your initial example."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

Can theists meet the burden of proof if they claim no ~~gods~~ teapot  exist?

It's just a teapot - allbeit in space. And yet, can anyone truly claim to ""prove"" that no such teapot exists?.

I mean, that’s really not answering my question. You could find her personally unattractive and still be jealous.

&gt;And a lot of guys I’ve hooked up with were hotter than my BF so it’s really not a problem.

Come on, the fact that added a competitive slant to this that no one asked for is another indicator of jealousy.

&gt;I guess it’s probably the reality of having a facs to our to the person and probably why my BF doesn’t want to meet my guy.

That’s fair. In this case, you’re going to have to talk to him about discovering this is a new boundary for you, and see how he responds. I only harp on the jealousy because if you are, then being in an open relationship may not be the best for you. If you’re not, then would you wan to continue the open relationship with this boundary (not meeting other partners) or close the relationship?"	"&gt;It’s just the idea that the girl he picked to be his FWB is not what I expected at all.

I pretty much stopped dead on MP after I realised that I was only playing LoL out of routine, and that I was not having fun being around salty internet strangers all the time.

It's only been a few days, but I've already had dozens of moments where the pressure is on par with being 1 hit away from killing Darkeater Midir in DS3. Also I had a fantastic moment yesterday where I had to run away from an early game firefight, and was sitting in a small room with shotgun for probably 2 minutes watching the door. After everything had calmed down, I realised that a guy had been crouched in a bathtub behind me with no weapons the entire time. We just nodded at each other and I left without shooting him.

1413	"You're advocating for continued existence of law enforcement and courts, with no surefire way to pay for it. You're saying everyone will simply volunteer to pay for it because it will serve them, but that's just not true. Many people will weasel out of paying for it as much as possible, while those who pay the most for the system will have the greatest influence over it. 

For absolutely every single government system that is funded by voluntary means, the individuals that put the most into it will have the most power over it. Once they capture the system, they will be able to bend it to their will if they so desire. They can stack the courts with favorable judges, or cops that know where their bread is buttered. They can stack the healthcare system to extort individuals, they can be anti-competitive to other systems, and if they can afford that, they can probably afford to pay for judicial favor in the justice system. 

These potential issues that I'm listing, they currently exist to some extent, but the reason they exist is not the mandatory government costs (meaning taxes), they exist because of the voluntary ones. Nobody forces you to contribute anything to a politician's campaign. But the individuals that do absolutely own the government. That's how they get stadiums, tax breaks, and regulations which completely benefit them at the expense of competitors and consumers. I would hate for this sort of thing to extend to every government funded program or service. 

I find it incredibly frustrating that these issues exist today, but the thing is that if we made the system only about voluntarily paying in, then there's nothing that could challenge your influence besides an equal amount of money. With voting, (something that would also be financially crippled under a system of voluntary funding) you give citizens the power to challenge the money with their votes. Unfortunately, with the advancement of media, money influences that quite effectively as well, but it still gives is some kind of check. 

It's funny that you would never wish to live under a benevolent autocrat, but fail to realize that under your system you would ideally be living under a bunch of benevolent oligarchs. You would hope that the rich who have enough money to make these systems work would uphold and them and defend them, rather than use their power to destroy them and drain everyone else.

Even if you created an organization and pooled a bunch of your money, now you have corporate governance to deal with, which is just a smaller form of government. And if as soon as this organization chooses to spend it's money on something you don't like, you take your money out, then the organization is doomed from the start because there's no way they will be able to please all the individuals who paid in. Someone will always be taking their money out. So if they have to battle against an oligarch who has a similar amount of money, he will crush the org because he doesn't have voters to deal with, his decision is the only one that matters. 

Therefore, those with enormous sums of money have an advantage over organizations which pool their money, and you have to just pray that those individuals are benevolent enough not to financially enslave you. 

You can't get away from these people because there are systems in your life that you need to survive, like the justice system, like a healthcare system, like an environmental safety agency, like a food and drug safety agency. I mean if you think you can live without those things, then please go do that! There are plenty of places where you can go do that and pay little to no tax! But if you want to live in society then you can't live without those systems. 

Which is why a benevolent autocrat is always better then a bunch of benevolent oligarchs. Those in power will dictate how huge portions of your life goes regardless, because they will control those systems which you cannot live without unless you basically become a hermit. 

A benevolent oligarchy is even harder to establish than a benevolent autocrat because you have more people, therefore more variables. In both of those situations, we the people don't have a say. Which is why democracy is the only way to do it, but if we do not pay into the government, then only those with enormous sums of money will have power. The voice of the people will have no power. The money we put in allows for enforcement of the things we voted for, and if we are allowed to just pull our money voluntarily, then we are crippling our power vs. the oligarchy. "	"The people with the money and the influence end up looking after their own interests and aim to exact change through incremental approaches which do not massively threaten them. Is it any surprise? 

This will have to continue until the system becomes untenable and something breaks. At that time there will be chaos and mass unrest of some sort, whether it be a war, or riots, or simply mass unemployment that leads to an enormous spike in crime. "	Economics	Economics	1

I'm not trying to imply that there aren't any opportunities for you to branch out and meet new people your age, but by getting married and having kids so young you gave up the typical early-twenties experience. People your age are most likely not doing the same things you're doing and don't have the same responsibilities. 	Yeah you're being unreasonable asking him to cut out his best friend.

More talent means better hockey for you to watch. 	They tried for a bit, but there were a few things that prevented them from developing chemistry. The first is that Crosby and Kessel both like to control the puck. They both like to hold it going over the line and while cycling. Putting them together prevents one or both of them from being able to control play the way they like. The other thing is that Crosby generally just builds better chemistry with a LW. He plays off his backhand a lot, which is going to give the puck to a LW more often than not, whether it's off a pass or rebound. Looking at guys he's had good chemistry with in the past is a long list of LWs: Sheary, Neal, Kunitz, Dupuis, Marchand (in international play), etc. Hornqvist is a pretty good RW match for Crosby because he crashes the net to try and knock in some greasy goals. That obviously isn't the type of player that Kessel is. 	hockey	hockey	1

In addition, I'd make sure that you cover usage rights. Few photographers will assign copyright, but some will allow unlimited usage for any purpose. If you might decide that you want to use them on t-shirts or in books, or something else later, that is important.

Get on the same page in terms not just of price but in workflow. Can you help select which images get edited? How many can you expect to be edited? How long a turn around time do you get? Are the images watermarked? What resolution and what format are they delivered in? What else can the photographer use the images for? (For example, I just shot an album cover and got explicit permission to use the images to promote my photography or in my artwork)."	photography	photography	1
1432	The transition from juvenile to sexually-mature adult is triggered by an environmental factor (factors?), so all the mayflies in a given area become sexually mature at the exact same time. The advantage there should be obvious; then they only survive for a short time because that's all that is necessary. Mayflies that didn't spend energy growing a digestive system for the imago stage could spend that energy on reproductive activities, and since they are very likely to find mates in the hours before they starve, emphasizing reproduction at the cost of longer-term survival produces more/better offspring from shorter-lived individuals.

1441	"&gt;... because they're free for the people who buy the Arcade Edition

are you purposely being dumb?

The ""Arcade edition"" patch is free for all existing users of SF5. So if i go to gamestop and buy a used copy of sf5 for **10-15** bucks i can just install the arcade edition patch **for free**.

if i bought sf5 **2 years ago** i get the arcade edition patch **FOR FREE**.

the main reason why the arcade edition is **40 dollars** is because it comes bundled with all dlc characters from season 1 and 2.  the season passes for both seasons cost **20 dollars each**.

so effectively the ""Arcade edition"" is just a bundle that contains the original game and the 2 season passes. people who buy the 40 dollar Arcade edition are not getting these characters ""for free"". they are paying for it.

The ""Arcade Edition"" **patch** and the dlc characters from season 1 and 2 are completely different things. 

the ""Arcade Edition"" **patch** is an update to existing sf5 that contains new modes and balance changes.  DLC characters are extra characters that you can buy with real money or fight money.

Sure there is sense in it. Interest wanes over time. Sometimes the genre needs to be reimagined to bring back people and an expansion isn't going to do it.

Edit: Not saying a card game is likely, just that there is a reason behind competing with oneself"	"Yeah I don't blame you. I do think them straight up announcing it is a new game is significant though, and typically when Blizzard talks about their game development history, you always hear they started working on it immediately after releasing the previous iteration with a very small team initially. This can happen even when expansions are still in the works for the previous game.

Whatever they have is very likely to have 4\+ years of work on it, but with Overwatch release a couple years ago, the Diablo team probably grew very large. Also, D3 was announced in June, not at Blizzcon, we could even see something very soon, but that is wishful thinking.

I wouldn't be too surprised though if they announce a D2 remaster, people get hyped, but then at the end of the panel, they drop the D4 announcement. D2 remaster to hold people over until the actual release of D4 would be very strategical move.

I have worked at companies where the tattoo rule was on the book, but never enforced until someone who was already a problem child needed to be removed.

"&gt; What's the physical problem holding back scaling up quadcopters to human size?

Going to guess a few things make this more difficult than simply ""take this toy quadcopter and make it really big with a seat"".

It's bigger.  Bigger means heavier, which means material and structure considerations.  Airframe stresses will be greater.  Motors are bigger which mean bigger batteries, meaning power management is going to be complex.  How are they going to get the power/weight ratio so that they get optimal flight times and still have it meet the market in terms of the price that will make it profitable?  They will be carrying human cargo, meaning a lot of requirements for safety and design specs that must meet strict FAA guides for certification.  It also means that flight characteristics can't be the same as one not carrying living cargo -- it can't exceed a level of G-forces, acceleration has to be smooth, altitude changes can't be as abrupt.  An autopiloted vehicle carrying people means collision avoidance has to be really tight and there are also considerations that have to be taken including that there will be the expectation that this thing will be flying in aerial traffic and dealing with others also flying in the same airspace.  How does it handle a crash?  How does it deal with sudden inclement weather?  How does it know where to land?  The people on board will not have the ability to take over flight controls and aren't trained in how to fly so this thing has to be *fully* self controlled, always, in all conditions and situations.  That hasn't been done in any other aerial vehicle that carries people, before, ever and is not a trivial issue by any means.  Right now if an engine fails on your flight from Dallas to Atlanta, the pilot knows exactly what to do.  This thing will have to programmatically handle *everything* in terms of equipment, sensor, and engine failures and it will have to do it well.  It is *way* more difficult than, say, a self-driving car and we're not yet in production on those despite *decades* of development.

And this is only the stuff I can think of off the top of my head -- the actual engineers actually on this project are dealing with an incredible amount of other problems they'll be spending years on finding solutions to."	news	news	1

1468	"About the finite judgment within infinity... 

In my opinion, judging someone let's say for a century for the sins they had commit cannot impact a person because after one century of judgment he goes back and is able to enjoy all eternity of heaven. Plus, sending people to hell for a limited amount of time would cause the people to accept God out of fear and selfishness, not out of the change of heart towards God, people would just accept God to stop returning to hell. 

God created people in the Garden of Eden and His intention was not that we ever end up where we did. 

But God gave us that option to walk away from Himself because if we did not have the option to do so, our love for Him would no longer be real. 

If you have a wife and she does not have the option to ever walk away from you, to cheat on you, or to even argue with you, she is under your complete submission... She might be a good wife?! I guess? But does she love you if she has no other choice but to be with you?

People are left to make the decision while alive, not after they die because as I said, people would accept God out of selfishness and fear once they see what hell is like."	"&gt;Besides the fact that I'm saying you have no way of actually verifying that that would be how any possible existing hell would work besides one claim of it, nothing in the book says that they cannot change their viewpoint in hell. Of course, there might be a verse there I overlooked that says otherwise. But still, robbing them of the ability to change their convictions of evil seems to be unbenevolent. Why ever rob beings of their capacity to change for the good? Just because at one point they possessed a lot of evil?

You can't change for better in a place where God is absent. In Christianity God is the source of all good. 

&gt;The mere fact that any love at all is removed in hell is already an argument against God supposedly being maximally benevolent in all his actions.

God is also maximally just.

&gt;Therefore, why not create only angels?

Why not create humans? 

&gt;Because it is more benevolent than simply disposing of them regardless of their capacity to change or regardless of God's omnipotent ability to reform them at some point.

What makes you think that someone who hated God their whole life will change in hell willingly and be not forced by the pain to change? 


If God shall judge people accordingly to deeds and not the deity the people chose to pursue throughout life. Then yes, people should be in hell temporarily. But so should people who go to heaven be sentenced to only a temporary amount of heaven life for their limited amount of good deeds."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	1

The referee on the field has to make a split second decision, he can’t say “No conclusion”, why should we allow the reviewing referees to say that.

There are cases to the contrary done by SCOTUS that has said kids can pray, and even a right to privacy when passing notes.  How much of that is actually enforced can be debated where teachers and principals will get away with anything they want to bully you into believing, but kids definitely retain stuff like free speech rights... as long as you understand time, manner, and place restrictions that may take place.

Justices can be wrong.  I get that the precedent is contrary, but it wasn't the original intent of the authors of the Constitution to have it read in such a manner.  You can find that in much of the debates during the adoption process of the Constitution where such expansive reading of the Constitution was feared, and a far more narrow interpretation was intended.

The hole to make the interstate commerce clause mean Congress has practically no limits at all in terms of regulating the lives of individual citizens is precisely what everybody was trying to avoid when the federal government was established in the first place.

&gt; He either purchases the wheat

If the wheat isn't on hand, he could also simply slaughter the animals or switch to some other form of fodder.  It doesn't need to be wheat purchased from somebody else.  That is precisely why it is a fallacious argument.  There are literally unlimited options *besides* simply buying grain on the market.

It is entirely unreasonable to say the farmer would purchase grain, as that is presupposing that there was no alternative at all.

I get this is the justification, but in this case the justice was simply wrong.  These justices aren't gods who pontificate the final word on everything, and they also don't operate in a perfect environment free of political considerations as well.  In this case it was a justice who was trying hard not to get FDR to pack the court with a bunch more justices to overturn his decision and to toss FDR a small bone in his direction to show there might be a plausible legal cover for his actions.

The end result of this decision though is to massively expand the scope of the federal government.  For the most part, the federal government was never supposed to be controlling the behavior of ordinary citizens, but rather to be a referee between states.  The only time the federal government should have been involved with citizens is primarily when they were dealing with citizens of other states or when citizens were going to or from other countries.  This decision threw that whole concept out the window (although as you point out previous courts also disregarded that principle)."	Libertarian	Libertarian	1

25 F Traveling to Singapore/Indonesia/ Australia in November. I am going on a 19 day NCL cruise along with a few nights stay at each end (Singapore/Sydney). I am flying with Emerites airlines from Boston, with a layover obviously in Dubai before heading to Singapore. 
My stops on my cruise are : Singapore,, Semarang, Bali, Komodo Island, Darwin, Cairns, Airlie Beach, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney

I have a few questions:


1. I check the dimensions /weight for Emerites, and I am allowed 2 checked bags (50lb each)  and ONLY 1 carry on that can not exceed 15lbs. I plan on using the 2 check bags ( we will have 4 in total, since I am traveling with a SO). I understand that this is a lot of bags allowed, but I bring my camera/laptop/electronics/medicine as a carry on. I also plan on bringing a few days of clothes on carry on so when i am in singapore I can just live out of carry on. I wanted to use a wheely overhead bag, but I do like to keep a few things under seat for easy access on a long flight.*How strict are they on 15lb weight, and do they allow you to put any thing under the seat if you already have a overhead bin bag?*

2. I will have a few overnight stops at : Bali, Darwn,  and Cairns. *Does anyone have any MUST SEE for any of those place or any other places on my trip*

3. *Does anyone have any packing tips for a month long trip like this with 19 days on a cruise (NCL Jewel)?*

4. I have 7 days at sea, that are mostly spread out with 2 of them being back to back to each other.* Does anyone have an suggestions to keep ourselfs from going stir crazy.* I plan on seeing the shows/entertainment they offer on cruise, but I think I will see everything after 2-3 days.

1490	"Thanks, physioworld. It's nice to get another thoughtful and interesting reply. I'll try my best to address your objections. 

&gt;it is more analogous to playing squash alone- you can practice the game, enjoy yourself and do something worthwhile. It isn't the same as a full game, probably isn't as good, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.

Squash is a game invented by men to be played between two men. It follows that a man can *practice* squash by himself but he cannot play squash by himself any more than he can sing a duet by himself. 

But what's wrong with hitting a squash ball by yourself so long as you don't claim to be playing squash? There is an important difference here. And to see it I think we need to appeal to the Aristotelian idea of final causes. Sexual energy is intrinsically ordered toward the other; that is, the normal and healthy end to which sexual energy is directed is unitive and reproductive intercourse between a man and a woman. For sexual energy to be directed at any other end is simply what it means to be disordered. 

&gt;As for your next point about it being quasi-homosexual, even if I accept your line of argument and agree that it is, so what? Homosexualty is wrong only from a fairly narrow christian perspective.

I think the arguments here are as strong or stronger than those against masturbation. However, as I said in my footnote, I did not want to pursue the matter here. But see *Revelation: From Metaphor to Analogy* by Richard Swinburne, p.303-306. This might be the subject of my next post.

&gt;I don't see that you demonstrated its selfishness. 

Masturbation is paradigmatically narcissistic. Can that really be denied? 

&gt;Arguably if masturbating caused couples to devote less sexual energy to their partner than they otherwise would then there is something there, but for the single person it can't detract from anothers pleasure and even in a couple, in my experience it actually enhances desire.

There is something to be said for saving your sexual pleasure for the woman you love—for letting your spouse have a monopoly on your sexual pleasure and for making her body the only naked body you enjoy. Not only does it make sexual pleasure something special shared only between the two of you, but it gives her an erotic power and allure over you that I can attest inspires adoration, fascination and devotion. It therefore has a powerful unitive effect. I think you do a disservice to your wife and your relationship by diluting this by masturbating (especially when coupled with pornography depicting the bodies of other woman) and I think denying her that, and denying your relationship that, because you insist on arrogating pleasure to yourself by masturbating to porn in private is very selfish.

Plus, you know, what Lewis said. The mechanism by which monogamous sex sans masturbation produces virtue needs to be addressed by any opponent of my argument.

&gt;I'm actually somewhat with you on the question of pornography

I'm glad to hear it.

&gt;However i can honestly say that if a friend or relation of mine wanted to do porn and was able to prevent the industry from abusing him/her ... I would have no objection

I assume you speak of someone you love. To love someone is to will their good. What about the objection that her choice prevents the richest fulfilment of human sexuality in unitive romantic sex between monogamous heterosexual spouses leading to children and family love? How could you not wish this for anyone you love? I have already given arguments for why this *is* the richest fulfilment of human sexuality.  

&gt;One could find an analogy with the way that tech is manufactured in some parts of the world. There is nothing implicitly wrong with assembling circuit boards for apple,

But my argument is that pornography is implicitly wrong and worse when it entails aggression and abuse.

&gt;This argument holds with respect to any form of pornography whatever; but it holds a fortiori with respect to the sort of pornography that has become almost normative online in recent times"	"Even the most enthusiastic masturbator in the world is unlikely to publicly declare that his masturbation and pornography use are something he is proud of. But is there really any harm in it? The Catholic Church defines masturbation as a mortal sin. In this post I am going to defend the view that the Church teaching on this issue is morally coherent.
     
**1. Maturbation Is Sexually Disordered**

Let me begin with a modest claim about masturbation: It is highly doubtful that a good counterargument can be mounted against the view that masturbation is sexually disordered—where ""disordered"" is understood to mean, ""contrary to the normal and healthy functioning or purpose of something""—in this case, human sexuality. 

Clearly enough, a boy who is rubbing his genitals has not discovered the unitive and reproductive ends towards which the motivating urge is directed. Who can deny that he still has an important further fact to learn about sex? Or, if the masturbator is an adult man, who can deny that what is missing from the room when he masturbates is as critical to the completion and fulfilment of human sexuality as is an opponent to a solitary man on a tennis court who wishes to play a game of tennis? 
      
Peter Damian, a Doctor of the Roman Catholic Church, has even suggested that masturbation is a form of low-grade homosexuality—a point which entails masturbation is disordered *ipso facto* for *heterosexual* men. [1] The claim is as amusing at first glance as it is reasonable on reflection. For consider what is happening when a man masturbates: In a room in which a woman is nowhere to be found, a male hand is bringing a male penis to orgasm—so be it that the hand and penis belong to the same man. In *The Porn Trap*, Wendy and Larry Maltz make the further point that, for this very reason, heterosexual boys have always tried to use pornography to ""heterosexualize"" masturbation, 

&gt;Rather than focus on the fact that they are stimulating male genitals, they can focus on the reassuring presence of a female.

The obvious qualification that *no female is actually present* gives the lie to the attempted deception: For in the final analysis masturbating to heterosexual pornography is no more a form of ""heterosexual sex"" than a shoe is ""food"" if while eating it I look at pictures of bread. But more on pornography in just a moment.
       
**2. Masturbation Is Morally Bad**

**2.1 It Is Paradigmatically Selfish**

That the act is perverse and paradigmatically selfish is, I think, fairly obvious. John Paul II, in his *Theology of the Body*, argues persuasively that, ""pornography and masturbation represent the destruction of the symbolic and nuptial meaning of the human body."" For, as he says, ""God gives all men and women erotic energy,"" that, ""forms part of that attraction between men and women."" [2] That, of itself, is a profound good. But it follows that, 

&gt;Sexual energy needs to find its outlet in love, not lust: In masturbation that erotic energy is turned in on oneself. Masturbation, therefore, is a symbol not of love but of loneliness.

**2.2 It Impedes Virtue and Produces Vice**

Consider: A man who constrains his sexual activity to one woman with whom he is in love enjoys the imposition of what is probably one of the few constraints upon his libido that is stronger than his libido—love itself. In other words, a loving husband who only achieves orgasm with the woman he loves quickly discovers that in the interests of cherishing and respecting her he will frequently need to overcome and set aside his carnal urges—to give up on the idea of performing some sexual act that his wife finds embarrassing, for example; or to give up on the idea of having sex altogether in order to nurse his wife because she feels unwell—and so forth. In this way, over time, and by force of habit, his love and respect for the other surpasses his pursuit of personal gratification. And as Plato said, ""A man becomes brave by acting bravely."" He means that we shape our moral character over time by our moral choices. The implications of this should be obvious

You might object here that a loving but masturbating husband does all these things too only he also masturbates in private—perhaps the better to control his carnal urges. But this objection entirely misses the point. For the man who has an orgasm whenever he wants and with whatever fantasy or pornographic aid he wants does not enjoy *any* inter-personal constraint upon his sexual release. C. S. Lewis understood this well when he wrote,

&gt;The real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete and correct his own personality in that of another and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides ... For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity.

**2.3 Pornography Massively Compounds the Moral Problem**

Masturbation is almost always coupled with pornography abuse. Lewis himself wrote well before the spread of online pornography. However, the relevance and wisdom of his warning is greater than ever. On the subject of pornography the Catechism of the Catholic Church reads,

&gt;Pornography does grave injury to the dignity of its participants since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. 

It is logical: You cannot love, respect and will the good of another human being and simultaneously derive gratification from watching them do something harmful or have something harmful done to them. The question arises: Is choosing to become a pornographic actress a good thing for a woman to do?

The question can be brought home by imagining that your mother, sister, daughter or wife is the woman in question. Sexual intercourse has the potential to be the most wonderful experience of human life—from its romantic and unitive force in a loving relationship to its production of children and so of family love. Contrast this with the life of a pornographic actress for whom sex and love are alienated so that her body can be objectified for profit.

If you cannot with perfect equanimity entertain the prospect of one of your loved ones becoming a pornographic actress then you are morally compromising yourself every time you watch and masturbate to pornography. For to enjoy pornography and masturbation one has to follow the *opposite* moral path of the man who constrains his sexual activity to one woman with whom he is in love; namely, he has to allow his sexual desires to eclipse his love and respect for the other. And to do so—and to make a habit of doing so—is, Plato reminds us, simply to become a perverse, selfish, callous and unloving person.

This argument holds with respect to any form of pornography whatever; but it holds *a fortiori* with respect to the sort of pornography that has become almost normative online in recent times. There are various studies that can now be found on the prevalence and frequency of verbal and physical aggression towards woman in pornographic videos today. A fairly typical example reviews 304 popular videos and reports that,

&gt;88% of scenes contained physical aggressive behavior (such as choking or spanking), and 49% contained verbal aggression (mostly name calling). Almost all (94%) of aggressive behavior was directed towards women and elicited a positive or neutral response.

**Conclusion**

Indulging in masturbation and pornography is morally inimical because it is sexually disordered, paradigmatically selfish, promotes vice in the form of the pursuit of personal pleasure above the good of the other, and supports an industry that objectifies and injures the dignity of its participants. The *a priori* coherence of Catholic Church teaching on this subject is a small item of further evidence for the truth of the Catholic Faith. And I believe the moral wisdom of all this is taught and neatly compendiated by Jesus in Matthew 5:27–28.

This seems to suggest there were 12,996 murders that year of which a mere 278 were justifiable self defence by private citizens so rather than the 80% you seemed to suggest, it's actually more like 2% or if we're generous and include cops killing perps it rises to 5%.

"I'm not just talking about the perpetrators of the crimes being killed, I'm talking about the victims.  What I'm getting at is that you seem to be promoting the idea that having large numbers of guns around makes the country safer due to all the defensive gun use you think occurs.  I was just wondering, therefore, why despite a fairly typical overall crime rate for a developed nation, the US has so many murders.  You see it appears quite likely that the very fact so many people have guns for defence is one of the causes of the high murder rate because even minor offences like stealing a car become shootouts when ""good guy with a gun"" runs out of his house with his glock and starts a shootout with ""bad guy with a gun"", turning a minor property crime into a potential murder if good guy loses.  The stats seem to support this to some extent, do you consider it possible?  Or to put it another way, if high gun ownership is the key to self defence, why are you so much more likely to be murdered in the one developed country (I believe?) that allows owning a gun for self defence?

This frequency is much lower than the diatomic molecule resonant frequencies mentioned earlier. If 2.45 GHz were the resonant frequency of water molecules the microwaves would all be absorbed in the surface layer of a substance (liquid water or food) and so the interior of the food would not get cooked at all. "	"I remember a professor giving a simple parable example of a [Decision problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem). The [Buridan's ass problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass).

In real world computing, random noise often makes the choice. It randomly biases the decision to one or the other.

&gt;A version of Buridan's principle actually occurs in electrical engineering.[7][8][9][10][11] Specifically, the input to a digital logic gate must convert a continuous voltage value into either a 0 or a 1, which is typically sampled and then processed. If the input is changing and at an intermediate value when sampled, the input stage acts like a comparator. The voltage value can then be likened to the position of the ass, and the values 0 and 1 represent the bales of hay. Like the situation of the starving ass, there exists an input on which the converter cannot make a proper decision, and the output remains balanced in a metastable state between the two stable states for an undetermined length of time, **until random noise in the circuit makes it converge to one of the stable states.**

In computing 1/2 bit of noise is sometimes added to an input for precisely this reason. On a series of sampled data, the random noise can actually give a better precision to a measurement than without it.

Dithering:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither

&gt;Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data, and is often one of the last stages of mastering audio to a CD."	askscience	askscience	1

I guess the difference is that in a car everyone needs to be able to do it. There are plenty of prior who have trouble with 4 gears. 18 would be a disaster if everyone had to deal with them.

I guess that's why we have speed limits too (one of the reasons anyway) - not everyone is capable of dealing with the complexity of driving in a congested area at high speed.

If you had 7th and 8th they would be hard to select rapidly and without error because there's no other place to put them in the selection mechanism.

I'm not sure how they do it with trucks that have 18 gears but, as one of the other posters said, it's a real pain in the ass to start in 1st when you have so many to choose from. Part of that reason must be the difficulty of actually selecting the gear with the stick(s).

I still don't enjoy Daenerys very much, I'm tired of hearing her talk about ""breaking the wheel"" when she just wants to benefit from it, but at least she has interaction with the main cast.

I love the first three books and I find Feast/Dance a huge chore to get through. There's a certain core group of characters I care about, and when it focuses on others, I lose interest (even though I appreciate all the detail and worldbuilding)."	asoiaf	asoiaf	1

1565	"&gt;I don't think you can just go look at what he's listed as on [NFL.com](https://NFL.com) and say he's ready to handle a huge workload. That 213 pounds looks like 205 to me when you watch him.. Saw him play in college and last year. He is pretty lanky and skinny, no way around it.

&amp;#x200B;"	"He is definitely lanky and skinny by NFL RB standards, I don't know how that is debatable if you look at *most* bell cows around the league. Sounds like you guys all drafted him and are hoping for the diamond in the rough. Maybe he will be, we'll see. He's got talent, but I haven't seen anything about his playstyle that makes me think this is some workhorse back for a team to lean on heavily. I see a complementary, change of pace outside runner who happens to be top dog in a weak backfield. I don't think you can just say ""He's the same size as LeSean McCoy, look how much he's done!"" Shady has been one of the game's most gifted backs for almost a decade, and runs pretty strong given his size. Mack is a late 4th round pick coming off an okay rookie year, and I didn't exactly see someone who runs bigger than he is. I saw the opposite if anything.

&amp;#x200B;

The Colts haven't invested significant draft capital in Mack.  He averaged 3.7 ypc last year, and outside of some flashes, mostly underwhelmed. He's dealing with hamstring issues. If Wilkins or anyone else plays well or is the hot hand, there isn't any reason to just hand all the duties over to Mack. He's a fine sleeper in the 9th round range I suppose, but my main point is that I agree with the first post, I'm not fully understanding the hype. Other than you're getting a de facto #1 RB? Who will still be part of an Indy rushing attack that looks like prime RBBC, and from top to bottom can be argued as of the most questionable in the league talent-wise.

&amp;#x200B;

But hey, the fact I actually just typed all of that out probably means the opposite will happen, he'll get 200+ carries and go off this year."	fantasyfootball	fantasyfootball	1
1566	Thanks. The minutes that follow are strange, aren't they? I guess that's the shock as you said. I remember being very angry with myself even though it wasn't my fault. I don't think things really sunk in until after I woke up from surgery. How long ago was your injury? I'm extremely cautious now too, especially around sharp objects. I wonder if that will ever fade? I've recovered physically as best I can and a few months ago I would have never dreamed of showing my hand so things are progressing :) were you able to return to the place where you were injured? That's one hang up I can't get past but I've accepted that; it wouldn't be a good idea for me to return. 	It was a little rough; my finger became pretty swollen as we were trying to fit it properly 😧 but I'm going back next week and we're going to practice with it together.

1568	"That was Sacriel and it’s his personality to complain about every game he plays. For a guy who’s career was built off of playing DayZ, he trashes on the game and the developers a whole lot. 

I get that the clip was a strange bug of someone shooting themselves in the head, but come on... it’s an unfinished stress test version of 0.63, being played on the highly wip and unfinished offline singleplayer mode, where the shooter is partially in a tree and not aiming down sights where there is a possibility that the bullet hit a collision box from the tree branch and fell right into his head.

Most of the time I’ve spent in 0.63 has been unloading AKM mags into random objects, walls, and terrain. The ricochet patterns are pretty crazy in 0.63. IMO they’re a little too extreme, but I will test further. Wildest ricochet  I’ve had so far was maybe 60 degrees right of the target, and the bullet was shot through a metal fence at the NWAF, hit the corner of a hesco barrier, and then the base of a tree that was on the far right edge of my screen.

I can see plenty of pissed off people if their Switch only allows one person to play Pokemon when every other Switch game is fine with it. The 3DS was a bit different as it didn't have multiple users in the same way that the Switch does.	"For what it's worth I've always much preferred Eevee to Pikachu ever since gen 1. As well as preferring their design their evolutions are much more interesting.

From a marketing perspective Pikachu is a much better mascot however. They have a much more distinctive and unique design, whilst Eevee is a more generic cute fox. Eevee has always been kind of a secondary mascot though, along with it's evolutions, as it represents the whole evolution concept. Pikachu's evolutions are basically completely ignored by marketing whilst Eevee's multiple evolutions are a big part of the appeal. I don't see it as a Pikachu VS Eevee thing, but rather that they complement each other nicely."	pokemon	pokemon	1
1574	"Easy solution: Have her schedule her therapy sessions on your game nights. Because honestly, your wife has some serious co-dependency issues it sounds like. 

But in all seriousness: Se is definitely acting like a child and unfortunately you have been enabling her to act this way for a long time so it's going to take some time to recondition. She needs to understand that it is unhealthy to do EVERYTHING together as a couple and not have your own interests - this is called codependency. You are entitled to your space and you should encourage her to have hers. This doesn't mean you'll grow apart, it means you'll grow together with your own interests and avoid resentment down the line. Stop walking on eggshells for this woman, but maintain respect for the fact that something about you having a hobby or interest outside of her is triggering for her and be open to understanding why. And if she can't understand your point of view, you should insist on couples counseling. 

Bottom Line: DO NOT COMPROMISE YOURSELF FOR SOMEONE ELSE WHO DOESN'T RESPECT YOU. It will not end well. You will resent her."	What's best for YOU? If this is what you want to do you should do it. If someone else fits into the plan, great. If not, don't compromise what you want for it or feel bad about it.  And that is advice that goes for both of you. You should always focus on what you want and how you can grow, not someone else's happiness. Sounds like that is what he needed to ultimately do as well. It could be that his heart wasn't really in it all along and he realized at the end he just couldn't turn his back on his life and what he wanted, maybe the extra $20K was a turning point - maybe it's important to him to feel that valued by his employer. It's hard to wrap your self worth up in someone else's dream. Just like you couldn't stay in Maryland for him, he couldn't move to Florida with you, even though it sounds like he tried. I think in the end he just couldn't go through with it even if he really wanted to be with you. It's a difficult conversation for him to have with you, it sucks all around. You're not wrong to be upset with him, but he might have been wrestling with some feelings on this as well. Eventually you'll probably talk and know more. You're very young, you'll bounce back from this relationship. Grieve it and know that patience will bring the right people into your life. Don't let this ruin your move and you making your dream happen - that is huge and you should be very proud for going through with it and doing something you wanted to do for YOU.
