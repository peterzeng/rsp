1	"She sounds like a really bad, lazy pet owner (the dog wouldn't have been destructive if she'd bothered to train it, and 7 months sounds like way too short a time after adopting one dog to get another). That's something I can't respect. And it doesn't sound like you do, either. In fact, this whole post reads like you can't stand her (not blaming you for that, but despite your comment about ""absolutely fucking loving"" her, I see only resentment and contempt here; you talk about her like you hate her guts). And she doesn't seem to have much respect for you. Forget the pets, I think a wedding is a really bad idea.

I mean, I get it, I'm a dog lover. I made it clear to my now-husband when we started dating that I'm a dog person and I always want to have a dog (so, basically, if he wasn't into that, he should walk). He was fine with it, but certainly not the dog lover I was. After we bought a house, I did start to ask him about a timeline for getting a dog. He didn't want to get one right away and kind of dragged his feet, which annoyed me (I worked from home, we had a house with a fenced yard, it was a perfect situation for a dog). But I didn't act like a little shit to get what I wanted. We picked out our dog together and trained her together and he's absolutely in love with her now (he calls her ""my baby"" even though she's elderly now ... and, ya know, not a baby). These kind of things are joint decisions. If she wants pets and you don't, you're incompatible. And she needs to get her shit together and be a responsible pet owner because people like her are the worst."	"This one makes me sick. ""You know I love you so I shouldn't have to tell you"" type.

And after the employee shows your girlfriend some applying techniques, products, color matches her skin makeup, and you guys all agree what works best you can then buy all the makeup(I think you need to buy $50 worth of makeup with the Sephora makeover appointment?, something like that).

Crows are still smart as shit, they know displacement of volume, something humankids don't understand until the age of 4-6, which is why kids are so fucking horrid at pouring liquids from containers. **Dogs and cats don't even understand this**, far from it. Also they're one of the few species seen having fun without any real biological narrative as a genesis. For example, dogs, cats, even humans, we are ticklish but that comes from a urge for us to learn to protect vulnerable areas like armpits, neck, crotch etc., but to ride down a sled down a slope of snow has no real (known) biological prerogative. Same with crows, yet they are one of the few known species to actually sled down snow with objects.

some logic on the server(s) behind `shady.example.com` create a DNS record for `$random.example.com` which points to whatever IP the JS found.  at the end of 5 seconds, the JS makes a call to `$random.example.com` which is going to point to `192.168.1.1` (or whatever...).

25	"I'm not referring to peaks at all. First of all, comparing to the very beginning of Dota 2 being counted on Steam is far from a realistic way to assess anything. Dota 2 was still in beta at that point. Since release, it's more like 40% up. But OP said Dota has a decreasing player base and I said he's right. That has absolutely nothing to do with peaks or with how many players were playing the first month it was on Steam or released. It can be more players than it had the first month and still have a currently shrinking player base. Honestly, the mental gymnastics you guys are doing here to try to avoid looking at the reality of the situation is pretty incredible (not to mention the downvotes because obviously that's easier than accepting a fact you'd rather not). And I'm not saying this because I'm a Dota hater, I've been watching Dota 2 since TI1 and playing since October 2012. I still play and watch all the time but I can also be realistic:

**1 Year** 

Average players - June 2017 555,289.1 | June 2018 473,900.0 - 15% decrease.

**6 Months**

Average players - December 2017 513,074.3 | June 2018 473,900.0 - 8% decrease.

**1 Month**

Average players - May 2018 474,325.9 | June 2018 473,900.0 - a decrease of 426.

By every metric, the player base is decreasing. Now, I can admit that if we did the one-month comparison in a different month this year, it would have very slightly increased rather than decreased, but obviously gradual trends are harder to measure in the short term. But the average has never even hit 500k this year, whereas it originally hit 500k in November of 2014 and never went below 500k again until less than a year ago. Honestly, there is absolutely no possibility that you can claim that Dota 2's playerbase isn't shrinking.

In fact Nobel prize winning economist Richard Thaler recently retweeted a data set explaining just how little the impact on the environment the anti-straw movement has, ***BUT*** it does have an impact on how consumers *feel*. They *think* they are making a difference which encourages them to make larger differences.

41	"This is the case because it will result in the expansion of the welfare state and government intervention in wealth redistribution.

Free movement and commerce between the states have been beneficial. But there's also another sense in which open borders between the states has not been beneficial. That is, people in one state have to subsidize people in another state through federal programs and mandates. There's also rent-seeking competition between the states at the federal level. Moreover, the expansion of federal government and centralization of power have continued to usurp individual state local power and autonomy and those of the people within it.

Those same concerns exist when considering open borders between countries. The US citizens will have to carry the burden of the foreigners. As the foreigners gain political power in the country, they have the incentive to favor central government policies that don't respect economic freedom.

One of the fundamental problems is zero-sum political game. If the number of people where you live increases, you have less and less say in your own freedom. You better make sure they don't have the incentive to infringe your liberty.

Was a great little exercise coz you not only learned to quickly dodge, but also recover and continue straight. Cannot stress enough though... DO NOT TOUCH THE BRAKES WHILE DOING THIS.

As for emergency braking, you've no doubt done this with a course, but i will quickly go over it... cover the brakes and clutch, clutch in while tapping down gears to target 1st while simultaneously and slowly applying front and back brake pressure and flatten out the front rubber, then harder and harder, if you lock either the front or back, release and reapply slowly. Slowly applying gives you a bigger footprint on the road as opposed to just applying hard straight up, will lock because its only got the tip of the tyre on the road. Squash it down.

I also want to use this camera for video shots, and although it's not the best camera for videos, I'm better off working with what I have to gain experience before stepping it up.

I was thinking about getting the 50mm f1.4, it's a decent price, 100 euros, and it seems like a really good lens, although it doesn't have a longer focal length.

1. Google tries to solve a problem nobody has solved before, and develops new technologies to do it. (e.g. bigtable)

2. The ideas from those technologies diffuse into the world, and get reimplemented at other companies as open source (e.g. hadoop)

3. The industry rallies around the open source tools. Google is stuck in some weird alternate reality even though they invented the stuff to begin with. (e.g. hadoop ecosystem vs the google architecture)

Basically the boomerang that keeps hitting them in the face is not open sourcing their stuff early on, leaving room for alternate open source solutions to claim that idea space outside of google and losing mindshare as a consequence.

113	"Three years into a relationship isn't easy, and problems can tend to arise. She said something hurtful and also expressed unhappiness with you, and that could be a sign of a deeper issue, or maybe not. How you want to deal with this depends on what you want. Ideally, we all want someone to love us how we become. But in reality, attraction is a crucial element, especially in a relationship when both of you are so young. You don't want to let yourself go. It will also impact your chances of getting the actual women you WANT to date in the future if you both break up for some reason, so taking care of your self is an important habit to learn just in general (if you're into fit women, they typically are also into fit men. Some may be more body positive, but I doubt it.)   


Your partner has let you know that she has a standard of attraction, but it's hypocritical.   


I think it is best to have some communication time with her about the incident. When initiating the conversation, stay civil, and be gentle.  If you want a successful conversation, the tone of your voice should imitate the tone you would want her to respond with. Don't talk to her angry, don't make blaming statements, don't start the convo with raising your voice, or she could immediately get defensive and it could lead to a fight and close her off from receiving your point.   


Stay in control of the conversation through being nice, she'll be more receptive to a positive discussion. Casually, let her know that when she told you that when she said that she wished that you had abs, it made you feel negatively and that of course you want to keep her attracted to you, but you also want to keep things fair in the relationship and that you expect the same effort as well. Keep it positive and let her know you're willing to work, if she is. Tell her you'll work on getting back to your old body fat percentage, and give her your reasonable goals for your own body weight, and let her know your effort needs to also be reciprocated.  


If my partner is not in shape, of course I want my partner to be and stay in shape and put in equal effort, if I am also putting in the work to keep my partner happy and attracted to me.  We can't do much about our partners subjective perspectives of attraction, especially when we're young. But if I am working to stay and shape and I know my partner isn't, I am not going to be happy. But instead of dealing with relationship issues like yours through anger, or hurt, or insecurity, it's not only more sexier to your partner to approach conflict in your relationship with confidence, but also kindness. Unless she's generally a complete bitch. Then I don't know what to tell you. Why are you with her then, lol.  


Eventually if you see yourself long term with her and even marriage, when you guys get to the point of engagement, you might want to talk to her about her expectations when both of you age, if she's flipping out now at your guys' age about your looks, I don't know how she's going to handle getting both you and her getting older, wrinkles, and if she gets pregnant and gains weight through pregnancy. But she's young, perspective comes with maturity.  


Anyways,

Losing weight together is a commitment but it will be one of the healthiest and best decisions of your life (and hers). I'm 27, I lost 30 pounds recently, i'm more confident, I feel better all around, no more back or knee pain where I would have to elevate and ice my knee and be out for the whole day, I'm happier because I get to listen to more music and I get endorphins when working out, which boosts my performance and mood throughout the day, no crap preservatives and fake food messing with my hormones, sugar levels, or chemical balance, as much as they used to. Also the quality of ass I'm getting is EXPONENTIALLY better. Good luck

114	"How does land area correlate with crime rates? Your article is good at building strawmen. For starters it claims that people that to only compare relatively wealthy countries is racist. Those countries have high crime rates because they've gotten the short end of the stick during colonialism. This caused high amounts of poverty and inequality. I find this argument highly hypocritical as libertarians are very often for neocolonial methods. To get back to the point. The article also claims that other highly industrialised countries are more homogenous. While this is true for some east asian countries it really doesn't hold true for Europe. If we look at highly heterogenous countries like Belgium or Switzerland the murder rates are significantly lower. If you subtract suicide from the murder rates the United States are still significantly high. 

Also the article compares Turkey to the USA. Other than Turkey having a bit of a lower standard of life due to a rough 20th century it has very liberal firearms laws. Overall the article claims that so many countries have banned firearms even though they only have gun control. Just to end this I want to remind you that mass shootings by far don't happen as often anywhere in the EU. They used to in some countries. Then they tightened gun control.

And no one claims that the US is bad on an international scale. It has its good sides. But if you compare violent crime rates there to the rates in countries with similar standards of life you notice certain problems. A lot stem from the rampant inequality."

### What You Say You SAID

&gt; that time I flat out said no. He seemed to accept it and I thought that would be the end of it.

### What You Say You FELT

&gt;  I just wanted a day to myself to work on homework and mentally prepare for the coming school week


### What You **Should Have** SAID

&gt; Hey, I‚Äôm tired from my trip and flights. I need a day or two by myself to relax/get situated/catch up on work/sleep/whatever. I‚Äôm really looking forward to seeing you - let‚Äôs plan on [activity in future]. I‚Äôll call you [at desired time in future].


What you *say* should match what you *feel, think, and want.* It‚Äôs very easy to do, just takes some practice. 


&gt; but he made it seem like I was being a bitch


Because he was excited to see his gf after spring break ... only to find that his gf was inexplicably blowing him off (with pathetic excuses, no less). 

When our gf/bf acts like they don‚Äôt want to see us and are increasingly hostile/evasive, generally we assume something is quite wrong. Not kind to do to your partner. 

Poor communication skills **frequently** make non-bitchy, well-meaning people appear as though they are in fact being bitches. 

When poor communication leads someone to indicate that they think you‚Äôre being a bitch, the poor communicator (here: you) is 100% at fault for this situation and responsible for correcting it. Unless your bf can read your mind (can he?!), the only information he has about your feelings and desires is *what you tell him.* 

90+% of relationship problems are purely the result of shitty communication (from both sides, everyone sucks) ‚Äî you‚Äôll save yourself *a lifetime* of grief and needless drama if you learn to communicate effectively.

If the purpose of a trial is to ensure that the only people whose rights are violated (by imprisonment, fine, etc) are those undeniably guilty of violating the rights of another, then it seems logical that both sides of the case should have good representation. Since it‚Äôs the court‚Äôs job to provide justice, I don‚Äôt see a problem with it being the court‚Äôs responsibility to furnish that representation, and make sure it‚Äôs equivalent to the prosecution.

172	"Yeaaa... no.  Before I really start, I will mention the intro below  the title, it is a bit on the factually correct and humorous side:

""Anglo-Saxon capitalism's drive to maximize profits in the short term won't save the planet.  Perhaps the Chinese model can?

But the answer to the question in it is no.

In the following quote we can see a false assertion:

 ""Decarbonisation of the economy requires alternatives for coal and cars  that run on diesel, and that plays to capitalism‚Äôs strengths.  Innovation is what capitalism is all about, and there has been  staggeringly rapid progress in developing clean alternatives to coal,  oil and gas.""

As the author already stated, maximizing the amount of trade widgets is what Capitalism is about.

""Necessity is the mother of invention"", an old saying many are probably familiar with.

 That would be more along the lines of why there has been rapid progress  in developing clean alternatives.  We find our survival to be a  necessity, so it is helping to motivate us to develop these other  technologies.

These technologies have been around for quite a  while now, such as hydroelectric and wind power and we could have been  developing them all along, but corruption and the drive for profits by a  greedy subgroup have held them back.

""Great advances are also  being made in battery technology, which is vital for the new generation  of electricity-powered vehicles.""

Sure, it may be ""important""  now, but what really held back development in the past?  Could it have  been the profit making technique of Planned Obsolescence?  Could be...

 ""And, more than anything, it means accepting that the world needs to  wage war against climate change. Powerful vested interests will say  there is plenty of time to act, and they are aided by climate-change  deniers who say there is nothing to worry about. These people need to be  called out. They are not deniers, they are climate-change appeasers.  And they are just as dangerously misguided as fascism‚Äôs appeasers in the  1930s.""

Here I can agree with the author to an extent.  He does  need to be called out as a Capitalism and Consumerism denier / appeaser."	"&gt; There are no EU-wide taxes at all.

&gt;The right to live and the right to medication are two entirely different things.

What about a new born with a life threatening illness that can only be treated with life saving medication? 

It also slipped mind that either way you WILL get the medication you need via Medicaid. But having every asset and valuable stripped away from you, just so you can live another day is wrong, at least in my opinion.  



&gt;Do you have a right to the Advil or Mucinex at your local Walgreens? Now, I could see a very strong argument for people to have the right to *access* medication. What I mean is, I don't think people have a *right* to most private industry products and services. For example, you don't have a right to buy a Samsung TV. If they decide they don't want to sell TVs this week, tough titties. If the electronics store owner simply doesn't like you, so be it. I can see where we'd want to say ""Biogen, you *cannot* refuse to sell your product to someone"". But I don't see how we can fairly say ""Biogen, you have to sell your product for X price because we say so"".

I completely agree. 

 &gt;Believe it or not, even a product like a life saving medication is subject to price elasticity and can't simply be raised indefinitely.

This is where you're wrong. When your life is on the line, you do whatever it takes. Nothing is too expensive when it's life or death



&gt; Companies want to maximize profit, not simply price items as high as they possibly can. 

Not the pharmaceutical companies we're discussing. The companies we're discussing raised prices ‚Äì not to fund research to discover new drugs ‚Äì but to boost profits for executives and investors. In essence, they operated more like hedge funds than traditional pharmaceutical companies. Then these same companies bought critical life-saving drugs made by one manufacturer and then worked to keep competitors out. Valeant for example raised prices on 2 life saving drugs(Cuprimine and Syprine) from $500 (which was already profitable for a standard pharmaceutical company) to $24,000 for a 30-day supply.

&gt;Do companies have a ""monopoly"" over a specific product? Sure, that's the entire point of patents - to allow temporary total control over a product *you* created. That doesn't constitute an industry monopoly which would require govt intervention. In fact, it's quite silly to think about considering govt intervention is entirely what a patent is!

I agree.

James Gibson (1964) and Al Bregman (1982) both assert that information for perception exists in the world. We don't need to do a lot of cognitive gymnastics or rely on innate skills to interpret it; rather, we just pick up on it. The coloration and skin appearance cues rated in this study are present to different degrees in all sick people. With enough exposure to healthy humans, we can determine the regularity (or regularities) of a healthy appearance. Then, when we see sick people, we know they differ from that norm. Enough exposure to sick people can allow us to develop a regularity for sickness, as well, and perceive appearances as either ""healthy"" or ""sick"" rather than ""healthy"" and ""something's odd"".

Going out on a limb, I'd also hypothesize that gut feelings, pseudoscientific things like mother's intuition or cop's intuition, are also based in available information that is picked up by mothers and cops, respectively. They're probably using standard perceptual information, realizing it doesn't conform to the regularity of the innocent, and interpreting that as some sort of extra sense. Which, of course, it's not.

196	The line should be at least -10, and -7 is phenomenal value for Michigan here (ironically I got down-voted for saying this exact same thing last week against Wisconsin but it was obviously true then too). My write-up on this matchup is in my [picks post on this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/9oei70/week_7_betting_discussion_thread/e7tu8jw), but Michigan's defense is probably the best in the country, Michigan State doesn't have the firepower to keep this a close enough game (especially with their injuries at WR/OL and LJ Scott still being out) and Michigan should be able to use their TEs/RBs in the passing game to exploit Michigan State's run blitzes similar to how how Northwestern used their split back Cameron Green against MSU. 	"There's a few things at play with USF. 

The programs success with filling the stadium in 2007 shows the interest is there. However, the prolonged terrible seasons turned off a lot of fans. Attendance wasn't *terrible* last year but you expect more butts in seats after the team wins 11 games the year before. Now that they've posted back to back 10 win seasons, maybe the success will continue to bring in the casual fan.  Losing that public perception of being in a 'power 5' conference doesn't help. 


Part of the issue with attendance has also been time of games. The AACs desire to have games on primetime weekday slots on ESPN means some teams (such as USF a lot of the past couple seasons) have played games on Thursday or Friday nights. These are still work nights for some people or these are weeknights where there are student events or clubs or Greek things going on. Not a lot of people want to go to a USF game at 7-8pm, leave around 10-11 or later, then not get home on a weekday until midnight almost between commute and traffic. 

I reckon a lot of complaint with Raymond James is also the general decor and feel. The red seats don't really scream USF and is frequently the butt of many jokes rather than seats.  They put a banner up over the Bucs banners but it doesn't *feel* like home. 

Being closer or actually on campus mainly benefits student access. The student section typically turns out well and is sometimes dependant on Greek life (for example recruitment is the first couple weekends of school, directly clashing with attending games). Being within walking distance or a 10 minute shuttle ride across campus is much more favorable than paying 20 bucks to park and drive and such, not to mention those without a vehicle to do so. 

Location wise, Ray Jay is sort of ""better"" in Tampa, it has a lot of major roads nearby so the infrastructure is better. But it's also not really 'home', and I think that's what matters. "	CFB	CFB	-1

Why do you think that is bad?  Making people strive to be better and to be self-reflective.

What's an example?  How would potential be discouraged?  What standard are they living up to?

Totally agree, sometimes.  But this also happens with non-religious ideas.  There are several political ideologies that lead down this path as well.  IMO, it probably speaks more to human nature.

Fuji is probably the best bet, or a m4/3 but the image quality isnt as good for low light and he'll need to crank the shutter speed to comoensate for hand shake.

Fuji lenses are absolutely tiny and super light.

I see you have a recommendation to look at XT-2 but i think thats too much. I recommend looking at something like an XE2 (given your budget) and a third party grip so it stays super light but easier to hold. Meike do one for the XE3 that's great. 

You'll get a super small, super light system with small lenses that is easy to use and has great quality. It's probably the sweet spot given all the constraints.

I shot professionally with the D700 and I'd say if you can push it up to an XE3 you'd get slightly better image quality for higher iso than D700 he's used to (D700 has high iso banding issue) and autofocus is probably a touch better.

And your ""huge armor/mr pool"" doesn't mean much since you don't have a huge health pool to compliment it. Any ADC or Assassin building tank would get better return value than you for the items you buy, simply because you never get any bonus health. It's only math, nothing subjective there, so in my opinion building tanky you just gimp yourself : no matter what you won't get tanky enough to front line, and you won't have the damage to be a threat save for your execute.

So that's why I'd much rather go with items that Pyke can use fully, and utilize his mobility and self-peel to survive rather than brute forcing it. Again, you're an assassin, with a disruptive and bursty kit, and your job is to blow up Fighters and/or ADCs before they can take your own priority targets down (not to mention you as an assassin can become a priority target yourself). If you want full ADC peeling, or tankyness, there are way better supports than Pyke at this. He has some peeling tools, which are useful for laning phase or skirmishes, but in full on team fights that's not your job : Thresh does that way better."	leagueoflegends	leagueoflegends	-1

This use case doesnt seem to be discussed all that often, though this is (imo, though im biased) the most potentially useful aspect of optane...considering that 

1. for a UMA system you *have* to go with a xeon build if you need more than 128 gb of ram (which is a rather large price jump for the same performance other than memory capacity), and 

2. memory is stupid expensive right now

Having the option to add in a half terrabyte of ""slower but usable pseudo-ram"" that doesnt take up a ram dimm slot and is roughly the same cost as a high end 32-gb ddr4 kit (e.g., a 3200 mhz  14-14-14-14 trident z rgb kit and a 460 gb p905 optane drive are within 10% of each others cost right now).

I find it... frustrating how many people use Hell/Heaven as a reason to do more worship or be a better person. Like oftentimes an adult(I'm 17) will tell me ""Hey you should pray at this specific time on this day, because if you do that, it's the equivalent of praying daily for 10 lifetimes!"" And I'm just sitting here thinking, why should I care? I worship God because I'm thankful for my existence, not because I want to go to heaven. The same with being a good person or doing good deeds. I think Heaven or Hell are inherently bad motivators for people to be good people, because then it's not genuine. I'm a good person because I want to be, because it's the right thing. I couldn't care less if I go to Heaven or Hell, as long as I was as good as possible in this life, and achieve my goals of leaving a helpful impact on this world before I die, I'll be content.


So in conclusion, I do find it distressing that people interpret Islam in a way that leads them to perceive that they're being threatened with damnation, instead of being a good person for the sake of being a good person. That's not the way I interpret it, and I never will."	You sort of just say all this stuff is objective. Without actually proving in any way that it is. Is it because you believe in souls?

Hit at least two conventions without any intention of monetizing anything. Shoot a lot of all sort of cosplayers (from those with so-so costumes to the best ones) and post it in your local cosplay FB groups and your social media accounts.  
Go to cosplay gatherings outside convention days once in a while and shoot for free (no need to bring your whole arsenal of flashes, just do simple shoots). The thing is most people cosplay for fun and there's a big sense of community so don't just come to them to sell stuff, do some things for free to help the community members.

I think you should look into some of the philosophy of the American Founding Fathers, Especially James Madison. This is why I follow deism.

Madison was the primary author of the Constitution. For centuries, the contemporary thought was that Gods by their will, granted Kings and queens to rule. The kings and queens then treated their constituents as property, or rentals from god. 

Thus religion was often used as a tool for their political and Machiavellian objectives. Think about Charlameign getting the title of Holy Roman Emperor and using it as a badge of authority to conquer land. Or think Henry the 8th basically creating a new form of Christianity. People think he did this just so he could get married, but what he really did was cut the papal influence from Britain and give himself a larger influence over the British people since he was not only their King, but basically their pope now.

As you can see, religion was not absolute and the rules and customs could easily change as the ruler saw fit. But what the founding fathers and especially Madison noticed was that religion was flawed, but the idea of Theism was not. Kings and religions had too much power and the ability to change. But Madison took a Deistic approach that said philosophically, god exists. And God gave rights (life, liberty, and property) to man. We are going to write a constitution that protects these rights by outlining the rules and procedures that the government must follow. Oh, and by the way, there is a separation of church and state. So now you can't have government officials select one religion to rule them all.

So even though the constitution can change, the concept of God giving rights to all individuals (rather than Kings and religious leaders) is concrete. Due process of the law must be used before these rights can be taken away by the government. Not saying due process always works correctly, but we can always look back and retroactively change the outcomes of supreme court cases with new rulings that are not clouded by the obviously flawed cultural (or religious) beliefs of the past."

Plus manual focus can be a hassle for moving subjects, there's no image stabilisation etc. You might find some individual reviews that will prove otherwise. You can always try a few shots out next time you have film in the camera. 

You could adapt the Nikon mount lenses to use on a Canon DSLR camera with a cheap adaptor ([this is probably OK](https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Mount-Adapter-Nikon-Camera/dp/B01HGDFQAM/) but there's probably something similar for less). However, it's full manual everything and if you're doing it to use those two lenses it might not really be worth it. The 70-210mm could be a respectable portrait lens if you don't have anything else handy :)

One thing to note concerns shutter speeds with telephoto lenses. You'll notice how the tiniest jiggle in your hands is visible through the viewfinder. To stop that from impacting your photos, you need to either put the camera on a tripod, or use a fairly fast shutter speed (even for subjects that are holding still). The old rule of thumb is to use a shutter speed that's the reciprocal of your lens's focal length (on a 35mm camera).... meaning with the 500mm lens, you want a shutter speed of at least 1/500th of a second. Or with the 300mm you want at least 1/300th of a second... 1/200th of a second at 200mm and so on.

The Minolta lenses aren't as easily adapted to a Canon DSLR. You need to use an adaptor with a glass correcting element that does a bit of a number on image quality, and slows the lens down further. So I'd leave them for film only. Mirrorless cameras make adapting lenses a lot easier :)

   No. I was trying to point out the contradiction in your two statements, at least from a moral 'what we should do' point of view.  I was arguing the opposite.
   If guilt causes evil, what is the value of guilt?  Cast aside that which causes evil. Or, biblically, if your hand causes you to sin... (that part I do think is a metaphor... probably)

   I disagree that guilt over the death of christ causes evil and blind devotion.  I also oppose ignorance.  Those who have the truth have no need to keep their followers in ignorance.  Whether we feel guilty over christ, or not, the truth sets us free (from Ignorance, and more).  God is the God of truth. (Isiah 65:16)
   HOWEVER, 'IF' and this is an if, IF guilt is a cause of evil then we should avoid it. IF! 

&gt;A metaphorical/figurative resurrection is a resurrection that didn't happen in any way, shape or form whatsoever? Is that what you're saying here?

  That would appear to be the linguistic interpretation I draw from what you have said, let me know if I am wrong and if you believe in an actual literal resurrection of Christ from the dead after 3 days and into heaven.  If he was actually walking around with a hole in his side and holes in his hand after the resurrection. (Wait... Christ wasn't made whole like those who are resurrected will be, interesting).

&gt; he'd be living happy up in heaven ruling the universe.  

   Yes, that is (in essence) what I believe. However, if you are insinuating that Christ was somehow rewarded, no, that is not what I believe. He returned to his natural place, so in that sense he wasn't rewarded, simply returned to where he belonged, the death and suffering that he did not have to endure was the additional part, paid for us.  Him being in heaven is right and just, him dying, suffering, and being rejected is not.  That is what he paid for us.

&gt;John 14:48 You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
 
I am saying that the resurrection is a true literal event.  Metaphors are linguistic figures of speech in storytelling, to drag the word 'metaphor' and 'parable' in is a bit unclear by the definition, I am simply saying that the resurrection is a true literal event.  I think Paul's letters do not imply or assert Christ as non-literal.

 Christ used parables, but that does not mean he was one. Christ told stories with metaphors, but that does not mean he was one.

 The story of Audie Murphy is very inspirational, but the actual story is his account of an actual real event, not a parable, not a metaphor, an accounting of events.

&gt;&gt; Can a metaphor create the universe? Can a metaphor save anyone from death?
&gt; Yes.

No! That is a very impressive metaphor.  I am not arguing in the inspiration of civilization or the building up of history, I am talking about the literal creation of the universe, the formation of atoms and fundamental building blocks.  Did a metaphor create Jupiter? 

A metaphor is a figure of speech. a parable is a story. Can either of those stop Jupiter in a second? (I had to go big for simplicity)
  
Metaphor: a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.
Parable: a simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson, as told by Jesus in the Gospels.

Neither of those can pick up a rock and throw it, much less create the sun.

&gt; As a secular Christian, none. It's all metaphor and parable.

Let's reduce this a bit (simplify it), the term 'metaphor' and 'parable' aren't really helpful.  Question, do you believe that the resurrection of Jesus christ actually, literally, occurred.  Did he die and rise again?  Will you as a flesh-and-blood breathing human being?  My memory is not me, I have a pulse, my memory does not, it's not who I am, I believe we will VERY LITERALLY be resurrected from DEATH by the power of God through Christ. 

Question(Intended rhetorically, but I'll accept answers): Can you name one Christian born after Christ but before 300AD whose name is not recorded therein or in any historical documents. Can you ask Paul who ""lives on in memory""? Name a Christian tailor who lived in ancient Rome.  Tell me your great-grandfathers favorite color.  If he 'lives' in memory, ask him.  By life, I mean life. By lives, I mean lives and breathes. To live on in memory is a figure of speech, an idiom.  To equate what I mean to what you mean is a fallacy of equivocation.

The same can be said of our definitions of God. It's not what Christ offered, nor is it anything I care about.  If being remembered is the reward, why pray in secret? (Matthew 6:6).

What I define as God, is very REAL, he would exist without words, without memory, without us, he would still exist. He existed before anything else, and he would continue to exist even if every book were erased and every mind rendered blank, and even if I didn't define him.  If every man on this planet perished God could still raise them all up with less effort than it takes me to draw breath, and he could flood the world if he hadn't promised not to.

&gt; If helping people is a sin, I don't want to meet God.

Helping people is not a sin, and if that is all you've done in your life, I'm impressed.

&gt; If a miraculous pit of fire and torture are waiting for me, I'll gladly suffer knowing an evil God is responsible for my pain, and what I did in life is a thing I am proud of.

God is not evil. Suffering is earned. Helping people is not a sin (have you really not sinned?). An evil God wouldn't allow you to confess your sins and be forgiven. (John 20:23)  An evil God wouldn't spare the world for a few righteous who could be saved and command them to save one another, thus saving as many as he could.  An evil God wouldn't warn Adam and Eve before the fall, he'd simply laugh at their misfortune.  If anyone would like to discuss ""The problem of evil"" (basically, is God evil), I will discuss that later, but the scope is beyond this thread."	If I pray for someone to be healed and they are, the appropriate response for me is gratitude, whether they were healed as a result of my prayer or not. I simply thank God and move on, without trying to determine whether or not my prayer(s) were efficacious. 	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

May has the absolute authority to offer or remove positions, but she can't force people to take positions if they don't want them, and she can't necessarily force people out of positions if it will cost her more support than it gains her. She has to please her ministers, her backbench MPs, the Conservative party infrastructure, her voters, the media and the wider public. 

It's important to note that we don't have a presidential system, so the PM governs by consent of their colleagues rather than a direct election for Prime Minister. All PMs have to keep their people happy, but with her tiny majority she has to worry about it more than a typical PM. And her colleagues know this.

If a loyal lapdog like Jeremy Hunt says ""No"" to an offered position, she's left with two options: fire him or leave him be. Since firing him will create too much dissent and trouble among the other lapdogs, and it would only take a few dissenters to derail her majority in Parliament, she was forced to let him stay where he was.

Justine Greening said ""No"" to her demotion, and because she hasn't always publically agreed with the PM on everything, May stood to gain a bit more than she'd lose by firing her, and no one would blame her for it. So Greening and Hunt gave the same answer, and one stayed while the other one got the sack."

My self esteem would get lower and lower and I would tolerate a lot of abuse that I shouldn't have just because I felt like I deserved it, that they weren't wrong about me, just being honest.

Don't ever be with someone that wants to ""fix you"", it's always a toxic mess that ends badly for you. The only person responsible for improving your life and your self esteem is *you*.

"	"&gt; There are so many possibilities of GO the theory is there isn't enough time for humans to realistically play out every potential. So in this sense with an AI you can have it try trillions of variations in such little time its scary.

AlphaGo does not consider trillions of possibilities. It has learned a positional understanding/intuition from seeing how positions play out. The original combined supervised training using expert games with Reinforcement Learning based on self-play using self-guided Monte Carlo search/sampling. The newest version, AlphaZero, was trained solely from self-play, and achieved the strongest results ever in Go, Chess and Shogi. Interestingly, when playing chess against Stockfish, AZ evaluated less than 100'000 positions every second, whereas Stockfish evaluated like two thousand times more. AZ had learned a better evaluation function, and was able to waste much less time on considering less promising branches.

Having unlimited Actions Per Minute is useless if the actions are not well-considered. Even in simple Atari games, RL agents are often trained with frameskip (unconditional input repetition) to reduce the complexity. Anyhow, when Deepmind take on the challenge of SC2, they will obviously not want to be seen as cheaters who use a superhuman action rate. They take on the game from a perspective that closely resembles ours. Full fog of war, acting through a movable view etc.

Starcraft is complex in many ways that Go is not. Namely with high interaction rate (and merciless opponents that don't wait), vast and continuous action space, indirect and incomplete access to game state (imperfect information) and indirect access to the full action space (through movable view). All of this complicates planning, which will have to abstract away a lot of the dimensionality while building and maintaining an essential understanding of the game. There is also resource acquisition and allocation, and (as in board games) strategy and tactics (in SC2 possibly even including multiplayer alliances).

Solving (beating the best humans in) SC2 by self-play would be a major milestone for AI, and I would frankly tremble in my pants if that were to happen any time soon."	starcraft	starcraft	-1
276	"""Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can't. If a thing is free to be good it's also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they've got to be free.
Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently, He thought it worth the risk. (...) If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will -that is, for making a real world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings- then we may take it it is worth paying."" - C.S. Lewis, The Case for Christianity"	"Personally I've never felt any spiritual experience that confirmed to me the existence of God or any religion. I've had experiences I would call transcendent, or numinous in the sense of ""appealing to the higher emotions or to the aesthetic sense"" as Merriam-Webster puts it. But I've had no experience that manifested the existence of God. Religious people often testify to having experiences, of for example nature, or human connection, that somehow verify to them that God exists and/or a religion is true. For me, I have the same experiences of being awe-inspired by nature, or music, or being enraptured by a connection with another human, but these experiences have no connection to the existence of God or the truth of a religion. 

If you believe God is real and is known through spiritual experience, why do I (and millions of others) have no such experience?

293	"I‚Äôm an atheist, but the question was interesting to think about. I thought sin is defined as being an act against the Christian God or (via Google)

&gt; an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law.

I will assume the claim that the Christian God is both omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent which I believe is the general accepted definition.

I guess it boils down to if everything God does is considered ‚Äúdivine law‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs impossible for him to sin in that definition, though not impossible for God to say change what ‚Äúdivine law‚Äù means namely one second it‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat shellfish‚Äù but the next second ‚Äúeating shellfish is ok‚Äù due to the claim of omnipotence.

If God is say below his own mandated law (God can sin) then he wouldn‚Äôt be omnipotent as God would be constrained by by his own mandate, so if we go with an omnipotent God I suppose the only answer is that everything God does is mandated divine law. Namely the Christian God is necessarily good to avoid violating the claim of omnipotence? 

Now I suppose a question of if God can‚Äôt sin and everything God does is mandated divine law, does that violate omnipotence since we‚Äôve basically discovered something that God can‚Äôt do. IMO no since sin by definition is going against divine law, it doesn‚Äôt say that God can‚Äôt do something he regrets. Just that the regrettable thing he did is something that was divine law at the time and he changed his mind so to speak.

Now I suppose the question is can an omniscient God actually change their mind as being omniscient would necessitate that God comprehends the consequences of his actions with 100% fidelity. I think it‚Äôs possible if you assume that God has the capacity to make both rational and irrational decisions due to omnipotence. So if God can make irrational choices then I believe he can do something he regrets.

So why or how would God do something he regrets? Well what if the irrational action was the benevolent one? If we assume God behaves benevolently, perhaps God must sometimes act irrationally to preserve acting benevolently? This would of course mean that divine law is therefore irrational since it‚Äôs impossible to know which laws were provided when God was acting rationally and when God was acting irrationally. So you can only have faith that in the end divine law consists of benevolent choices regardless of the rationality.

Obviously then questions of if God can be irrational, can he actually act benevolently  in all cases or are there cases where he does not act benevolently due to the fact that he can be irrational?

The follow up question of why follow an irrational God isn‚Äôt one I‚Äôm able to answer though."	What about the fact that Jewish circumcisions are the minority of circumcisions in the US and Canada, and probably everywhere except Israel?	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

296	"You are not right. There are some considerable initial paywalls for those who want to experience the end-game content in gw2. 

For example, to play t4 a new player needs atleast(!) one full asc set with infusions, so you have to lvl up some crafting professions and then you should buy mats for your asc weapons and armor. And if you don't want to spend tens of hours at the SW/Istan farm (many ppl here have a life or don't like the autistic nature of money-grinding activities in gw2, you know), then your only choice is to buy Gems. 
Otherwise, one will have to deal with some intentional time-gates.

That's actually why ascended tiers (and Agony Resistance) were introduced: to stumulate the community to buy more gems. That is how NCsoft/Anet and other companies of such kind run their businesses.

And for the raids, the paywall may be even higher, because to raid effectively you may want to buy some expensive infusions.

And don't forget that the main topic of the raid LFG is SELLING raids (i think, that is why we don't have any ingame ""training versions of raids"" like they have in WoW or in FFxiv: it seems like Anet isn't interested in developing/promoting such systems), and buying raids will cost you... thousands of gold.

There is no such thing as an incomplete monopoly, that's one of the most moronic things I've ever heard. I'm not attempting to define monopoly, you don't seem to understand that. Since you brought it up, dictionary.com defines monopoly as:

&gt;exclusive control of a commodity or service in a particular market, or a control that makes possible the manipulation of prices.

Which is exactly how I define it.

The point I am making, is that obtaining and maintaining that exclusive control and ability to manipulate prices *requires* government intervention. It is literally not possible for it to happen otherwise, because competition will always arise to meet lucrative opportunity unless it is forcibly prohibited by a state actor, that's natural and economic law. 

Obtaining exclusive control by government intervention is not a defining characteristic of a monopoly. A monopoly is not defined as ""exclusive control of a commodity or service in a particular market because the government intervened on their behalf"", that is in no way what I've attempted to say at any point throughout this. It is a defining characteristic of the only environment in which monopolies can persist. Since it's obvious I have to spell it out for you. I at no point said, ""In order for a market participator to be considered a monopoly, it has to have the government intervene on its behalf."" What I did say was, ""Unless the government intervenes on behalf of a market participator, that participator will not be capable of becoming and persisting as a monopoly."" An entity with exclusive control will not maintain exclusive control unless it is capable of forcibly preventing new competitors, innovation, and market disruption. That's just a fact of life, history, and economic theory."	Economics	Economics	-1

302	"During the formation of sperm and egg cells, the mature cells will contain half of the genome (23 chromosomes) of the parent. If you still remember high school biology, homologous chromosomes will mix with each other. So your 17th chromosome you inherit from your father will be a mixture of both of his 17th chromosomes and not an exact copy of one if them. 

So, let's say that a gene that may contribute to  depression is separated by 1% of the chromosome from one of the markers they looked at. This marker would be associated with depression, while a marker on the opposite end of the chromosome would be far less likely to be linked to that gene when sampling a large number of individuals. It's important to remember that these types of studies are entirely correlations, and are completely incapable of estanlblishing causal links.

311	Stoicism. I find a lot of the ethics and virtue arguments practically the same. Most of the differences to me are semantic and of no value in terms of how it impacts my faith in God.	"Stephen Hawking indeed was a brilliant, accomplished man.  However, if you believe what he believed, that there is no God, then everything he ever accomplished was, in an ULTIMATE sense, meaningless.  He believed that you pass out of existence when you die, and that there is no God.  Therefore, eventually, when the universe dies out (heat death or the ""big rip""), none of his accomplishments will have any meaning.  They will all be for nothing, and there will virtually be nothing, just cold, unthinking dead stars and frozen planets, or perhaps the undoing of all matter, if the Big Rip theory is correct.  Really, if you work backwards with an atheistic worldview, there isn't anything right now either.  We may as well be dead matter that happens to be in a state of higher energy, with more material interactions taking place.  There is really no more life now then there would be after the heat death of the universe.  So, Mr. Hawking's entire worldview completely undermines the value of any life at present, and even undoes the entire meaning of life as we know it.

Now, Mr. Hawking was not philosophically consistent.  Here is what he said in an interview with The Guardian in 2011:

*Q: You've said there is no reason to invoke God to light the blue touchpaper. Is our existence all down to luck?*

*A: Science predicts that many different kinds of universe will be spontaneously created out of nothing. It is a matter of chance which we are in.*

*Q: So here we are. What should we do?*

*A: We should seek the greatest value of our action.*

So, Hawking says we should seek the greatest value of our action. However, his worldview undermines any basis for ultimate value or meaning. (note ""ultimate"" is a very important qualifier here - don't get tripped up)  He is not able to live consistently in his worldview, because he knows deep down that there is ultimate value in the universe, and he lived his life in pursuit of that ultimate value.

The value that Stephen Hawking pursued, though noble seeming, and indeed beneficial to the human race in many ways, was in the end also ""perishable"".  His crown of glory will perish, regardless of whether you hold the athiestic worldview or the Christian worldview.

*""1 Corinthians 9:24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. 25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.""*

So let Stephen Hawking's accomplishments and striving after perishable meaning and glory be a ""pointer"" for you, not an end to emulate.  He knew there was ultimate value, but he sought it in the wrong places.

Unfortunately, we have to face the hard truth.  Stephen Hawking rejected God and his son, Jesus Christ.  I say this frankly, and with no gladness: Stephen Hawking is not having a heart to heart with his creator at the moment.  He will not receive a glorified, resurrected body on the day that Christ returns in power.  He rejected God in this life, and he will not spend eternity with his creator.  This is the sad reality.  Let be a warning to everyone who has ears to hear.  The greatest accomplishments on earth will mean nothing on the day that we stand before God in judgement.  All that matters is this: did you receive and love the savior that God sent into the world - his own son Jesus Christ?"	Christianity	Christianity	-1

I believe in several powers higher than myself, but I don‚Äôt consider them anything akin to a god. 

I love climbing, so I‚Äôm kind of a mountain enthusiast, and I know something much greater than myself must have created the Sierra Nevadas or the Grand Teton mountain ranges. 

As an Atheist, I do have moments of spirituality, but not in the sense of some ethereal being within me. But rather just in the essence of what it is to be human, and to have the opportunity to stare up at the night sky and count the stars, or to be able to wake up in the morning and kiss the woman I love, or have two cats that I‚Äôve created an unspoken bond with.

I have all of these amazing things that, when I put into perspective, I am humbled and grateful for. But having something to be grateful for doesn‚Äôt require **someone** to be grateful toward. 

The force that created the Sierra Nevadas and Grand Teton mountains is called plate tectonics. 
The stars in the sky are the result of gravitational attraction. 
And the woman I can roll over and kiss right now was caused by evolution and reproduction. 

All of these things are powers beyond my control, and so much greater than myself. But they aren‚Äôt beyond my understanding or beyond natural world. And the great miracle of nature is that there are no miracles. 
There are no suspensions of its natural order in order to appease anyone.

If laymen and laywomen only follow each other and go to where everyone else is going, nothing‚Äôs going to get done. It‚Äôs textbook mob mentality. No one does anything because everyone‚Äôs waiting for someone else to do something.

If you can‚Äôt have a debate without leaving with a different point of view, then you‚Äôve failed to do your part. 

When two sides fail to just stfu and hear the ‚Äúyeah but‚Äù‚Äôs of the other side, then all you end up with is an amplification of what either side has collectively agreed to be the loudest (not necessarily the most correct) opinion or stance, and then that‚Äôs where you get to where we are now where both sides are operating on these simplified views where ‚Äúthe right doesn‚Äôt care about human rights and is only interested in taking more money from minorities because all people on the right are rich white people‚Äù and ‚Äúthe left only cares about feelings and accepting everyone and giving everyone all the free stuff because everyone on the left is a poor minority who just wants their feelings validated‚Äù

A byte will have a value ranging from 0 to 255 (when interpreted as an unsigned int), so we use that as the index in our array. The instruction never really finishes execution, however, during its partial execution in the CPU pipeline, the page we tried to access will be cached, and so if we figure out which page has been cached, we can figure out the value of the protected byte.

Because the Catholic church says that premarital and extramarital sex are absolutely verboten under all circumstances, it stands to reason that if you're not married, you're not having sex, and so the two ideas became conflated, and ""celibate"" came to mean, to many people, not having sex.

I have to admit I'm not the most regular player but i still have around 1500h of gameplay which is quite a bit of time i feel like. I first of started as a pve player, doing dungeons regularly, then fractals when they came out. I tried to get full ascended on my then main (a necro that i used to play tank/support) but i can't seem able to keep the same goal for too long so once i got about full ascended trinkets, one armor and ascended staff and focus, i started focusing on living world stories (when the season 3 of LW started). My mesmer became my main (and is still is).

 About six months ago i started doing a lot of WvW, i wanted to get legendary armor for my mesmer (because I always want to try out a new build but I never manage to get enough gold to be able to change of build, and I've never been a huge PVP player so I tend not to try new builds there, I still am and will ever be a PVE player). 

After getting from rank 50 to around 220 in a short period of time (2 or 3 months) i got a bit tired of it so I turned to PVP for the first time. I got to low gold (despite since how long i've been playing I'm not very good at this game but i play to enjoy, not being good so I've never been bothered too much by that) but I couldn't really play lately (I was on vacations) so I got degraded to bronze.

But, thank you for the dismissiveness, it really added a lot. 	I was 20 when I lost my virginity.  I was overweight and shy.  I had lots of guy friends, but no one wanted to date me.  One of my friends brought home a buddy of his from the Marines and we hit it off great. He was so good looking. He paid so much attention to me that night, and made me feel so attractive.  I remember thinking that a person like him shouldn't even be paying attention to someone ugly and disgusting like me.  I figured, it won't get better than this, at least I can have this one night.

The thing is, you have no money either. You have no money, no sanity left, and too much compassion. You cannot keep housing her. Especially if you need this to file the divorce. You say you are not a monster and won't kick her out BUT months of free rent, utilities, etc. Is a LOT to give someone. You're a saint if you do this - no, you're a martyr. You're sacrificing a LOT to do this.

Does staying in a separate bedroom under the same roof count as living separate? Research the laws in your area.

How long is the lease? Can you get your name or hers off it? If you can get hers off it, do so ASAP. You can help her find a temp place to stay, a couch/closet that's really cheap and offer to loan her money. With written contract. Speak to your landlord and discuss your issues. See if you could get them to be on board. They can rescind the lease and offer a new one with only one person's name on it. Your lease agreement is your proof of where you're staying for the next while so the names on it are important.

Otherwise, I suggest you find a new place to rent ASAP. If your friends wont let you live somewhere rent-free, maybe rent out a couch and a corner of their fridge. Before the lease is up, try to stay away from her as much as possible. Spend time at a cafe or library, etc. Cut off things you dont need at the place (cable, internet if you're going to be gone all day at a library or cafe) to save money. And then sleep on the couch. Remember that by doing this, you're essentially freely handing her the amount of rent for however much time your lease is. That's a lot to give. Don't incredibly recommend this if you can avoid it.

389	"&gt; yeah, when I use your calculator, saving $10-$30 per month gives you $18k to $55k at age 65 for 5% rate of return and 3% inflation. How did you get $850k? That's an insanely high number and makes no sense.

A: It's not my calculator. It's not my argument. 

B: The linked article tells you how the $850k number can be reached, and in that context it isn't an unreasonable number.

&gt; Your numbers assume a 7% rate of return if you put it all into index funds...which are a high risk. 

Not my assumptions, not my argument, not my risk assessment. But you've answered your own question about where the $850k number came from. So, you understand how compounding interest can turn ~$175/mo into about $1,000,000 over 45 years. I'm not sure why you're taking this position that you simultaneously understand the math, and also think that the result is somehow ridiculously incomprehensible.

If the above OP has NetFlix, that's $10/m, Hulu, $10/mo, Internet $75/mo, Cable television $100/mo, that's easily over $175/mo. Their assumption is that they're spending $42,500/decade, $4,250/yr, $350/mo on discretionary entertainment, so cutting $175/mo out of that shouldn't be difficult.

&gt; The stock market could crash at age 65 and it take 10 years to recover your value, by then you could be dead.

Bad luck happens. The 7%-8% return is the average. It takes good and bad years into account. This isn't a recommendation on how to manage your retirement portfolio, this is a simple exercise to describe how a small amount of savings can pay off over 45 years of working.

Something to add, though, from that post I'm referring to:

&gt; Def was passed down normally, but Special had a 50% chance to be either the same as the parent, or the parent's +/- 8 (depending on the parent's IV, if the parent had a low Special, it would be boosted in the child, and weakened if the parent had a high special)

Which means that a Pokemon in the Shiny Family may have gotten the +/-8 Special instead, which halves the chances of further children being Shiny, and makes it so its children have a chance to not even be in the Shiny Family at all. So if, for example, you're going for Scyther, there's a large chance that if you don't breed any of the intermediate parents as Shiny, the Scyther may have a 0% chance of being Shiny. You'd have to check the DVs in a calculator.

398	"Hi Oliver,

I haven't been able to get an explicit answer about this, so I figured I'd ask you directly. I've read a few of your posts and most of the questions aren't exactly my situation.

So here it is:

I am a non-married American citizen. I work (as a ""full-time"" / non-contractor in tech) in PA for a company based out of that state. I have the ability to work remotely indefinitely. I was wondering if I would be eligible for the FEIE if I were to leave the US and bounce around the world (think 3 months EU, a month in UK, month in Ireland, month in Croatia, repeat) while maintaining the same job. By the time I had in mind to do this, I would have no apartment or house (lease would be up), and I might have a storage unit to keep my things for an eventual return. I would spend over 330 days overseas (goal of 2-3 years) during that time.

If I were eligible, is there anything I'd need to do to prove it or to improve my eligibility? What kinds of forms would I have to fill out for my taxes? For the first tax exemption, would I want to leave as close to January 1st as possible (or before of course) so I could have a full fiscal year out of the country and have no issues with overlap?

Thank you so much! This thought / fantasy has been on my mind for quite some time. I'd love to get an answer to it."	"I'll have to correct you on a couple of things here:

399	"&gt; superiority of non-hygienic macros is obvious

Maybe - MAYBE - outside of scheme and descendants, including racket. Schemes claim to be ""fully lexically scoped."" This applies not only to variables and functions resolution but also to the language's keywords. You can shadow if, let, lambda, define; whatever you want. This is great for making custom or restricted languages, and since you can shadow anything it's important that macros defined in a certain context retain that when expanded, and that the expansion of the macro not interfere with its arguments.

However, even without the necessity of hygiene imposed by scheme's extreme lexical scoping rules, I think that hygiene is still a desirable property. Being able to write and use macros without caring about the implementation or the usage is really nice.

And the choice is not between syntax-rules (only hygienic) and defmacro (unhygienic).

403	"Throwaway account here.

I share App accounts on our phones with my husband and saw some strange apps downloaded to my phone. I sneaked a look at his phone and discovered evidence of cheating (or at least, intention to cheat) and then confronted him.

We had a long and emotional talk. He admitted to cheating with more than one woman, and even a couple. He apologized and accepted responsibility. He said that the next step is up to me: We could divorce and he would try to work with me to have an amicable separation with joint custody, or we could stay officially married so I stay supported and maintain my health insurance, house, etc. We have two children, 7 and 4. I stay at home while our income and insurance comes from his work.

I suggested counseling. He said that though he cares for me greatly, he doesn't see our relationship ever being the same again, refused counseling, and said that he's 'not suited for monogamy.' He said he has no intention of ever marrying again and doesn't mind staying married to me on paper. He would prefer this, so the kids can have a single home.

The part that hurts the most is that we've had a seemingly happy and normal relationship until I found all this out. It was such a complete shock and surprise and I feel like such a fool. We had a fun home life, good sex life, he's a good father, we'd go out together and laugh . . .

I'm not sure what I should do. Any advice would be appreciated.

In hindsight I was not the ‚Äòrock‚Äô she wanted and saw her friends as bad influences where as to her they were closer than family(both of us were right).

She got baby fever after her nephew was born. I said no as we were both 23 with no career.

I did other things that caused her to lose attraction; she found it in what I can politely describe as a dirtbag.

She asked for ‚Äòspace‚Äô, I visited her on Valentine‚Äôs Day because she was sick.

I saw the texts.

She defended herself by saying we were on a break(not the term she told me).

With the majority of the major 2018 flagships having been announced or released, and with the recent Pixel 3 leaks, I thought it would be time to share what my Perfect Pixel 3 would be. Although, the actual Pixel 3 is high unlikely to be like this.

## Display:
- 5.48 inch, 18:9 AMOLED display
- 10 Bit display
- Resolution: 2160x1080
- Effectively 5.0 inch, 16:9 display with additional height 
- 5.48 inch screen with small bezels should allow for comfortable one handed use
2160x1080 resolution, offers ~441ppi at 5.48 inches. A higher resolution wouldn‚Äôt be beneficial, due to increased power consumption due to voltage being applied to greater number of pixels and the GPU running at a higher frequency.
- Variable refresh rate up to 120Hz
- Pressure Sensitive Display
- Assertive Display - uses tone mapping to make elements of the display more 
visible when under intense light

In order for a device to be Daydream compliant it requires the device to have a low response time, which is not possible with an LCD display. OLEDs have the advantages of true blacks, theoretical infinite contrast and lower power consumption when displaying darker colours when  compared to LCD displays. They, however, have the disadvantages of consuming more power when displaying lighter colours, and pixel degradation/burn in caused by the organic compounds 
that make up the subpixels breaking down - this is especially notable with the blue subpixels as more energy is required for them to be at an equal brightness to the red and green subpixels; this is why pentile displays are used. Samsung‚Äôs AMOLED displays have been proven to be superior to their LG P-OLED counterparts, which is why they will be used.

If Quantum Dot LED displays are available, they will be used instead. QD-LED 
displays are similar to OLED displays but use Quantum Dots instead of organic 
compounds for the subpixels. This means that they have the the advantages of 
OLED displays, without the worry of burn in or pixel degradation, this also has 
the additional benefit of the display not having to be pentile. 

If microLED displays are available, they will be used instead. microLED displays are similar to OLED displays but use GaN (Gallium Nitride) instead of organic compounds for the subpixels. This means that they have the the advantages of OLED displays, without the worry of burn in or pixel degradation; while also offering a higher Lux/W and the additional benefit of the display not having to be pentile. 

XL Variant:

- 6.25 inch, 18:9 display using the same display technology and features
- Resolution: 2880x1440
- Effectively 5.7 inch, 16:9 display with additional height 

&amp;nbsp; 

## Camera:
Cameras are a key part of the smartphone experience. With the current Pixels, the primary rear camera hardware setup is very similar to the competition. Google‚Äôs software has allowed their current Pixels to become some of the best mobile cameras. With the next generation of Pixels, Google should try create a camera experience that is truly beyond its competitors by adopting and evolving the technology that is used by its competitors.

### Rear Facing
Tri Camera Setup

*First Camera:*

- 12.3MP (~1.7 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with 
LPDDR4X DRAM
- RGB
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Second Camera:*

- 12.3MP (1.25 micron) 1/2.9 inch 10 Bit - 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with
 LPDDR4X DRAM
- RGB
- f/2.4 aperture
- Telephoto Lens: 2x Zoom
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Third Camera:*

- 12.3MP (~1.7 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with 
LPDDR4X DRAM
- Monochrome
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

This tri camera setup allows for ‚Äúoptical‚Äù zoom, depth perception, ARCore support 
and better low light performance. 

- 9 RGB LED Ring Flash
- Record 720p videos at 960 fps
- Record 1080p videos at 480 fps
- Record 4K videos at 120 fps 
- Deep Trench Isolation (e.g. Samsung Isocell)
- Dual Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus 
- IR Laser Autofocus 
- Contrast Detection Autofocus
- RGBC IR Sensor (e.g. Sony Xperia XZ)
- Support for Camera2 API
- HDR+
- IR Laser Autofocus and 9 RGB LEDs will be implemented in a similar way to the 
[Meizu Pro 6](http://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9649269988/meizu1.jpg)

The resolution is kept the same as the Pixel 2, while the sensor size is slightly increased for the non zoom cameras and OIS is added, further improving the low light capabilities. These sensors are also 10 bit granting the ability for a wider colour gamut to be captured when compared to the more standard 8 bit cameras.

The main RGB 12MP and Monochrome 12MP cameras will be used in conjunction and take advantage of algorithms that replicate the behaviour of cones and rods in the human eye to improve low light performance. 

A Hybrid Autofocus system is more versatile than an autofocus system that is just passive or just active. The combination of Hybrid Autofocus System and multiple camera sensors will allow for more depth information to be captured, used in conjunction with Google‚Äôs pre-existing [algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html) will dramatically improve portrait mode capabilities. 

The RGBC IR Sensor is used to determine an accurate white balance, and the 9 RGB LED Ring flash can be used to adjust the white balance of the scene or improve general flash performance compared to the more standard two-tone LED flash.

The cameras will be positioned in the top left on the back of the phone similar to the current Pixel, the reason for this positioning is that reduces the likelihood of a finger obstructing the cameras when in use. They will have a layout similar to the [leaked LG V30 render](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DA1ZtyFXoAAwi9x.jpg), with quadrants 1,2,3 being the cameras, quadrant 4 being the IR Laser Autofocus and 
9 RGB LEDs, and the RGBC IR Sensor being in the center of them.

### Front Facing:
Dual 8.3MP (1.5 micron) 1/3 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with LPDDR4X DRAM

*First Camera:*

- RGB
- f/1.7 Aperture
- 6 Element Lens
- Glass Lens for 1st Element
- Wide Angle Lens
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Second Camera:*

- Monochrome
- f/1.7 Aperture
- 6 Element Lens
- Glass Lens for 1st Element
- Wide Angle Lens
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

RGB 8MP and Monochrome 8MP cameras will be used in conjunction and take advantage of [algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html) that replicate the behaviour of cones and rods in the human eye to improve low light performance.

- Deep Trench Isolation (e.g. Samsung Isocell)
- Dual Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus 
- Contrast Detection Autofocus
- IR Laser Autofocus
- RGBC IR Sensor (e.g. Sony Xperia XZ)
- 3 RGB LED Flash
- Record 720p videos at 960 fps
- Record 1080p videos at 480 fps
- Record 4K videos at 120 fps
- Support for Camera2 API
- HDR+

## SoC:
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 
or
Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9810
(whichever has a higher performance/watt)

Ideally, I would like to see Google design a SoC with a 
[RISC-V](https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1328561) based CPU, built on a current generation fabrication process, with performance that is competitive with the current generation of Apple A series SoCs. By designing a RISC-V CPU, Google would not need to pay licensing fees for the CPU architecture, it would also allow Google to reduce the dependence that Android devices have on ARM. The Pixel Visual Core would be able to be directly integrated into the SoC instead of being a discrete chip and could be combined with a custom designed ISP, further improving performance, reducing power consumption and reducing processing time for the camera. Google could also incorporate their TPU technology, allowing for better on device machine learning. Another possible benefit, is that Google could open source the drivers for the SoC. Obviously this isn't a task that can simply just happen, it would require Google to invest a lot in R&amp;D, as well as a team of highly skilled Engineers and Computer Scientists.

&amp;nbsp;

## RAM:

8GB LPDDR4X RAM

Having more RAM will reduce the average memory access time. This means an overall reduction in time taken to access data when traversing down the memory hierarchy. LPDDR4X consumes less power than LPDDR4.

&amp;nbsp;

## Build:

2.5d Gorilla Glass 5 screen - Less scratch resistant than other versions of 
Gorilla Glass, however it is more shatter resistant

With Google‚Äôs 2017 hardware lineup, Google has developed a unique two tone designaesthetic. The panels on the current Pixels are a point of vulnerability due to being made of glass, so they will be made of high quality plastic instead. 

7000 series Aluminium Alloy frame (anodised, sandblasted finish)  with high quality two tone plastic back. Plastic won‚Äôt shatter like glass or ceramic (both brittle materials).

IP68 Dust and Water Resistance

~20mm total vertical bezel due to the size of front facing cameras and the bezels being symmetrical. In comparison the Samsung Galaxy S8, which has a smaller front facing camera and doesn‚Äôt have front facing speakers has a total of 16.4mm vertical bezels

~4mm total horizontal bezel

- ~ 9.0mm thickness, so cameras are flush
- ~ 66.3mm 
- ~ 144.6mm
 
XL Variant:

- ~ 9.0mm thickness so cameras are flush
- ~ 75mm 
- ~ 162mm

Both models have ~83% screen to body ratio

&amp;nbsp;

## Speakers: 
2 stereo front facing speakers 

Dolby Atmos support

&amp;nbsp;

## Button and Port Placement:
Volume and Power buttons should be on opposite sides of the phone - this means that user won‚Äôt be able to mistake the power and volume buttons for each other (e.g Samsung Galaxy S/Note series, iPhone 6/7)

2 stage shutter button, placed lower down on the same side as the power button. It will be possible for this button to be remappable

3.5mm Headphone jack should be on the bottom left of the phone. Removing it with the Pixel 2 was user hostile.

USB 3.2 Type C Connector centered at the bottom of the phone.

In-display fingerprint sensor 

&amp;nbsp;

## Battery:
- 3200 mAh battery

XL Variant:

- 3900 mAh battery

It would be more interesting to see the phone run  a release version of Fuchsia OS - an OS built from the ground up, designed with the intent of running only on modern platforms - combined with a custom SoC implementation, that was designed in conjunction with the OS

## Alternate Rear Camera Take:
The best camera is always the camera that is on you.  For the vast majority of people, smartphones are their primary camera. In the past 2 years we have seen camera performance generally stagnate, with a few exceptions.  

Better software has allowed companies to push their camera to their limits,  and with machine learning algorithms being employed, improvements will be  seen as the training datasets are grown and the models are tweaked. 

Hardware, however will continue to remain a limiter on the RAW  performance of a camera. A simple way of improving a camera would be increasing the sensor size, however in the volume constraint  smartphone this presents an issue, as aperture size will have to be decreased to prevent an increase in z-axis height. 

To overcome this, some manufacturers have instead used additional camera sensors, allowing for the capture of more photons (data). These multi-camera implementations vary, with some using a lower resolution second camera to just gather depth information (arguably the least useful implementation), some use a secondary monochrome camera to improve low light performance, and others even using a secondary camera with a telephoto lens to allow for ‚Äúoptical‚Äù zoom. With these setups, the addition of more sensors will allow for greater RAW performance. It is important to take into account what type of use the additional camera provides

An approach that has been taken by Nokia and Huawei, is the use of a relatively larger sensor with a notably larger resolution. The increase in resolution may cause an decrease in the signal to noise ratio, presenting an issue in low light photography, however this is dealt with through the use pixel binning, where 4 adjacent pixels are essentially combined to create 1 larger pixel. The higher resolution is advantageous in well-lit conditions as it allows for cropping (providing a useful digital zoom). Compared to the use of a telephoto camera, this allows for a greater level of zoom, with the standard trade-off of worse low light performance, due to the smaller pixels found in these high resolution sensors.

To determine the colours in a scene, a sensor needs a method in which to distinguish between colours.  The vast majority of digital camera sensors achieve this with the [Bayer filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter) which divides each pixel into 4 subpixels Blue, Green, Green, Red.

This proposed take on a camera is inspired by the different techniques of various smartphone manufacturers.

### Rear Facing:
Quad Camera Setup

- 49.2MP (~0.85 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with LPDDR4X DRAM
- Green
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Third Camera:*

- 49.2MP (~0.85 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with LPDDR4X DRAM
- Green
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)

*Fourth Camera:*

- 49.2MP (~0.85 micron) 1/2 inch 10 Bit 3-layer Stacked CMOS Image sensors with LPDDR4X DRAM
- Red
- Adjustable f/1.7 or f/2.4 aperture
- 6 element lens
- Glass lens for 1st element
- OIS (5 axis gyroscope up to 1.7 degrees freedom of movement)


*Additional:*

- 9 RGB LED Ring Flash
- Record 720p videos at 960 fps
- Record 1080p videos at 480 fps
- Record 4K videos at 120 fps 
- Deep Trench Isolation 
- Dual Pixel Phase Detection Autofocus 
- IR Laser Autofocus 
- Contrast Detection Autofocus
- RGBC IR Sensor 
- Support for Camera2 API
- HDR+
- IR Laser Autofocus and 9 RGB LEDs will be implemented in a similar way to the [Meizu Pro 6](http://www.dpreview.com/files/p/articles/9649269988/meizu1.jpg)
 
4 larger single colour sensors are used with a resolution that is 4x greater than 12.3MP.  Single colours used are BGGR - arranged like a [Bayer filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter) - allowing for the 4 sensors combined to effectively be RGB 49.2MP (~1.7 micron) sensor. This high resolution and pixel size allows for ‚Äú4x zoom‚Äù at 12.3MP in a variety of lighting conditions. Pixel binning can also be used, to effectively create a RGB 12.3MP (~3.4 micron) sensor, significantly improving low light performance. 5 axis OIS is added to each sensor improving the low light capabilities.  If used in conjunction with [Google‚Äôs HDR+ algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/10/hdr-low-light-and-high-dynamic-range.html) camera performance will even further be improved. In most situations the default resolution can be set to 49.2MP, while in extremely low light scenarios it can be automatically adjusted to 12.3MP 

A Hybrid Autofocus system is more versatile than an autofocus system that is just passive or just active. The combination of Hybrid Autofocus System and multiple camera sensors will allow for more depth information to be captured, used in conjunction with Google‚Äôs pre-existing [algorithms](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/10/portrait-mode-on-pixel-2-and-pixel-2-xl.html) will dramatically improve portrait mode capabilities. 

The RGBC IR Sensor is used to determine an accurate white balance. The cameras will be positioned in the top left on the back of the phone similar to the current Pixel, the reason for this positioning is that reduces the likelihood of a finger obstructing the cameras when in use. 

## Trade-Offs:
While this proposed solution may have some benefits, it still has trade-offs, although the use of multiple sensors requires less z-axis height compared to a single large sensor, it will still take up notable volume. It will also increase the price of a smartphone. Software will also be required to ensure the images captured from each sensor are correctly aligned, which may present an issue when capturing fast moving objects.

427	"&gt; So this is something that never quite made sense to me. Looking at the roster for these teams the vast majority aren't from Toronto (are any?) and many aren't even Canadian.

You're correct, there are many players not from the city, but it's not entirely about that.  It's a shared connection with others in the city.  You go to a random social event and odds are, those that like baseball specifically root for the Blue Jays, so it's something you have in common right away.  Also - and this is a huge part of it - they play their games in your city, so you are going to the games surrounded almost exclusively by other fans of the same team.

Plus, there's the consistency of it.  I'm a Toronto Blue Jays fan, my Dad's a Blue Jays fan, the next generation will likely be Blue Jays fans.  When they win, everyone around me is happy, and it's something that you watch grow and change from year-to-year with the constant being that they're a part of the city, even if many of the players didn't originate here.

&gt; If an esports team were called the Toronto Titans, would you suddenly feel affinity towards them? Maybe not immediately, but what about after a few years?

It depends, but it would be a start.  If they were called the Toronto Titans and they participated in tournaments exclusively in the States, then no.  They actually have to host events here for it to matter.  If I have no opportunity to ever actually see them, if they don't physically play in Toronto at least some of the time, then it's not the same.  The fact that the Maple Leafs, Blue Jays, etc actually physically play games in Toronto is a big part of that connection to the city."

433	"A few points from the Catholic perspective.

1. The material universe is like a dream and God is the dreamer. He didn't merely start the universe and then abandon it to its own devices: he is keeping it in existence perpetually and the universe needs God to exist.

2. Humans are a unique creature in the material universe. They have free will and their choices matter.

3. Think of the period from the start of the universe until the apocalypse as ""phase 1."" The point of phase 1 for us humans is for us to choose which side we're on: are we on God's side or not. The existence of evil in phase 1 makes it shitty but it isn't designed to last forever. You want God to make phase 1 better and get rid of evil and all that and you think that's his job, but a Catholic would say that you're thinking of it wrong. What your primary concern should be is if you're living a morally good life: ""and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.‚Äô  The second is this, ‚ÄòYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment greater than these."" *‚ÄîMark 12:30-31* There is more to it than these two commandments but it's the gist of what we humans should be concerned about with while we're alive here in this universe. So you do your part in living a morally good life and if everyone else did their's then the world would probably be a way better place, but ultimately, the world becoming a better place isn't what matters in the end: what matters in the end is if you chose to be on the right side when you die."

- So until last August I was living with my sister in a house.  
- A piece of mail containing her renewed license to practice her profession was delivered to my house around Jan 1 (there's a on Jan 1 from me to her telling her I got it).  
- She lives about 10-15 minutes away from my house now.  
- She has a very high stress job, is in charge of a lot of people's care, does not have much free time, and is usually really tired at night.
- We had plans on Jan 19th to see each other and she asked me a few days prior if I could bring her license with me.  I looked for it that morning for about 10 minutes before I left the house but was not able to find it.
- I let her know that I couldn't find it and I would look again.  I asked her if there was a way to have it resent.  She said there was but it would cost $30.
- Currently I am a graduate student and working part-time (roughly 30-40k) -- obviously I don't have much expendable income.

The license is a badge of honor and a point of evidence for all the work I went though and continue to do.  I get excited every time I get a new one. And then like I mentioned-it‚Äôs expensive and an annoying process to renew (have to prove 60 Hours of continuing ed etc). I just want to tell you that bc you‚Äôve asked me To be vulnerable with you in the past about my reactions and I‚Äôm currently feeling pretty unseen and unimportant. And I did tell you when you got it that it was important and it doesn‚Äôt feel like it was treated as important. And I do know mistakes happen



ME:

mmmm.  [sister's name] i'm really sorry!  i didn't realize you were feeling unseen and unimportant.  i know you work hard and put a lot into what you do.  and the license represents that.  you did tell me it was important but i'm not sure i was able to grasp the full scope of that from what you'd said.  i appreciate you being vulnerable with me.  i just dropped off [girlfriend's name] at [somewhere] and am heading home now where i plan to do a full search.  
    i think i do feel a bit punished by having to pay for it.  i think that's a bit hard especially because you make a lot more money than i do right now.  so it feels more severe than it would normally.  i want to contribute to helping replace it if it's lost though.  i guess from where i stand it does feel like we are both in some way responsible for this outcome too.  but i don't want you to hear me not recognizing the importance of what the license means to you.  i see and hear you in that.  i'm just not sure if me paying for it feels totally fair if i'm honest



SISTER: 

Thank you. So out of curiosity-what do you see as my responsibility in it?
    Also I‚Äôm curious about why it feels like a punishment. To me it‚Äôs honoring the relationship between two equals and owning up to having lost something of value to another. 


ME: 

i feel hesitant to express my feelings because i don't want the impact to be that you feel minimized or unseen.  i want you to know that i'm hearing and seeing you in this


ME:
    so normally in life when one moves and something important is sent to a previous address, that's a mistake that the moving person would have to rectify.  it just so happens your brother lives at your previous address.  and while i did misplace it, that first error is your responsibility.  i also told you about it three weeks ago and you didn't mention anything about it until a few days ago.  it was laying around for a couple weeks on the bookcase and at some point it must have gotten cleaned up or something.  so, i'm willing to take responsibility that i lost a piece of your mail and help you out in getting it resent.  i know that it happens to be of particular importance to you.  but that's how i see it.

The report from the Fraunhofer Institute is precisely the one I was referring to, where the rifle was tested under lab conditions that it was never designed for and that would really only occur in freak circumstances or if you deliberately misuse the gun. Similarly, the 7% accuracy figure is a question of weighting outliers in the shot placement and the method they applied is much stricter than you would commonly rate groupings when shooting.

The original Afghanistan account was, as far as I remember it, of one instance where soldiers were cornered and had no choice but to use their weapons for continuous covering fire in order to bug out and as everybody expected, the rifles hit the crapper and had to be returned for maintenance afterwards. 

Unfortunately, it came at a convenient time for Ursula von der Leyen, then-defense-secretary, to get into the papers once more. 
The whole stunt earned her the nickname ""Flinten-Uschi"" (a slightly derogatory pun on old-timey guns and her first name) and lost her the respect of even those serving members of the Bundeswehr who still had some after all the other shit she pulled."

It prevents all kinds of poverty traps and directly fixes the problem of poverty that we created using monopolism and state controls.

When looking at average income per person in Australia it's about almost 79k for a full time employee before bonuses. (http://www.abs.gov.au). 

Where as in Canada it's more like 52k.  (http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/171130/dq171130b-eng.htm).

It also paints a different picture when looking at minumum wage living in Canada where minmum wage ranges from $10.96-$14.00 an hour. Where as in Australia it's  $17.70/hour which very few jobs except the banana farms pay. Even McDonald's is paying $20+ an hour plus superannuation (which no company in Canada is required to pay). 

On top of this post secondary is subsidised for 90% of students and any loans that are taken out don't need to be paid back until you make 52k per year.

I get the feeling he was working through a lot of real-life issues during its writing and it shows in the book.	"And this is why I never finished *The Wheel of Time*.  I could never get into *Knife of Dreams* (book 11), and by the time Sanderson came in and released *The Gathering Storm* (book 12), it'd been 6 years since I really read any of it.

So I started over, and got stuck somewhere around *Path of Daggers*.  Since then I've tried re-reading the series several times (in fact, I'm just about done with *Eye of the World* right now).  But I've never been able to finish it.

Personally, I believe communication is KEY, talk to them, openly, about everything...don't chastise them or you will make them uncomfortable and afraid to come to you to ask for help, or tell you how they're feeling or what they're doing. Your kids need to be able to trust you, to feel that they can talk to you about anything,and it being ok. As for myself, I was raised right, my parents were kinda poor when I was younger, but I wasn't abused or neglected or raped or anything of that nature. I was just introverted and socially awkward and prone to anxiety attacks, and when I realized the drugs alleviated all of that, made me confident and outgoing and quick witted, I fell in love, HARD. Maybe had my parents asked me about it, and got involved as opposed to ignoring my drug use like they did, maybe I could have seen a doctor and been put on medication to straighten me out, instead of self medicating with Oxycontin, heroin, Xanax and whatever else I could get my hands on at the moment.

"I don't think you're an asshole for asking him to get his shit together, though if you literally said ""step it up"" that is kind of rude, no matter how warranted.

Nor do I think you're an asshole for bringing this to the teacher to ask that they be removed from your group. Or the principal for his terrible response. 

That said, how far off is this performance? Because, surely, you've had some inkling before now that they are not prepared? That they haven't been practicing or keeping pace with the progress of the other team members? If you've been keeping quiet and just letting them do their own thing without any encouragement or good faith attempts to get them to participate, and have been planning in the back of your mind for some time to kick them out days before the performance, that is bordering on asshole behavior.

It's not your job to babysit or force these students to do stuff. But frequently, the ""unspoken lesson"" in group projects is that it's a team building exercise, and a lesson in how to work with others (however unwilling they may be.) Open communication earlier in the term would have been key so that your teacher could guide you (or step in if warranted.) You should be prepared to answer some possibly tough questions about why you waited until now to make the teacher aware of their behavior, past the point of the teacher being able to do anything about it if they were so inclined. At the very least, there would have been some documentation that they were being little shits, and could have taken that into account when grading the group if they are more hands-off.

Maybe you really were trying to give these folks space in the hopes that they'd get it together and didn't realize until it was too late that that wouldn't happen. But you have to know going in that there is a real possibility that from the teacher's point of view, and to anyone else on the outside looking in, that it might appear that you just sat on your hands and purposely didn't do anything so that they could fall flat on their faces.

533	"On the dress shirt:

I'll have someone measure me (either at home or when I stop by BB again), and see what it comes up with.

If my recollection serves me right, the other fits for 17"" collar don't really help with the shoulder seam relative to my natural shoulder line. And if the other cuts are more generous in torso proportions, wouldn't that also mean the shoulders of the shirt would be wider, exacerbating the problem?

If for some reason the ""boxier"" cuts have narrower shoulders at the 17"" collar size, then the tailoring the shirts seems like a good option. Is the standard procedure there to pay ~$20 per shirt and have them darted?

On the Pants:

Yes, they pull a little bit on the crotch and there is a very slight flare on the pockets. The more relaxed fit, the ""hudson,"" seemed like it had too much material and that the legs were too wide. Would going up 2"" in the waist size and staying with the slimmer Clark fit be a good idea?

539	"I prefer the individual DLC purchases myself. The additional bonuses of a season pass don't appeal to me; I don't really care about cosmetics so I don't need loot boxes/skins/virtual currency incentives.

I just want the game and the maps. The season pass might seem like a discount, but I'm rarely the kind of player who invests a full year into a game. I'll give it a few months, maybe a revisit shortly after, then I'll be done and never go back. Not because I hate the game, but because I have so much other stuff to do, other games to play, and I never get around to completing all that additional content.

Good anecdotal example is Saints Row 3. I played and loved the first game, and got the season pass. I played the first drop of season pass content and was satisfied with that. So far so good. But by the time the second pack came around, we were six months out from the game's release, and I had just grown the inevitable natural fatigue that comes with any consumed media. I barely touched the second season pass update, and sat out on the rest. I did not get my money's worth, and only felt like playing the second pack out of arbitrary obligation. Again, I don't hate Saints Row, it's one of my favorite games, but as someone who doesn't play one game (even a favorite) for several months on end anymore, I would have been better off just purchasing the DLC a la carte as they released.

I've always felt this way about every season pass I purchase. Yes I got more content at a lower price, but it's more content than I have the time or will to consume from a single game. It's like getting a 20 piece McNuggets, but only being able to enjoyably eat 12. Yes I did get those nuggets at a bulk discount, but I would have been perfectly satisfied with just ordering 2 6-piece McNuggets instead, and every nugget afterward feels less like eating for pleasure and more like an obligation.

Edit:  
All that being said, where was it confirmed that all DLC content will be locked behind the season pass? Honestly asking. Haven't been following this CoD too closely. The only official word I've seen is that there's a season pass in the pre-order bundle, and that they'll be releasing DLC content more frequently. This seems like the Modern Warfare 3 release model which released individual maps every month through the Elite season pass, then every three months released those maps in a map pack. The individual map DLC's were never available for pre-order in the past. Am I missing something?"	Yes, and they describe it as a Doom clone and group it alongside games like Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Dark Forces. It's a very dishonest video.	Games	Games	-1
540	"1. I think its about 99 percent certain at this point that Eren ate his dad. As far as why his dad passed it on to Eren, I‚Äôm assuming he knew this attack by the other shifters was coming. Maybe he wanted to hide the power away in Eren, or maybe Eren being younger, and eventually fitter, gives him a more powerful Titan form and gives the people in the walls a better chance? Also, and sorry to go off on a tangent, I take it we can confirm that Titans were created by a serum invented by humans. And humans probably created Titan shifting powers too? Ymir was probably injected with this serum, and maybe injury is the trigger to transforming into a regular Titan just like Titan shifters, that‚Äôs why they pushed her off their own respective wall and it caused her to transform.

2. I don‚Äôt know if the plan is to give Historia Eren‚Äôs Titan power, but almost certainly the plan is to give it to someone else, maybe the fraud king? Or Kenny will try to take it? After all, he did ominously tell Levi he‚Äôs done everything to pursue his ‚Äúdream‚Äù. Honestly I‚Äôm just annoyed Eren is kidnapped again, seems to be the theme of every season.

3. I think his fragmented memory of his father injecting him has something to do with memory loss when he became a Titan, like how Ymir doesn‚Äôt remember eating Reiner and Bertolt‚Äôs friend. As far as Erens dream at the beginning of the show, yeah wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if this memory manipulation has something to do with that.

Brownies from the local shop? 20mg (double dose) nothing noteworthy. 20mg of a Buddha bar and I can feel my face melting and that I desperately want to get off Mr Bones wild ride.	"Obligatory ""This actually happened several years ago"".

So I'm a medical student and a few years ago, I was studying for STEP 1 (the first part of our medical board exams). Basically, I was studying every day for 12-14 hours at a shot - doesn't that sound like fun! - I would typically wake up around 6:00, go to a local coffee shop with a friend, and then study there till 8 or 10pm. It was a simpler time, full of stress, coffee, and ridiculous amounts of computer time doing practice questions with short reddit/imgur breaks to attempt to maintain my sanity.


Anyway, I had been taking extended release Ritalin for a few years by then, but I had recently switched health insurance policies and the pharmacy had given me a generic prescription instead of the name brand. I had just finished my old prescription a few days ago, and my new prescription was small round red pills instead of the white cylindrical ones that I had been on. This was the beginning of my undoing.

The morning of my FU, I wake up, groggily reach over to grab my stuffed animal frog with a zipper mouth that I keep my various meds in (if you've ever watched Naruto, my drug storing frog is basically like his frog wallet - and yes, I am an adult male, don't judge me please). I pull out a pill bottle and pop a little red pill into my mouth before showering and heading to the coffee shop. On the way there, I notice that I don't really seem to feel as awake as usual but I just brush it off as being tired from studying all day every day for several months at this point. When I get there, I grab a cup of coffee, find my study buddy  and start working on practice questions. A few minutes in, I realize something is wrong because I'm reading a question about the mechanism of action of some antibiotic and I break out into uncontrollable laughter. My friend looks over at me and asks me if everything is alright, and I try to explain why the question is so funny but in my drug addled state, I still realize that something is wrong because there really isn't anything that funny about cell wall inhibitors. He gets scared that something is wrong or I'm having a nervous breakdown (to be fair, at that point, we were probably both fairly close to the breaking point just from the stress of studying). He starts asking me if everything is ok and I just sit there with this stupid grin on my face giggling. After about 10 minutes of my poor friend worriedly trying to figure out what's going on, a lightbulb goes off in my head and I realize that I may have taken the wrong little red pill. Turns out Ambien looks a lot like generic Ritalin. Way back when I started taking Ritalin, my doctor had given me a prescription for Ambien to help with insomnia that happens when you start taking stimulants. I have the gift of sleep (I can fall asleep anywhere, anytime - I'm borderline narcoleptic), so I hadn't really used it. The funny thing is, medical students really don't know much about anything that isn't on tests and until then I didn't know that taking Ambien and then not going to sleep can make you pretty high. In my case, being a lightweight in general, it made me absolutely loopy.

I ended up calling a buddy who was in pharmacy school who assured me everything would be fine and that it would wear off quickly, so I spent a couple of hours watching futurama on netflix (I love the show sober, but on Ambien, I was literally crying with laughter). It ended up costing me a few hours of studying, but I didn't internet gamble or spend all of my loan money on eBay buying nesting russian dolls so I guess it worked out in the end. When I got home, I made sure to remove the ambien pill bottle form my drug holding stuffed animal to avoid future mixups.

TLDR: I took the wrong little red pill when I woke up, ended up High AF for about 3 hours."	tifu	tifu	-1

Also, the Israel area wasn't even a sure thing.  Other places were considered before that, like Africa.

There are approximately 310 million legally obtained guns in the US, but according to [one study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime/), 80% of all gun crimes are committed by illegally obtained guns. Other sources put the number closer to 93%. That means that the true number of guns in this country is probably at least 500 million, if not *much* higher. 33,000 accidental shootings per year sounds like a lot, but that's only .0066% of all American guns being used in an accidental shooting. Even combined with the approximately 13,000 deliberate gun homicides committed each year, that's still only .0092%. And those numbers have been declining for decades while the number of guns has risen. 

Both sides are guilty of misinformation, but people really should do their research before demanding that our Constitution be changed to suit their beliefs."	"I own two guns.

If these boosters were in a normally printed standard set you would see me buying a case. Instead I won't spend a dime on boosters.

Wotc needs to change their printing policy sooner than later and print chase cards at rare and use the mythic slot simply for cards with flavor. Akroma at Mythic is totally fine by me. 

However, that means that the EV of a box should be better seeded at rare and that some rares should be downshifted to uncommon if their value and playability suggests that it is necessary to do so.

With the current state of ~~lottery tickets~~ booster packs, I don't even see myself wanting to spend the money to draft them. EA doesn't get away with the bullshit they pull in digital games, WotC shouldn't get away with it here. 

Wizards doesn't pay attention to the secondary market? I want proof. I want to see a 4 of 100 dollar card printed at rare. Goyf, Lili, Snapcaster all rare in one set. Then I could see a 10 dollar pricetag but then they would STILL be acknowledging the secondary market.

"I am part of an international team that studies *Archaeopteryx* with microtomography using synchrotron light. *Archaeopteryx* is a feathered dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Bavaria in Germany. We just [found out]( https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03296-8) that the cross cuts of its wing bones look remarkably like those of modern birds and interpreted this as evidence for active flight. However, we also recalled that the skeleton of *Archaeopteryx* was not equipped with the advanced flight adaptations that all present-day flying birds share. Furthermore, the recent years have uncovered evidence for various previously unrecognised aerial strategies that were adopted by early bird-like dinosaurs. This led us to the conclusion that *Archaeopteryx*, which remains among the oldest of them, must have represented one of many such evolutionary experiments of dinosaurian flight that ultimately went extinct, leaving only the flight of living birds today. Tomography in general - and synchrotron microtomography in particular - continues to unlock new possibilities for non-destructive and three-dimensional visualisation of important fossils. This promises much for the future of studying the past!

616	"If I may offer a geopolitical comment:

The Australian government is one of the largest (possibly still the largest) individual purchaser of US pharmaceuticals.  Australia buys in bulk for its 24m population.

The US pharmaceutical industry has lobbied hard and for a long time to change the way Australia negotiates its prices, and while it gets close it usually fails.  Australia only buys drugs it needs, and it negotiates prices on a whole-sale level.  Prices are not cheap, and some medicine still costs the government north of $100k per pill.  If this system is changed and prices are forced upwards this will have a drastic impact on Australia's budget and Australian domestic politics.  

It will have two consequences: practically, Australia will begin exploring buying from other industries including the rapidly growing Chinese pharma industry; and politically Australians will be alienated from America.

Also, a funny side note: inroads were made in the TPP to change Australia's rules, but then Trump pulled out and the proposed changes were abandoned."

Pretty simple, it has strong support within Labour and the Tories because it essentially guarantees that it's one of them that is in government.

If we had a system like STV for voting then that would guarantee the end of the stranglehold that both parties have over politics in the UK.

With FPTP people feel forced in most seats to vote for either Tories or Labour in England, because essentially all other votes are wasted and end up making it worse if anything for the side they'd prefer to win (lending a vote to the Greens for example would harm Labour by losing them a vote and possibly allow Tories to have the largest vote share even though the Green voter would most likely much prefer a Labour win over a Tory win).

When you can vote for the party that you prefer then it often looks different, looking at Scotland is a perfect example where the SNP were given an opportunity through the Scottish Parliamentary elections and proved themselves in government enough to completely supplant Labour at every level of politics, Scottish Greens also get a decent amount of support in Scottish Parliamentary elections which doesn't translate over to UK Parliamentary elections due to FPTP."

I chose the color, but allowed the girls to choose their own dresses for the day in the hope that they could wear them again.

Alice? Arisu? I'm just gonna call her Alice since that's what's actually written within the anime when her name appears on messages.

When Lain returns home, she doesn't find anyone there. Her home is lifeless. We've already seen from the first 2 episodes that her life at home feels abnormal with how distant everyone is. Something I noticed just now is that [her parents sleep in separate beds in a nearly empty room](https://i.imgur.com/MtBiRtk.png). Some of you noticed in the last episode that there seemed to be little passion in the kiss that the two had. It really gives the impression that [big spoilers](/s ""this is just a fake family."")

Lain once again displays some unusual behavior. First it's how she keeps repeating Alice's name slowly. Lain doesn't really know how to react to her classmate who is expressing worry for her. There's just something about some of her lines that feels artificial. The next strange thing about her behavior is a lot more obvious. Her personality keeps changing from shy and nervous to more confident and direct. There's apparently this ""wild"" Lain that is on the Wired enough for people to recognize her. When she went back to the club, the guy there knew her, implying she frequently went there before. When she's questioning the kids about the Psyche she obtained and Taro asked for a date, her face quickly turned hostile, far different from the reserved girl she normally is. To make things more strange, the episode ends with Lain working on upgrading her Navi. She barely had any knowledge on technology and had little interest in the Wired. Now she's directing all her attention towards it.

This was a slower episode with not a lot drama or bizarre hallucinations. But it's still necessary to help build up Lain's character and foreshadow some important plot points. There's also a certain line that seems meaningless at first but is actually funny when you look back on it. I'll link it when the right episode comes (unless another rewatcher also caught that and links it in this discussion)."	anime	anime	-1

"Try switching your aside questions around from the other point of view.

1. Is it okay for a girl to say no to sex with her boyfriend if she is not feeling it? Of course!
2. Is it okay for a girl not to cum during sex even though they find their boyfriend attractive?  It happen all the time! In fact it is usually considered 'good form' for the guy to make some special effort to help the girlfriend to cum if she is able.

It sounds like your girlfriend (and you) have some expectations about what is supposed to happen during sex, i.e. that they fuck and the guy cums, and in that moment it is the proof of all those things that validate each other, i.e. you love her, find her attractive, etc.  ""Movie sex"", basically.

There are so many reasons why it doesn't happen that way.  One thing that's common is when people get stuck in their own heads and that prevents them from cumming.  They are anxious and thinking about something else: I've got a hair in my mouth, my belly looks gross, I have a headache, did I send that email to the wrong person... stuff like that going on in your head is stopping thousands of men and women from cumming right this second, all over the world.

It can be a real headfuck though.  *Why didn't he cum, doesn't he find me attractive? Why didn't I cum, is there something wrong with me?*  There is so much pressure to perform, and then if it doesn't happen the chasm seems like it opens up below.

I have had to tap-out myself from having sex because I couldn't cum, for whatever reason.  I have also refused sex from my drunk girlfriend returning in the middle of the night - again, play that situation with the genders reversed and see how it tastes.  I think in that situation there is a lot of pressure to perform, and then to say ""You have to cum"" really piles it on.  Even someone without your history could find it hard to cum in those circumstances.  I would find it difficult, even if on another day I could be up for it.

Her being drunk probably turned this situation into an emotional firebomb, which is unfortunate.  It isn't fair on you to take all of that on board.  I know it's only alcohol but another way of looking at it is, she was high on drugs and then had a freak-out.  I would hope that she would apologise to you for putting you in that situation once she is sober, but perhaps  she needs to hear again how things are difficult for you before she can realise it isn't anything to do with her body-image etc."	sex	sex	-1

Firstly, no one should engage in anything sexual they do not enjoy or enter into willingly even if their objections are baseless. The fact that your initial experience was coerced is probably the main reason you don't like it now. Secondly, your current bf could be being considerate in which case good for him but he could also be telling the truth. If you visit sites like this or the porn on the web it is easy to think that all men love haing their partners give them head. That is not the case. I can only talk from a personal perspective but I never found oral sex that big a deal. I never felt greatly stimulated and found it difficult to orgasm which took a long time and was often not very intense. However, I love pleasuring my partner and find the taste, smell and feel of cunt incredibly arousing so I could happily do it for as long as she wanted. You ought, perhaps, to discuss it calmly and openly with your bf to make sure you both understand each others true feelings. As for the taste of semen (sperm are the little tadpoles that swim about it it) it should be ok, rather musty but not unpleasant. It can vary with diet and between guys but generally should be fairly neutral.

Love your work so much. "	"No it's not.  I don't want to make that comparasion because Chinese Wuxia as an analog to Western Fantasy doesn't really fit right.  Beyond that, Tolkien's work relies extensively on his ability in world building.  Jin Yong's stuff relies heavily on his ability to appropriate different historical eras of China.  Jin doesn't have to come up with a new dialect of a new species of a human-like race, because Jin Yong's world doesn't deal with inter-cultural exchanges between races of bipeds.  He seldomly even dealt with inter cultural exchanges between Han and non Han Chinese, because those circumstances were rare in the historical eras he borrowed from.

&amp;#x200B;

The scope of comparing a writer of one culture to another, just because they both belong in this category of 'fantasy', from two cultural settings on different sides of the British Empire, written in two different languages aimed at different audiences, is lazy.  I don't need a western analog to introduce one of Hong Kong's greatest newspaper men whom was even more successful as a fiction writer.  But if one had to do it, I wouldn't have picked Tolkien as a counterpart to Jin Yong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, comparing Jin's work to Shakespeare is not like comparing him to Spielberg at all.  Shakespeare is perfectly fine as plain reading material.   Spielberg's is definitely not.  I can enjoy Cha's work on film, a television show, a stage produced musical, a comic book drawn by authors from Hong Kong (or Japan for that matter) or as a novel in its original form.  His stories defy medium.  I don't think anyone is confused by that.

"&gt;Then you'll have no trouble linking me to a scientific article on magic happening in a lab?

Your comment here opens a more important thread. 

My thesis is that miracles are more like consciousness, the external world, or morality: the evidence for them comes from observation, introspection, conversation, rather than from a lab. 

To ask for ""evidence of consciousness in a lab"" is a category error. All the behavior that consciousness is invoked to explain (speech, movement, response to stimulus) can be studied in a lab, but the hypothesis ""this being is conscious"" is a philosophical claim that must be tested within its own domain. 

Someone who denies the existence of the external world cannot be convinced with data from the lab. Heck, they can't even be convinced by hitting them with a piece of the material world. It's a philosophical claim that needs philosophical treatment. 

Someone who denies the existence of morality certainly cannot be pointed to evidence (videos!) from the lab. It requires some thinking. 

Similarly, the domain within which miracle claims must be evaluated is a philosophical and epistemological domain.  (a) what is a miracle? (b) can they possibly occur (logical possibility)? (c) if so, is there any good reason to think the world is the kind of place where the might be likely to occur? (d) if so, are there any events for which the best explanation is that it was a miracle? (forget ""only explanation"" -- all we need is ""best explanation"", the same as with consciousness. We *might* be unconscious meat machines, but it's not the best explanation.) (e) If so, then it is reasonable to conclude, on balance, that a miracle has occurred. 

And anyone who cares to can do the work of thinking through (a)-(e). 90% of the world already is aware of this stuff; the 10% who aren't can convince themselves of the truth, though it may take a year or two. "	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

728	"I don't think standard is a viable product that continues to grow with modern overshadowing it.

I don't want my cards becoming useless when a set rotates.....and that's the biggest factor and barrier for me to play standard. I don't want to throw money away. Modern is more powerful and is more fun because there is more options of decks to play. It solves all the problems of standard. 

Eternal formats simply don't have that problem. I worry that one day they will try to put modern on the back burner and try to make a ""new modern"".

If that happens i think there will be a massive outcry from the community and maybe a lot of ppl will want to leave the game. Or the new format will fail if ppl refuse to play a ""bad modern"". 

wotc is clearly wanting to influence the price of modern cards. Upshifting cards is clear evidence of this. A lot of ppl don't care about drafting a masters set for the draft experience, they are playing the lottery.

731	"I've addressed this in another post in this thread just now, but the gist is that since the organized left is practically non-existent in the United States, the ruling classes can afford the luxury of enacting their agenda through traditional means while letting Trump indulge in his rhetoric and his rallies. So long as the opposition lacks coherence and the will to take real action rather than impotently stage one or two large-scale marches a year, the ruling class is under no pressure to suppress them violently anytime soon. Of course, the extreme base they've delivered into Trump's hands has other ideas and delusions and frequently acts out without their control - hence the string of terrorist attacks in the past week and general escalation in right-wing violence since Trump was elected.

And further, fascism is not simply ""big government"" that suppresses dissent by force. If that was the case, it would be indistinguishable from other traditional authoritarian regimes. Fascism is much more complex and nuanced that a simple military junta. Now that I'm home and have access to my books and my desktop again, I'll simply take the concluding definition from Paxton's *Anatomy of Fascism* here:

&gt; Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.

I'll also include his list of ""mobilizing passions"" to give you a better idea of what fascist ideology is concerned with:

&gt; * A sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions
&gt; * The primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior to every right, whether individual or universal, and the subordination of the individual to it
&gt; * The belief that one's group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies, both internal and external
&gt; * Dread of the group's decline under the corrosive effects of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences
&gt; * The need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary
&gt; * The need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group's historical destiny
&gt; * The superiority of the leader's instincts over abstract and universal reason
&gt; * The beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group's success
&gt; * The right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint from any kind of human or divine law, right being decided by the sole criterion of the group's prowess within Darwinian struggle

Umberto Eco's *Ur-Fascism* essay is also an invaluable tool in learning about fascist ideology."	This is why I liked google plus. Circles man. Just put people in circles and it‚Äôs all easy.  Not a single person I knew in real life used it. 	worldnews	worldnews	-1

753	"12 team, standard scoring, auction league.

$200 salary.

We can potentially keep up to three players. I'll explain:

1)Franchise - You keep this player for an average dollar amount determined by the prices of the top 6 players at that position the year before. If you spent higher than the average, you are stuck with that price. Example: Franchise tag price for RBs is $50 this season, but if you bought Bell for $62 last year, you pay $62 again. You can keep them for as many seasons as you'd like as long as you don't drop them during the season (injured, drop, pick back up for cheap at the end of the year) and you're willing to pay the price.

This year, QB franchise is $15, RB franchise is $50, WR franchise is $44 and TE franchise is $17 

2) Golden Ticket - You can keep this player for the price you paid for them in the previous season, but you CAN NOT keep them next year with a franchise or transition tag. They must be re-enter the auction pool next season.  

3) Transition - Basically a RFA. Bidding starts among other owners at the price you paid last year and when the bidding ends you have the option to match the bid and retain the player or let them go to this highest bidder.

I really only have two players worth keeping, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Last season I paid $22 bucks for Kareem Hunt and $17 for Keenan Allen. So, do I franchise Hunt for $50 and Golden Ticket Allen for $17 to get an RB1/WR1 combo for $67? Do I ticket Hunt for $22 and transition Allen? Do I ticket Allen and let Hunt go for fears of a sophomore slump?

769	"So I don't know about diamond semiconductors, but I can explain the silicone realm.

Wafers are cylindrical. dies, (the individual units that are turned into ICs) must be rectangular due to properties related to how the wafer is cut apart. The curved bit on the outside ends up getting wasted. The larger the wafer, the greater the efficiency of space gets utilized, and not wasted. There a whole computationally Hard problem of determining how to orient dies of various sizes as appropriate to be the most efficient.

Silicone wafers are currently most commonly 300mm. There was a push to go up to 450mm, but it's uncertain if that will happen because the ingots get a bit unwieldy at that size. I believe the first wafers were 25mm, and since at the time the photolithography was making much larger dies, they couldn't get more than a couple fairly simple ICs out of each wafer. 

So I guess that it's not until 4'' (100mm) that the numbers would start to crunch. "	"Ok so I think I got it figured out.  I've got two meters.  One's labeled ""PV Meter"" and the other is ""PV Billing Meter"".  So my ""PV Meter"" is showing how many kWh my panels are making.  The ""PV Billing Meter"" is showing two numbers.  There's a 2 digit number labeled ""Va"" and then a 5 digit number labeled kWh.  You'd think the Va would be how many watts the house is pulling at that given moment, but nope apparently it's showing what's referred to on my bill as ""registers"".

So when it's showing ""09"" Va, according to my bill that's ""CPS Energy Delivered"" (CPS is the electric service btw), and ""10"" is ""PV Surplus"".

The electric company just installed some ""smart meters"" this past week.  My previous issue was my ""PV Meter"" was showing less than what my inverter program was saying was generated.  Now it's matching up 1 to 1.

So all that being said, engineer to engineer let me ask you a question.  I've got a nice, large tree on the south side of my house that keeps some of the panels from getting direct sunlight.  I can see it on my inverter monitor where several panels will be outputting nearly 200watts, some will be doing maybe 100, and others are way down in the 50watt area.  Does it even make sense to trim back the tree to get direct sunlight on all my panels?  My thinking is that while it would be great to have all panels generating the max energy they could generate, I'd end up just using the A/C more, which to me just means the net effect would be more energy consumption from the utility company.

Conspired with foreign powers is a big assumption to make. CKS did not want foreign powers to meddle in China's internal affairs. While he sought foreign funding and supplies, he made it clear that other nations were not to station their armies inside China proper.

Mao's uprising worked because he convinced the peasants to overthrow the landowners, and promised redistribution of the now vacant land among the peasants. Not only that, but he managed to get entire peasant families to join the CPC. Here's how:

Once the Communists distributed the land amongst the peasants, they would get the peasant's children to join their insurgency. Entire villages would send their sons and daughters (voluntarily or through coercion), and all of a sudden the CPC had a fighting force several times greater than the local NRA garrison. While the children fought, the parents provided the produce to feed them."	Denim, especially raw denim, can continue to bleed. Idk if your pair is raw denim though.

Anti-realism: the position that there is no real objective truth about formal or mathematical truths apart from the human mind.  We created the mathematical system, and mathematical statements are true in it or not because we can prove them or not.  There is no such thing as the number 1 or addition or integrals that exist apart from the human mind.

Realism: The position that real objective truths about formal systems and mathematics do exist apart from the human mind.  1 does exist whether there are people to think about it or not, so does addition, and integration.  mathematical statements are true or false on the basis of whether they correspond to the real objective mathematical ""realm"" if you will.

Craigs short little argument that the OP is talking about says that under realism or anti-realism, the naturalist (ie. believer that there is no supernatural, only natural) has no good explanation for why their is coherence between mathematical truths and nature (whether mathematical truths are realist or anti-realist)

&gt;Depends on what you mean by structure. [A mathematical structure is a set of abstract entities with relations between them. The natural numbers under arithmetic constitute a structure, with relations such as ""is evenly divisible by"" and ""is greater than"". Here the relation ""is greater than"" includes the element (3, 4), but not the element (4, 3).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(philosophy_of_science)#Definition_of_structure)  
&gt;  
&gt;Under that definition, no. Not really. Even a ""chaos"" would still have structural relations.

Your example of greater then and evenly divisible by would still be true whether or not they were usefully applicable to the world.  Craig's challenge is for a naturalistic explanation for why those concepts should be useful for explaining the physical reality.

&gt;This kind of minimal structure cannot support self-aware intelligences, so this is solved by the anthropic principle.

So first off, Craig's not going to accept the anthropic principle and has responded to it in way more depth then he went into in this article about mathematics.

Second off, why?  What's your argument that the minimal structure cannot support self aware intelligence's? Craig believes that minds can exist independently of matter of all together.  You seem to be pre-supposing naturalism when you reject the possibility of immaterial minds, which is what Craig is arguing against.  Even if minds cannot exist without material brains, why couldn't they exist in a universe where only a minimal mathematical structure is applicable?"	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1
785	"PC is fun, challange, gameplay.
Console is for peasants that want to press 1 button and see how their character plays himself."	"Storymode:

- A story that you can actually lose. Not just by dying or something, rather a story that you can actually fail to accomplish your ultimate goal. 

- Ability to choose to side with angels/demons/humanity (Zoltun Kulle was right, change my mind)

- Not starting out as a hero/god/demigod/chosen one/etc. Just being a normal person who wants to do what they believe is good/evil. 

Mechanics/gameplay:

- A focus more on the character's strengths rather than the gear's strength (more like D1, less like D3) Not saying loot can't be unique/powerful, but the reliance on sets/specific build-enabling items/excessive power creep leaves the game pretty stale and lacking in complexity/uniqueness IMO. 

- Learning/obtaining skills should be rewarding and unique; leveling up/buying a skill/getting a skill drop shouldn't just be ""Now you have the ability to do X!"".

 There has to be a better way that makes more sense. Like defeating an angel/demon and carrying its carcass/weapons/organs to someone who can extract its power for you to harness, maybe there's some negative effects that go along with the power you gain. Maybe you can offset these effects with gear/further honing your skills with other mechanics/etc.

793	"This is actually extremely simple. God created everything, hence he is the absolute authority. He determines what is right and what is wrong. He gives you the freedom to choose, but he does not exempt you from the consequences of your choises. So he says what's good and what's bad.

So in a way you are right, seeing God as an individual, a person, which is how the Bible describes him, them there is no absolutely objective moral, we follow then God's subjective moral, which is fine in my book "	"You might be interested in studying Leibinz's theory of perception, or Ruyer's theories of consciousness.

I think there are at least three kinds of consciousness: there is the sort of consciousness that all living things have, like how cells signal or how plants know when to bloom in spring. This is the sort of consciousness that Ruyer likens to a worker focused on his work. We might say it is the consciousness of consumption, since it involves objects actually entering into the living subject. This subject's consciousness is focused entirely within the subject itself.

Then there is the sort of consciousness most evident to us: the one associated with the nervous system and the five senses. This consciousness is different from the first sort, since it doesn't involve consuming the object, nevertheless, the object is within the subject's consciousness. Furthermore, the object is known through the object's behavior within a sensory field (the eye knows an object in so far as it reflects a certain slither of light). The object is also know in relation to the subject (will it eat me? Can I eat it?).

I think the latter sort of consciousness is qualitatively distinct from the former, rather than a mere advancement of the former, because we experience each kind as distinct. We don't feel our cell's activities unless there are nerves involved. Even damage to our body is undetected if we don't see it and our nerves aren't there.

Anyway, finally we have reflective or recursive consciousness, where *consciousness itself* is an object of consciousness. This allows the subject to compare the mental with the object, detecting whether the image of the mind is true to the object. Reflective consciousness allows the subject to discern past the appearances of an object given to the senses to know the object in itself, which is the root of all of what we call science. This kind of consciousness then, as a result, doesn't necessarily have to relate the object to the subject, and so we might say the object can be loved for its own sake, which is the root of what we call art. Such a subject can even reflect on its actions and relate them to a standard, knowing if they are right or wrong. As far as we are aware, only human beings show any real evidence of this kind of consciousness."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

796	"This interchange is starting to smell a bit of Canon-White-Knighting. But in case you really don't know, here is a list of existing APS-C lenses that have larger aperture than any Canon APS-C lens of similar focal length: Sigma 30mm f1.4 EX DC HSM, Sigma 30mm f/1.4 DC HSM Art, Sigma 30mm f1.4 DC DN, Sigma 16mm f1.4, Samyang 12mm f2, Samyang 16mm f2, Tokina 11-16mm f2.8, Tokina 11-16mm f2.8 II, Tokina 11-20mm f2.8, Tokina 14-20mm f2, Tokina 12-28mm f4, Sigma 10-20mm f3.5, Sigma 50-100mm f1.8, Sigma 18-35mm, Samyang 10mm f2.8, Mitakon Speedmaster 35mm f0.95, Mitakon Speedmaster 25mm f0.95, Nikon 35mm f1.8.

There are probably others, these are just the ones I either remembered or found with a quick search. Point is there are plenty of people that don't need the increased solution of the larger and more expensive sensors, and just want larger aperture and higher quality focusing motors. But Canon purposefully makes these things exclusive to their full frame line of lenses to force people to buy the more expensive solution. The fact that Nikon and Sony do the same thing doesn't make it less annoying."	I think M5 and M50 was their experiment camera for FF mirrorless. It has EVF, eyeAF, video stabilization, DPAF, adapter etc. They have been working on the lens development and other tech until it's mature as battery and better EVF.

Does the ex value both of your happiness enough that if you being together is what makes you happy he can accept it (doesn't sound likely)? 

None of it is really right or wrong IMO, but just how people feel and what they see as the best option here.

For me, I would have a lot of inner turmoil if I was the friend. I'd feel guilty, but also know that I acted on feelings I've had for a long time. And it wasn't cheating or anything. But that's your buddys ex girl. There's a certain sort of ""off limits"" pressure that you can't really escape feeling. 

Honestly, I think you guys should be able to be friends at least. If that causes the ex to go apeshit, then so be it. Dude sounds like he's got some growing up to do, anyway."	AmItheAsshole	AmItheAsshole	-1

843	"""To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize""

In a society where talking about problems men face is off limits, and all discussions about problems must be in regards to women, LGBT+, or (certain groups of) visible minorities, I think it is difficult to make the claim that these groups do not have significant influence at the centre of power. 

With that said, it doesn't matter whether a group has institutional power or not, when they see themselves as victims they can do horrific things to other (typically innocent) people. A group of Islamic men who are upset that believe they're victims of a racist society may justify raping and/or pimping white girls; but the fact that they weren't in a position of power is no consolidation to the women who they raped or pimped out. Almost all of the horrible things you hear that one person (or group of people) did to another person (or group of people) is ""justified"" by them taking the mantle of the victim.

The victim mentality is a cancer in society and people need to purge it from their minds. Most people have horrible things that happen to them in their lives and few people ever have much institutional power, this does not make you a victim of a greater problem and you're not justified in taking it out on people who had nothing to do with your circumstances."

853	I‚Äôll start. Yesterday I was driving back home from work, and I was going down a single lane stretch of road. The speed limit is 35, but since there are wide lanes and usually no cops, I was going 40. After a while, I notice a lifted red Dodge Ram barreling towards me in my rear view mirror. He was going at least 60 mph. I decide to humor him and go 50, which is 15 over what I should be doing. Of course, mr dodge doesn‚Äôt think this is fast enough so he starts riding my ass. With probably a foot of distance between us, he keeps speeding up, leaning to the left as if to try and pass me, and generally being an ass. This goes on for about 3 miles and at that point I was considering pulling into a gas station or something to let this guy by. But then, I notice that I‚Äôm approaching the area where the road becomes two lanes, just before a 3 way stop light. I know this intersection because there is always a cop  hiding behind a car wash just after the intersection. As I approach the red light, I slow down to 35, utterly pissing off my tailgater. As soon as he reaches the two lane split, he guns it past me and slams his brakes placing him next to me at the stop light. Now, at this point I am sure that this asshole has no idea that there‚Äôs a cop up ahead and that he‚Äôs only concentrated on gunning it as soon as the light turns green. So here‚Äôs my revenge moment. I wait until the opposing cars are finished making their left turn, with our red light still on, I lurch forward about 5 feet. Mr dodge takes the bait, and sees my movement as a sign that the light has turned green when it hasn‚Äôt. He floors it, tires screeching, smoke billowing, right through the red light. About 500 feet later, the hidden Ford Explorer cruiser turns on their lights and pulls him right over. I drive the rest of the way home with a grin on my face.	Ah, thank you!!

"As far as I can tell, he's just saying that when GTA V was released, the PS3 and Xbox 360 were both at their peak in terms of units sold, both being at about 80m. This meant a huge customer base of about 160m.

This is not the case for this console generation where, while the PS4 is at about 80m sold, the Xbox One is only at about 40m according to predictions, meaning, assuming one person to a console, about 40m fewer customers if GTA 6 came out now.

While you can criticise the fact that he's not taking into account that GTA 6 is probably coming out quite a few years from now, and that both consoles are still selling very well, your claims are also just wrong.

&gt;Even if that were true or even measurable in any truly accurate way it doesn't change anything.

&gt;And if you think it makes a difference now then it could be said with your comment that PS3 was lagging when GTA V was released.

I mean, it is true, it is measurable and the size of the customer base does change quite a lot. Also, the PS3 was not lagging behind at that point, both consoles reported 80m sales very close to GTA V's release date.

&gt;Maybe by the end of their lifespan they were close but we're talking about the $1 billion sales in 3 days for GTA V here and that was released 3 years before the end of the lifespan of both consoles.

&gt;The PS3 through much of its lifespan was lagging behind and only started significantly closing the gap in the last few years of the lifespan.

As I've said, they were both at 80m very close to when the game was released. Not sure what you mean when you say GTA V was released 3 years before the end of their life. It was released in September 2013 and both the PS4 and Xbox Once were released in November 2013 meaning GTA V was released 2 months before the end of the seventh generation.

If you look at Marbury v. Madison (technically the case which in theory gave the judciary the ability to perform judicial review), all that it really said is that the judiciary could refuse to act due to a law being unconstitutional.  It was through inaction, not action, that resulted in what the judiciary could perform.

That somehow several judges have taken Marbury v. Madison and turned it into active responses and presumed the judicial review when it never was there in the first place is where the problem comes.  One federal judge even went so far as to impose a tax (which was later overturned.... but that it happened at all should be concerning).

When the judiciary refuses to acknowledge a law as constitutional and refuses to let prosecutions or any government enforcement happen to unconstitutional provisions, they are doing their job.

Hinata has the byagukan and can easily pinpoint where Konan is if she does her paper tricks. Sakura has Katsuyu that counters Konan + negates most damage team 1 would even take. TenTen could spam her kunai to put Konan into good positioning for their team. 

All Ino has to do is transfer Hinata's thoughts of where Konan is to Sakura/Katsuyu and they could possibly take her down pretty easily.

Temari could be a threat, but Sakura probably has the speed/durability to close the distance and take her out. If she'd rather not risk it, she could probably transfer Chakra to Hinata for her to create a huge Air Palm and knock her out.

You should ask your doctor/dentist for a prescription for ""debacterol"". It is an acid swab that will destroy canker sores. It works really well if you get bad ones. (does **not** work on herpes)

Also, a bit weird that he tested it. A canker sore is on the soft tissue in your mouth. (Herpes is not) I am not a doctor, but even the worst canker sore(imagine a huge cluster of sores on the inside of your cheek) could never be the result of herpes. Herpes might cause a really bad blister on your lip which spread to your whole face, but it wouldn't move into your mouth(as far as I know)

A lot of doctors get mixed up, but the two are obviously different and the only similarity is that they cause oral sores.

I don't really have an agenda, but as a sufferer of canker sores, I wound up learning a lot about herpes/canker. I kept having doctors insist that canker sore=herpes. This apparently isn't abnormal. There was apparently a case where a picture of a canker sore was used in medical literature as an example of herpes.

Some could say it's setting up the Injustice story line or the Flashpoint story line, which would be a really ham fisted attempt at trying to copy Marvel's dovetailing. But I honestly think it was just made to look cool for the trailer. It didn't further the plot of the film at all and felt really out of place. The actual fight itself was too short and too lame. Batman literally throws a kitchen sink at Superman. Their mothers having the same name was the reason they became best buddies instantly. WTF? They absolutely and pointlessly WASTED (as well as botched) Doomdsay by shoehorning him into the film because they needed something for the partially formed Justice League to fight at the end when it should have been about Batman fighting Superman. Wonder Woman was shoehorned in before she was introduced with her own film. The Flash and Aquaman cameos were stupid and pointless. Why did Lex have their logos on those files? Did he make the logos? What? They wasted the death of Superman because now we'll never see it the way it should be, huge processions through the streets with superheroes like Green Lantern attending. It should have been a moving plot point but it was just kinda 'Meh, he's dead' with a quiet little funeral with Batman and Wonder Woman off in the shadows.

"If you are employed and aren't on some form of welfare you are most likely paying close to 60% in taxes in the US.  When you get your pay check and you see the giant amount withheld for taxes that is the second time that has happened with your paycheck.  The goverment taxes your employer based on your worth, your employer passes that cost on to you by lowering your paycheck accordingly. So once your paycheck has been taxed twice it is taxed a third time when you actually spend it.  Somewhere around 10% sales tax.

And then of course there are all the excise taxes.  Do you have gas piped to your home?  Excise tax.

"	"I'm going to graduate in about a week so here's my two cents:

You're paying to go to college, so why not just go to class? I understand that it's your money and you do want you want with it, but what is that money worth if you're not using it for what you paid for? Whether you're taking out loans or paying upfront, you're still paying money go to to school. Go to class, seriously. If not for the education, at least do it for the routine. Not every professional job is going to allow flexibility for your schedule. Of course, if you have a dire reason that you absolutely cannot go to class, sure, you can skip class, but at least notify your professor that you won't be in class and consult the syllabus for what you're going to miss on that date.

Internships are fantastic opportunities that introduce you to your field. Paid or unpaid, it's well-worth the experience and can provide some insight on your future career. My major requires an internship to graduate, but it's still a learning experience even if yours doesn't require one.

Your professors want you and every student to pass. If you're struggling, reach out to them. I made out with a GPA of around 3.00 because I rarely spoke with most of my professors, and I believe I could've done better, but it's already too late for me. Your professor would be delighted to help you out with your grade. Of course, not every professor is like this, so take this advice with a grain of salt. 

Your college experience is how you make it. Join fraternities, sororities, clubs, organizations, etc. You can work on campus to make money and friends, depending on the job. You can also help a professor with their research. Like the definition of success, you define your experience as how you want it to be."	AdviceAnimals	AdviceAnimals	-1

Someone with an art history degree may end up working at Starbucks short term or even long term, but someone with no college degree at all is never going to offered something better.  It's absolutely true that government money is causing a rise in prices, but if you subscribe to the idea college education represents a positive externality and that even the private returns to a college education still far exceed the private costs (on average and over one's lifetime), neither of which I think are very controversial notions, you could make the argument that even the astronomical tuition costs we are seeing these are *still* below that of a long run equilibrium.  	Where did that come from? When did we ever start talking about children? People should be responsible but defending corporations' rights to low taxes by attacking people choosing to have multiple kids is probably the worst strawman argument I've ever seen.

Nor do I think you're an asshole for bringing this to the teacher to ask that they be removed from your group. Or the principal for his terrible response. 

That said, how far off is this performance? Because, surely, you've had some inkling before now that they are not prepared? That they haven't been practicing or keeping pace with the progress of the other team members? If you've been keeping quiet and just letting them do their own thing without any encouragement or good faith attempts to get them to participate, and have been planning in the back of your mind for some time to kick them out days before the performance, that is bordering on asshole behavior.

It's not your job to babysit or force these students to do stuff. But frequently, the ""unspoken lesson"" in group projects is that it's a team building exercise, and a lesson in how to work with others (however unwilling they may be.) Open communication earlier in the term would have been key so that your teacher could guide you (or step in if warranted.) You should be prepared to answer some possibly tough questions about why you waited until now to make the teacher aware of their behavior, past the point of the teacher being able to do anything about it if they were so inclined. At the very least, there would have been some documentation that they were being little shits, and could have taken that into account when grading the group if they are more hands-off.

Maybe you really were trying to give these folks space in the hopes that they'd get it together and didn't realize until it was too late that that wouldn't happen. But you have to know going in that there is a real possibility that from the teacher's point of view, and to anyone else on the outside looking in, that it might appear that you just sat on your hands and purposely didn't do anything so that they could fall flat on their faces.

I think your theory of D&amp;D culture is probably possible - perhaps even just on a sub-conscious level. Remember, by the time Garfield designed Magic, he had already designed dozens of games, even if they weren't published. One thing his friends from the time say, is that he really just understood games on an instinctive level - so I imagine the 20 life came from a sub-conscious place, perhaps inspired by years of playing D&amp;D. I know that's not a concrete answer, but I hope it helps!""*

It's a country transitioning to socialism.

Regardless, socialism is when there is worker control over the means of production, as opposed to capital control over the means of production. Venezuela is 'socialist', because while it hasn't outright expropriated the entirety of the means of production, it has effectively neutered capital by introducing price controls, capital controls, threats of expropriations, and poor and arbitrary rule of law to make it so that capital no longer controls the means of production, whilst still technically owning it on paper. If you can't set the price for the goods you create, if you can't move your capital, and if you can't shut down your means of production due to threats that the government will expropriate it if you do (which is well documented in the Venezuelan case), there is no longer capital control over the means of production.

So yeah, maybe most of the means of production are, on paper, still owned by capital. But with the restrictions on them, they're no longer controlled by capital. They're held in trust by the vanguard party on behalf of the proletariat. It's not a society that has achieved full socialism, but it's definitely a socialist society."	australia	australia	-1

What if Sean Carroll fails to *redefine the 2nd law of thermodynamics*.  Would that make WLCs model automatically correct?  Not at all, they're different models.  What if Sean Carroll suceeds in redefining the 2nd law of thermodynamics.  Does that make WLCs model automatically wrong?  

What are the implications of somebody attempting to redefine the 2nd law of thermo dynamics, as you put it.  Does that make them a fool?  Does that make them fringe?

If we assume God exists as a premise of the argument, and only consider why God would create reality if he knows everything possible about it, the most reasonable conclusion is ""for his entertainment"".

I'd send my follow up email and usually end it off with something along the lines of: ""... would also be open to meeting up for coffee to discuss this if that's more convenient for you!"" 

What I like about this approach is that I think it's important to be respectful of people's time - and this method allows the mentor to choose what level of commitment they are comfortable with: they can just not reply your email, reply your questions, or go out for coffee with you!

I don‚Äôt think the Yiga clan were wasted potential. In fact if they had been taken seriously it would have felt pretty out of place in a Zelda title.

I don't think it's immoral to have your child circumcised either.  As you've pointed out, there are certain benefits and relevant medical guidance exists to support such a decision.  I just don't think it's the best possible decision.

&gt;Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought mostly Jews considered circumcision a religious practice. A christian family would have a doctor or nurse do it, while a Jewish family would have a rabbi do it.

It doesn't have to be a religious practice in order to be religiously motivated.  I think many Americans view America as the Israel of a second covenant or something like this."

It is also reasonable to say that the human heart has to worship something. It constantly is searching for that something. Whether it be another human, drugs, sports, woodworking, a new car, a job, etc. It will find something to worship. Since all of these things carry with them innate brokenness, it is reasonable to say that at some point throughout our worship of them, they will come up short. They will let us down. Leave us empty. Now If the loving, perfect God of the Bible existed, it would be completely within their character to demand worship. Not for its own benefit, but the benefit of its creation.

[New York Times, June 20, 2013](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/magazine/the-obama-campaigns-digital-masterminds-cash-in.html)

&gt; **Data You Can Believe In**

&gt; The Obama Campaign‚Äôs Digital Masterminds Cash In

&gt; To understand how it works, you must first understand the vast technological engine that powered the campaign but remained largely out of view of the public and the press. Messina, the campaign manager, often boasted about how the Obama 2012 effort would be ‚Äúthe most data-driven campaign ever.‚Äù But what that truly meant ‚Äî the extent to which the campaign used the newest tech tools to look into people‚Äôs lives and the sheer amount of personal data its vast servers were crunching ‚Äî remained largely shrouded. The secrecy around the operation was partly because the president‚Äôs strategists wanted to maintain their competitive edge. But it was also no doubt because they worried that practices like ‚Äúdata mining‚Äù and ‚Äúanalytics‚Äù could make voters uncomfortable. (...)

&gt; They started with a list that grew to a million people who had signed into the campaign Web site through Facebook. When people opted to do so, they were met with a prompt asking to grant the campaign permission to scan their Facebook friends lists, their photos and other personal information. In another prompt, the campaign asked for access to the users‚Äô Facebook news feeds, which 25 percent declined, St. Clair said.

&gt; Once permission was granted, the campaign had access to millions of names and faces they could match against their lists of persuadable voters, potential donors, unregistered voters and so on. ‚ÄúIt would take us 5 to 10 seconds to get a friends list and match it against the voter list,‚Äù St. Clair said. They found matches about 50 percent of the time, he said. But the campaign‚Äôs ultimate goal was to deputize the closest Obama-supporting friends of voters who were wavering in their affections for the president. ‚ÄúWe would grab the top 50 you were most active with and then crawl their wall‚Äù to figure out who were most likely to be their real-life friends, not just casual Facebook acquaintances. St. Clair, a former high-school marching-band member who now wears a leather Diesel jacket, explained: ‚ÄúWe asked to see photos but really we were looking for who were tagged in photos with you, which was a really great way to dredge up old college friends ‚Äî and ex-girlfriends,‚Äù he said."

1068	"&gt;NTR is about inferiority, humiliation and degradation. None of the scenes in harem anime where the MC chooses one girl are painted with any kind of NTR light. 

I mean you could make a case that harem anime does this to the girls.  Having them dress skimpy in fetishistic outfits  Especially maid outfits and call the guy ""master"".  Always being a slave to the guy(doing the chores).  Plus the guy always being in charge and more powerful than the girls.  Having the girls be damsels in distress.  Some shows like Sekirei basically dehumanize the girls into pokemon.

&gt;The focus is all on the guy feeling bad but being honest, the girls pain and (usually) bittersweet acceptance. Framing it as NTR would be the MC turning down his other love interests by kissing the heroine infront of them while talking about how much better she is than them.

He's still being taken away.  It's that most of these shows don't play him off as a jerk while doing it.  I remember in Omamori Himari where the main girl: Himari stated how she's much better than the other girls in the harem because he Kissed her instead of her kissing him.  Rubing it in the other girls' faces.  In many Harems the main girl is usually seen as the ""true"" girl with the rest of the girls(especially the childhood friend who could never compete with a magical girlfriend) being lower.  In harems the guy is still causing pain to the other girls by being dense so still responsible for their suffering.  Imagine dating two girls at the same time and they find out.  I'm not too sure saying ""Well I love both of you"" is going to work out.  

&gt;Do you also complain that there's an endless list of girl characters considered cute by physically assaulting the MC

1075	"&gt; They didn't suppress religion merely because they didn't believe that God existed.

&gt; It was an additional belief which motivated their behaviour: that religion was so evil and dangerous to the progress of society that it ought to be suppressed.

Right. **Atheism** in general is simply not believing in any god. No agenda can follow from the absence of belief.

The basis for suppression of religion might be **antitheism**. If you believe religion is harmful to society, which I do, it makes sense to further it's decline. It doesn't follow however to use violence and injustice for that cause. You need yet another belief or the lack of respect for the rights of other humans to support the spilling of blood over it. I wouldn't.

---

&gt; But I think the same is true for, say, the Spanish Inquisition:

&gt; It wasn't merely they believed God existed which motivated them.

&gt; It was the additional belief that heresy was so dangerous to people's immortal souls that consequently they ought to suppress religious dissent by force.

Right again, though this time, the belief is or can be **founded in scripture**. Scripture which not only the violent fundamentals propagate. The moderate Christians value and share the same book. They interpret it differently, but the calls for violence are in the text, not in the interpretation. Take, for example, 1 Samuel 15:3, where God calls for genocide and scorched earth: ""*Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.*""

Antitheism and atheism don't have such a written foundation, thus don't have inherent violence. I'd be something else if they had."	"OP, do you not realise there are plenty of secular determinists?

You're actually making the argument from Einstein's ""god does not play dice"" without realising that Einstein was an atheist using a metaphor.

I did as best I can. I‚Äôm not a canonist. So I mad a mistake earlier and can‚Äôt guarantee I‚Äôm getting the nuance right. That‚Äôs really what I mean. 

If someone wants to correct me please, I‚Äôd love to learn it better myself. 

&gt; We have established that couple that NEVER has sex (e.g. Mary and Joseph), and thus never become one flesh - CAN be married.

You keep making this point and it keeps being irrelevant. 

The relevant is that they *can*, not that they do. 

This is back to the drivers license issue. I *can* get a license. That doesn‚Äôt mean I must *drive*. A condition that made me unable to get a license isn‚Äôt inconsistent because other people get the license and don‚Äôt use it. 

&gt; But what if they don't?  

Then they don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs also irrelevant to the conditions to be able to be married. 

See above. You‚Äôre conflating the requirements to get married with requirements for being married. They‚Äôre two different sets of rules. 

&gt; Mary had a kid from Holy Spirit, not from Joseph.

Yes. Which kind of implies they‚Äôre open to having kids.

After trading for Cole, he and Savard became the shutdown pair, and they were decent at it. All 3 players were around 55% d zone starts, Ryan Murray rounded out that group around 52%.

With how anemic our forward group was last year, it felt like Jones and Werenski were always going out for O Zone faceoffs just because they were the only D pairing that was any good at creating offense, and the gap to the second best pairing was huge as far as offense goes. 

I think if Jones and Werenski didn't have such great chemistry, that Jones would end up with a more 50/50 split on the zone starts. I also think that if either Gostisbehere or Provorov were right handed and played well together, it would be a very very similar situation to Jones and Werenski. Provorov and Gostisbehere would probably have way better stats though just because of the firepower up front in Philly."	So he's the best swimmer.

Every couple weeks he would be subject to polygraph tests asking him if he had any interactions with minors if he said yes he risked violating the terms of his plea, if he was caught lying he risked the same. They would take some considerations of the normal interactions like ‚Äúyes, I saw minors at a store I was at, but avoided interacting with them‚Äù but Halloween was a particular difficult time for him to do anything.

1112	"In my opinion, studying comparative religion, if done with a genuine curiosity (really really really important), can enhance your own religious experience within your own religion. I'm not necessarily talking about adding on any additional beliefs into your own belief system, though. For example, I'm a Christian and after looking into some Buddhist teachings, I sort of fell in love with the meditation aspect, and through meditation, my own religious experience has been enhanced.  

&gt;  I find that if we observe and understand the parallels between all religion without non-religious cultural nuances, we may all understand the function and purpose of religion.  

I believe that the function and purpose of religion is unique to each religious sect, so one only would need to study their own religion to find out this.

&gt;does your personal ideology allow for philosophical compromises between other systems of belief

Again, if it's a philosophical teaching that goes along with something that my own religion teaches, it provides a different aspect. But as far as forming a compromise between that and my own beliefs, that's way more complex and situational.

&gt; how/where do you find these compromises?

Compromises, imo, typically only happen in areas where your own belief system is lacking.

Overall, studying other religions openly can really enhance your world view and I 11/10 recommend doing it. I've loved every minute of it and have had a lot of cool interactions and experiences."	Yes, because I think that if there was a higher power that was outside of our ways, we would have an eternal purpose, and would be in the care of something. Based on what I have seen, I don't put too much faith in humanity because I've seen how fallible and evil people can be, and how completely subjective they view themselves and the world around them. Believing in a higher power removes that subjectivity, and allows for an absolute (at least this is what I want to believe) that is outside of, and uncontained by, human understanding.

So even if you take away Conqueror, Yorick would have a **bigger** winrate, and that is to say that Conqueror isn't the reason why he has a big winrate.

And before you try to use the argument that there is a difference in pickrate: Globally Yorick has a bigger winrate **and** bigger pickrate on Grasp of the undying, so trying to spin this on a lower pickrate isn't gonna work.

1136	"That's why I said arguably. My arguments for these three games:

Witcher 3 does have separate paths. They are more subtle than most. Do you focus on weapons, alchemy or magic? Maybe a mix of all three. Do you spend the time to craft your gear, or use whatever you find? You also have a wide world of optional content and a story that splits depending on your choices, which is technically more than Oblivion did.

Prey is more iffy, but there are definite different play styles. You can remain human and focus on guns, solve issues with hacking, or maybe go for Typhon powers. Every choice you make with your tool and power set ripples out. Go heavy on Typhon powers and suddenly the station tech sees you as an enemy, adding another layers of issues to deal with.

Now lets say a player from Dallas who is making $8 million a year is traded to Toronto.  Does Toronto now have to make that players cap hit 10.5 million(or whatever the equivalent is) against their cap so the player can make the exact same amount of money?

Now all these highly taxed provinces/states would have something else to bitch about with taking on salaries that are higher than the player signed for.

"To expand a little on what /u/angelcake said, the testes are the primary producer of testosterone in AMAB people. Having them removed gets rid of the body's primary source of testosterone, therefore eliminating (usually) the need for an anti-androgen. Anti-androgens can be a bit hard on the liver over an extended period of time, so it's better if one can stop taking them at some point. Either an orchi or GRS (which also includes an orchi in the process) will take care of that.

Some trans women do not want, or cannot get, GRS, and orchi is a much less expensive (and far quicker and less invasive) option. It's often a stopgap, and a person can still have GRS in the future if they choose, but it at least eliminates certain worries. If for some reason a trans woman was unable to get hormones for a while, having had an orchi means they wouldn't have to worry about remasculinizing anymore (although it's important to note that *everyone* needs a primary sex hormone, whether estrogen or testosterone. Going for more than a year or two without a primary sex hormone of any type massively increases the risk of osteoporosis, among other nasty health issues.

It *is* jarring (not because she's a woman like everyone is trying to say, and the article only mentions for a short bit) but because it's the only game that does it in a whole slew of action adventure games. God of War, Assassin's Creed, Batman, Spiderman, Dark Souls, Zelda, Uncharted, and so on, none of them have even close to as violent and gruesome of deaths as Tomb Raider.

The only other games to have them are horror games (Dead Space for example).

So I would agree, it has always felt out of place and IMO does not add much to the game. It doesn't fit with the aesthetic the way it does in a horror game and it doesn't do it gleefully the way Mortal Kombat does. It just felt like something done for no reason.

EDIT: I see that some people are saying that Tomb Raider historically had gruesome deaths so it's just staying true to the franchise. I didn't remember that from the old games, but if that's true then it makes a lot more sense.

The whole woman thing IMO just seems like an unfortunate coincidence that now can be latched onto. It just so happens that this is the one of few action adventure style game with a female protagonist and it's also the only one with gruesome deaths. It's just bad luck."	Games	Games	-1

If you don't want to read it, the TLDR is that this poll is total statistical garbage and you can't draw any meaningful conclusions from it.  
  
&gt;I'd be happy if this was true, but this poll is completely invalid statistically. As far as I can tell, it's not random at all and you have to choose to seek it out and participate, which makes it no more useful than a Facebook poll. All it takes is a bunch of people from one side telling all their friends to go vote and you end up with an incredibly unrealistic result like a very conservative, very rural state apparently being 80% in favour of legalization. Like, seriously, you think over 70% of Republicans in North Dakota want pot legalized? Give me a break. This poll is a joke and the fact it's sitting at 95% upvoted says a lot about the willingness of people in this sub to read past a headline.

&gt;Edit: Jesus Christ people. I just read that there were only 237 people in North Dakota that participated in this poll. Even if it was a randomly-selected poll (which, again, it's not), 237 isn't even close to a large enough sample to get valid results. Anything below about 300 and you might as well be making up the responses due to the incredibly high margin of error. That's why you'll almost never see publicly released political polling with less than that number of respondents. I can't overstate this enough: don't base any of your opinions on this crap.

1168	"A couple of things to remember when printing photos or displaying them online. 

Make sure you are using at a minimum a 100% sRGB color gamut IPS screen. Many ips screens can do 100% but not all and the cheaper the less likely. You can get a 100% adobeRGB IPS screen, which is more expensive, but it may be overkill for the next reason. 

Make sure you are editing/exporting in the correct color gamut that you will be displaying (online) or printing to. Web browsers and Instagram will display photos in sRGB gamut. Most professional print services (I personally use mpix and adoramapix) have their printer set to sRGB gamut and request files uploaded for printing be set to sRGB jpgs or sRGB 8bit tiff. If you have your own printer that can print in adobRGB or ProRGB, then it makes sense to buy an adobeRGB screen to edit and print in adobeRGB. But again any web posting will need to be in sRGB. 

The importance of proper color gamut for web and printing can‚Äôt be stressed enough. Colors in computers are based on a set of coordinates of 0-256 and displayed as (0, 0, 0) - (256, 256, 256) depending if the color. sRGB has a smaller gamut than adobeRGB which means that a color coordinate in adobe might not represent the same color when covered to sRGB. This is a reason for color banding that may occur in some photos you have seen online where the computer is trying to display the correct color but it doesn‚Äôt look right. 

I suggest watching videos and reading more up on color gamut so you can be aware how to get the most out of your edits and subsequent digital or physical prints. 

By being aware of this you can prevent an expensive print coming back with a different tone, different colors, or too dark/bright from what you saw on the screen.

The one who created them (and us) with the gift of free will before they all rebelled.  It's what this entire world (and all the fake conspiracies) sets us up to disbelieve from childhood.  They put a straw man version of the truth (religion) in our face as a child then add Santa (Satan) Claus and all the rest of fake religion so that we dismiss the truth before we can even understand.


The truth is we have a perfect holy God who created us and he is so perfect and holy that things we think are ""no big deal"" (sin) he views with the kind of disgust we see in a child murdering pedophile.  We like to compare ourselves to other humans instead of him.


Because of our sinful state he has us separated from him in this place along with all these other fallen spiritual beings.  He used a people (Israel) to introduce himself back to humanity and to show us what sin is (by the law) and prove to us that no human can live up to his standards.   Because of this he himself became a human in the flesh of Jesus Christ (the man who is called Son of God) and allowed himself to be killed so his blood could be shed for us and his sacrifice would wash us clean from sin forever.  That way after our first death, we can be with him because he gave us his own righteousness via his merciful grace which we receive by coming to repentance and faith in this gospel:


1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 


They key here is realizing that none of us are good or righteous compared to God and only his perfect righteousness can save which we receive though repentance and belief in the above Gospel which is his death, burial, and Resurrection for your sins personally.


Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.


Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;


Our sin makes us deserving of the second (spiritual) death:


Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. 


God however is so merciful, loving, and forgiving he became like us laid down his life for us:


Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.


His blood cleanses us:


Rom_5:9  Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.


He is our righteousness:


Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 

Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.


All you need to do is admit that you are a guilty sinner and ask God to save you and he will just as you are right now:


2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.

Rom_10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Rom_10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.


Salvation is not of any good works, this the lie of every religion:


Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Eph 2:9  Not of works, lest any man should boast. 


Cry out telling God you know all of this to be true in your heart, that you understand what he did for you and ask him to save you and he will. 
 He will also send you the Holy Spirit to dwell in you!

If your data is structured for aggregating and selling, then it by definition needs fast and easy access for systems to quickly process large amounts of data.

If your data is structured for private accounts, it's much easier to secure individual accounts, and rate limit malicious actors from dumping a lot of data out in one go.

1195	"I think you have to start with deciding that at some point, learning to understand item affixes other character building systems is part of the hack and slash, Diablo-clone style games. At some point, a player is going to have to either go look something up on the internet or be willing to test whether item A or item B is better for them based on all of their other decisions. 

I think once you start there, it's about how you pace things out. This is where I think POE is slightly flawed, since you are instantly thrown into the passive tree, not to mention the item/skill systems. The player has to make a ton of decisions so immediately, which is really cool for someone trying to speed run or something like that, but confusing and frustrating for a new player. 

That said, D3's over simplified systems go too far in the other direction. The reason it's so easy for a new player to get going is because there are so few item affixes (split into primary and secondary, further simplifying things), then you have set and legendary powers, which also come from items. 

I think the answer is somewhere in between. for instance, Grim Dawns skill and devotion systems can be a bit much, but it's easy enough to change them. Last I played POE, you get some refund points but not enough to really learn without making a bunch of new characters. GD's item system also ramps up pretty slowly, with legendaries not even dropping until level 50. There are still learning curves, and there is some depth, but the player isn't thrown into the deep end immediately. Not that GD's systems are perfect, I just think they strike a decent balance of having depth but not being totally overwhelming for a new player. "	"""Endgame""

Infinite scaling with the same content. How can that be a good idea. Fuck, it literally asks people to bot in the game if they wanna be competitive  (which is a joke on its own, as at some point it literally only matters how many times you are willing to do the same thing over and over again.)

There is no creativity or whatsoever when it comes to game and content design, even from a business perspective.

We met online, I won't mention where as its very specific and she might see this thread so let's just say it's a bit like Reddit in the sense that it's just an online forum that we've been members of for a few years (not a dating forum).

She left the forum a few months ago because it was boring but she came back recently so she could post again. Anyway, she was round my place yesterday and she was using my computer and left her account logged in. I went to log her out so I could use my account but I noticed she had a PM that hadn't been read. My curiosity got the better of me so I opened her inbox. She was messaging this dude on the forum who is one of the more popular users, known for his wit and good looks.

Normally I don't have an issue when my girlfriend is messaging guys but this seemed odd to me. I opened a few of the messages and the conversation seemed friendly and casual; you know just making jokes and talking about college/work and the stuff they like to do, then I noticed they've been talking non\-stop for a couple of days now.

As I mentioned, they're talking as if they're friends and not flirting, but the volume of messages they're sending each other does worry me. In one message my girlfriend mentioned she has a boyfriend but they have talked about the kind of guys/girls they're into.

I don't know how I should feel about this. She's using the forum as normal, though I notice she's online more often than she makes posts. My anxiety is getting the better of me, I don't know if this is dodgy or what. It reminds me of when I first messaged my girlfriend on there, the conversation style is similar to that.

I talked to my friend who knows this guy and she told me that he's harmless and that I shouldn't worry.

1236	"I‚Äôm an atheist, but the question was interesting to think about. I thought sin is defined as being an act against the Christian God or (via Google)

&gt; an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law.

I will assume the claim that the Christian God is both omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent which I believe is the general accepted definition.

I guess it boils down to if everything God does is considered ‚Äúdivine law‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs impossible for him to sin in that definition, though not impossible for God to say change what ‚Äúdivine law‚Äù means namely one second it‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat shellfish‚Äù but the next second ‚Äúeating shellfish is ok‚Äù due to the claim of omnipotence.

If God is say below his own mandated law (God can sin) then he wouldn‚Äôt be omnipotent as God would be constrained by by his own mandate, so if we go with an omnipotent God I suppose the only answer is that everything God does is mandated divine law. Namely the Christian God is necessarily good to avoid violating the claim of omnipotence? 

Now I suppose a question of if God can‚Äôt sin and everything God does is mandated divine law, does that violate omnipotence since we‚Äôve basically discovered something that God can‚Äôt do. IMO no since sin by definition is going against divine law, it doesn‚Äôt say that God can‚Äôt do something he regrets. Just that the regrettable thing he did is something that was divine law at the time and he changed his mind so to speak.

Now I suppose the question is can an omniscient God actually change their mind as being omniscient would necessitate that God comprehends the consequences of his actions with 100% fidelity. I think it‚Äôs possible if you assume that God has the capacity to make both rational and irrational decisions due to omnipotence. So if God can make irrational choices then I believe he can do something he regrets.

So why or how would God do something he regrets? Well what if the irrational action was the benevolent one? If we assume God behaves benevolently, perhaps God must sometimes act irrationally to preserve acting benevolently? This would of course mean that divine law is therefore irrational since it‚Äôs impossible to know which laws were provided when God was acting rationally and when God was acting irrationally. So you can only have faith that in the end divine law consists of benevolent choices regardless of the rationality.

Obviously then questions of if God can be irrational, can he actually act benevolently  in all cases or are there cases where he does not act benevolently due to the fact that he can be irrational?

The follow up question of why follow an irrational God isn‚Äôt one I‚Äôm able to answer though."	That is the conclusion he came to in his mind even though its not what the comment is implying.  He has mutated it so he can defeat it.	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

1257	"*Resubmitted because I'm a doofus*

So the Curse of Ymir involves all Titan Shifters having a 13 year limit to their life once the Power of the Titan has been activated / used for the first time.

Now, I haven't read the full manga but from what I've read on the sub, while this hasn't been exactly proven, there is evidence in Titan Shifters appearing to age more through the years (the Fritz brothers were an example I think?).

What if there was a way to lengthen this limit?

Titan Shifting must take a lot of 'life force' from the person. We see this in superhuman settings in which if they use too much of their power, they can't use it any more and it drains their energy rapidly. That part we see in Eren, with Hange's experiments on how many times he can Shift without much break.

My best theory if this was a thing is: if they devour other Titans (mindless ones namely) then they add to their Shifter lifespan, due to the energy from P A T H S and that goodness. Perhaps if a Shifter devours another Shifter they also get this boost or reset, which Grisha wouldn't have known about (it may not be known about at all since they've been kept separate for so long) and couldn't have explored (since he had no time to).

This is just a theory and for fun! Does anybody have any thoughts on how it could work or other loopholes?"	Instant gratification isn‚Äôt the only story telling technique. Did you know that nobody knew how Harry Potter was going to end for seven whole books?	ShingekiNoKyojin	ShingekiNoKyojin	-1

1263	The more I see of Selesnya the less I like it. This is just a giant beater. No trample, no hexproof, nothing to protect it. I have to tap a lot of Mana and creatures to get some value out of it and then it simply dies to any hard removal? 	"I was writting a really long answer but after reconsidering I will just try to summarize my thoughts:

- Rogue Refiner is generally more valuable than Chupacabra and that is why it's a better card. That doesn't mean Rogue Refiner is always good and Chupacabra is not and that sets them in two different categories. That's like saying Glimmer of Genius is always good because it always puts you one card ahead and Vraska's Contempt is not. Then why don't all blue decks play 4 Glimmer? Rogue Refiner is raw card advantage, and as such is bad when you are under heavy pressure, the 3/2 doesn't help and you don't have the time or the mana to find the answers. 

- I don't see any reason to put Rogue Refiner and Whirler Virtuoso in the same category and not Chupacabra, power level aside. They're all a effect on a stick: one draws cards, other makes thopters and the last kills creatures. They're all situational: if I'm playing against a removal heavy deck I would rather have Rogue Refiner, if I'm playing against MonoRed I would rather have Virtuoso and if I'm playing against Baneslayers I would rather have Chupacabra.

- I'm sorry if I didn't explain myself well with the Hazoret thing. The way I see it there are roughly 4 kinds of creatures being played in Standard right now, or a combination of those: Effects on a stick/ETB (invalidates removal), hasty threats (requires instant removal), resilient threats (requires very specific removal), and cheap powerful/synergistic threats (they might not do anything the turn you cast them and are easy to kill, but they're still worth it). Hazoret is a combination of 2 and 3, but she needs set-up to be 2 and the meta has evolved to mitigate the value she provides. That's what I meant. And she doesn't invalidate removal, she's 50% the reason Vraska's Contempt is the most played card in Standard.

- As long as you have good creatures from those 4 categories, putting Baneslayer-like creatures in your deck is a bad deckbuilding decision. The first category punishes the opponent for having too much 1-for-1 removal, the second punishes him for not having instant removal at the right time, the third punishes him for not having specific kinds of removal, and the fourth punishes him for not having early removal.

1266	It depends on what aspect you focus on, and the perspective. Is it immoral to provide a legal way to watch Japanese anime for western audience easily? Or provide simulcasts etc... Should stores stop selling bananas because people who harvested those bananas are exploited? Idk, but it's definitely not black and white. It's also in a way on consumers to not buy bananas, if they dont want stores to stock them. But hypothetically, it's possible those exploited workers, would otherwise starve and die without that job, so would doing something, that results in that fate for them, be really a more moral action?	"As someone who rated Your Lie in April as a 10 and it is currently my favourite anime I've ever seen, I do admit it has it flaws. Side characters left to dry and flashbacks like you mentioned, but also the use of Kaori hitting Kousei as well after what he went through in his childhood could be seen as very wrong.

Personally however, I was attracted from the first episode. Kousei as a character intrigued me, possibly due to me being in a bit of a dark place at the time, but to see someone who struggled to do the things he loved because of the guilt and pain really resonated with me and it still does whenever I rewatch it.

Additionally, I loved Kaori, Tsubaki and Watari. I believe that while they could have developed more, their magic was in how they helped develop Kousei and progress his character along. He starts the anime as a kid who's too afraid to play the piano after everything that happened in his life, but at the end he plays the piano and FOR Kaori. He bonds with Tsubaki over their childhood and how she's always been a constant in his life. He bonds with Watari as he realises that his girlfriend actually likes Kousei more than him, and instead of feeling bitter about it he nudges them together towards the end of the anime.

The music is a no brainer. The compositions made for the anime are beautiful, and 'Again' is still in my playlist because I love that song. 

The artstyle can be quite striking at times, admittedly, however when the animators get it right in some of the scenes and blend it together well it looks beautiful.

I love this anime, and I've not found anything that affected me as emotionally in the 2 years I've been watching anime, but I know why it wouldn't cater to other people. Not every anime is for everyone and thats the beauty of the medium. "	anime	anime	-1

Where I‚Äôm from we believe that it‚Äôs the three wise kings (from the nativity) that bring the gifts to children, so I guess I‚Äôll tell THAT story.    
One time, when I was 7, I really wanted this PSONE video game called Eretzvaju. It was a fighting game with an anime character in the cover, but I only wanted because said character had huge boobies (although I guess I always liked anime stuff as a kid).    
Anyways, my mom didn‚Äôt get it for me because I never actually told her about it and one  time while we were at the mall I start shit-talking the three wise kings. My mom asks me what‚Äôs up with that, and I tell her that what I actually wanted was the game in question.    
Well, a week later I wake up to the game on my window and a note (in my mother‚Äôs distinctly feminine handwriting) from ‚ÄúMelchior, Caspar &amp; Balthazar‚Äù telling me not to call them stuff I only told my mother. Now, I was never told these guys were all knowing, so my first instinct was to assume that they somehow had direct communication with my mother. So I told my mom essentially asking her why would she gossip about with these guys and she said she didn‚Äôt, that they must‚Äôve ‚Äújust known‚Äù. This didn‚Äôt sit well with me at all. I started playing the game but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how my mother had lied to me about rating me out to these guys. And as I was meditating on that while I played the game, I somehow made the logical leap of her lying to me about gossiping to her lying to me about their existence period.

Base XP is earned for completing main and optional objectives during the mission.

**Bonus XP**
Bonuses multiply the value of your Base XP.  Examples include:
*Difficulty Bonus*
*Random Map Bonus*

**Boost XP**
Boosts multiply the combined total value of your Base and Bonus XP.  Examples include:
*War Chest Boost*
*Co-op Stimpack Boost*

**Bounty XP**

Sorry, I had assumed that you understood that there are more ways and topics to protest, and more protest groups, than just those engaging in partisan political activities.

&gt;Can we go back to how you've painted anti-abortionists as downtrodden voices silenced by the government akin to gay rights activists? That idea is so ludicrous it genuinely makes me want to know more about how you picture it, especially as you've dodged my questioning about it twice now.

I hadn't responded to it the first time because it hadn't been a question the first time. You had stated it as your impression of what I said, and since that wasn't the topic, I didn't want to derail onto it. If you really want to discuss that part of my earlier comment, if you re-read what I wrote I had not painted them in any such way.

The user I was responding to had made a statement about how (to paraphrase) these groups should shut up and get lost because majority opinion rules. To illustrate the danger of that thinking, I had shown how at one time that very argument could have been directed towards the political opposites of these groups now being closed out of this funding. Had we entrenched ourselves in that thinking, abortion would have never been legalized, and neither would have same-sex marriage.

I had not been drawing comparisons between these groups, but rather to how refusing to allow dissenting opinion can hamstring us as a society by limiting ourselves to listening only to majority opinion. We would become an echo chamber, and cultural development through social progress would cease to occur.

&gt;Do you think these groups would be ok with the government giving them their hired protestor money in exchange for an equal amount being spent targetting the human right of freedom of religion? And then what would they think when the next government comes in and uses the precedence of a-oking protest money against human rights for another pet cause?

There are already advocacy groups out there aiming to decrease the influence religion has on society, including the limits of freedom of religion. And so there should be. I'm betting that these groups are peeved that they get money, but it's only fair to allow their viewpoint to be heard as well.

We need people arguing for and against topics in order to determine where we ourselves stand on the subject. We need to be offended at times to be able to appreciate the depth of our own beliefs or viewpoints, or to grab our attention so we become aware that there *are* other opinions. As I had mentioned in that earlier comment, there are few things more dangerous to a healthy democracy than disallowing dissent."

"The overall difference in benign and malignant (aka cancerous) tumors is their lack of response to regulatory signals and potential to spread to other parts of the body ('metastasize'). The science behind the exact driving force of what triggers a benign mole to become malignant and cancerous isn't really clear, unfortunately, and it almost certainly is multifactorial. It likely depends on exactly which mutations occur and what the downstream effects of those damages are. One promising target that some Penn researchers published a few years ago is a protein called p15, but research keeps evolving to discover exactly which genes, which proteins, which signals have to 'go wrong' in order to turn something harmless like a mole into a malignant melanoma.

"First date she was almost 2 hours late. She texted saying she‚Äôs hanging out with friends. We eventually met up and had a decent time. So I tried to give her a chance. Yesterday we agreed to meet at 4:30. At the last minute she mentions she wants to eat somewhere and then meet up. I tell her I‚Äôm at x location (a restaurant) at 4:30 hurry up and get here. She tells me she‚Äôs on the way. We had just had a discussion about why I felt disrespected after the first time. It took me less than 20 minutes to get there from same location. 

After eating dinner by myself, paying and going to the restroom. I come back and she‚Äôs sitting there. Showed up at 6. I didn‚Äôt say hi or anything. I just walked out. Now she‚Äôs texting me asking me where I am. I explain to her again about respect etc.  I said I gave you a chance and you blew it.  Now she calling me a psycho for bailing on her. 

I feel like I did the right thing. Am I wrong? Am I the asshole?

Edit:

I think it is important that we have these discussions about how we can ensure that admission to medical school is an equitable process for those from all social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I am the first person from my family to attend University and growing up no one in my social circle was in medicine. Regardless, I still feel incredibly privileged to have been admitted to medical school and have had the opportunity to pursue the activities that helped me gain admission. Although I would say that from my experience, family income is not an insurmountable barrier to these opportunities! My family is incredibly supportive of the work I do but I personally wanted to self-fund my education. In Canada (and at UBC), I think this is entirely possible due to tuition becoming quite subsidized (compared to medical schools in other countries), student loans are very accessible, and most of the research I've done has been funded by the University or external research awards. UBC Medicine recently posted about their MCAT assistance program that will help lower the costs for students with financial hardship (http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2017/11/01/mcat-fee-assistance-program-for-canadians/)

Regarding your comment about residency placement - I would say from my knowledge, financial or family resources become even less of a consideration at this point. Life experience is not just about traveling the world and I would say facing hardship (whatever it is) gives you plenty of life experience :) Also, your amicability is entirely dependent on you and not what privilege you may have!

I'm not saying this is a perfect system, and undoubtedly it is unfortunate that some groups have a tougher time getting into medical school and succeeding in medicine. However, I do think the system makes an effort to level the playing field and it is entirely possible to build an awesome CV (and career) regardless of your background! "	IAmA	IAmA	-1

There doesn't seem to be evidence to suggest the former, but there is some evidence to suggest the latter. 

The brain is still very much undiscovered by humans, we are very far from fully understanding it. However, there are studies about the effects of prayer/meditation on brain activity and how it may be linked to improving attention and focus. For example, one area of the brain that sees activity during prayer is the Posterior Cingulate Cortex 

""Probably the dominant current theory of PCC function is that it is directly involved in some aspect of internally directed thought ([Binder *et al.*, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B7); [Buckner *et al.*, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B16)). One early hypothesis was that the PCC plays a role in supporting the semantic elements of ‚Äòstimulus-independent‚Äô thought ([Binder *et al.*, 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B7)). Activity in the PCC was higher when subjects report more ‚Äòstimulus-independent‚Äô thoughts, a state where mental activity is unconstrained by external stimuli. [Binder *et al.* (1999)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/#awt162-B7) proposed that the PCC, along with other DMN regions such as lateral inferior parietal regions, are continually involved in the conceptual processing associated with this type of freewheeling mental activity. In this state semantic knowledge is retrieved, maintained in awareness and manipulated for the purposes of problem solving and planning.""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3891440/)

Therefore prayer helps relieve stress, and allows the brain to reset. Maybe that helped you approach the mathematical problem with a new light? I'm not sure but at least it's one reasonable possibility grounded in reality.

Furthermore, it's not just prayer among religious people that have produced results, the same patter of brain activity has been seen in atheist and non-religious people who meditate. I'm not a brain surgeon or anything, just an avid reader. A few google searches on the subject of brain activity during prayer/meditation will bring up some interesting articles and studies. 

I'm not trying to strip away your conviction, after all it has also been argued that the intensity of brain activity depended on the strength of ones faith. I just think it's important that we look at causality, i.e. *perceived result* of prayer vs. *act* of prayer. That being said, if prayer resonates with you and helps you achieve what you want in life, then I say go for it, but just be careful when preaching to others about absolute truths when there is still so much to learn."

1306	"What you say matches the statistics well enough. There are lots of interesting aspects, men are more likely to kill, women are more likely to use weapons. Lesbians are slightly more violent than heterosexuals, gays slightly less. We could discuss the disparities in reporting and prosecution by gender and probably not agree any interpretation so there's little purpose to that.

What I wanted to pick up on was ""why there are more resources for female victims"". The proportion of DV that ends in murder is tiny, less than 1%, statistically insignificant. However, nearly all of the resources are aimed at women. Whatever you consider the relative weight of risk, its not enough to justify women being the only concern in practice.

1318	"So for those who don't know, Tupac '2Pac' Shakur was a v famous rapper who got slain in a driveby in Vegas. There's a whole big conspiracy theory that it was faked and he's still alive, and people discuss things such as the hit-car never being found and cremation before autopsy blah blah. I'm not here about that gritty stuff, but about the lyrical/textual clues that when compounded are quite interesting.. even suggestive. 

2pacs lyrics were littered with references to immortality and resurrection, and about how he hated being famous and had many enemies and worried for his life. e.g.:

'even if they kill me they could never take the life of a real g'

at the end of one of his albums after a long period of silence, he even speaks the following lines:

""Expect me, n***a, expect me like you expect jesus to come back""

While many rappers do big themselves up and even create an air of mystery around themselves, the level to which 2pac's work is saturated with references to the horrors of fame and rivalry + immortality is quite outstanding. 

This brings me on to his later stage name, Makaveli Tha Don. As the legend has it, Pac read Niccolo Macchiavelli's The Prince while doing a short spell in prison. There's all sorts of BS about macchiavelli advocating faking ones own death, but what The Prince is about in-part is politics and rivalry which includes a lot of deception. 

To digress for a moment, since Pac's death, there have been two notable rappers that have been extremely elusive and sound very similar to 2Pac. One is Blac Haze, who released an album called Re-sa-rec-shun (resurrection) in 1998, not long after Pacs death. The other is Kasinova Tha Don, seemingly more recent with music videos on youtube. 

Both of these rappers have a similar flow, diction, vocabulary, accent, and subject matter to Tupac, and many people argue that they are Tupac. Neither of them tour, neither of them have a clear consistent public profile and despite their clear talent they don't seem to have made much of a name for themselves outside of 2pac fanworld. Kasinova Tha Don is a clear mimicking of Makaveli Tha Don (Casanova also being an Italian renaissance writer like Macchiavelli), yet there is no clear tribute to tupac in Kasinova's lyrics. 

Returning the focus to Pac, his choice of spelling for Macchiavelli/Makaveli is interesting. It's an anagram of Am Alive + K. Although the K seems random, it suddenly seems quite coincidental that Blac Haze is missing a K and Kasinova Tha Don altered the spelling of Casanova to use a K. 

It could be a coincidence and wishful thinking, or it could be a series of clues left for his fans. 

That's all. nothing more, just some stuff.

Thank you for the book and the AMA. How should newer mobile app creators think about growth? It seems like a slow and steep uphill battle. Would you agree? App Store Optimization won't get you to top 10 search results on the app store. SEO doesn't seem to be that relevant for apps. Content-driven downloads are also low. Reaching initial users through ads with a product that is optimized for organic growth seems to be the only way out. What do you think?"

The approach taken by Dart, Java and most statically typed languages makes classes first class citizens in the sense that they participate at compile time in the elaboration of the type system. This means that the type system is static, it's an intrinsic property of the program.

In JavaScript or Python on the other hand, the type system is dynamic. It depends on the execution of the program and gets ""populated"" at runtime. In this regard, classes are not a first-class citizen. What makes classes a first class citizen in these languages is the fact that they are first-class values. Classes can be mutated, assigned to variables, stored into data structures, fall out of scope, created in loops etc. This makes them first class citizen but in a very different way.

Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses. The static one allows the compiler to guarantee that every variable or argument will always have the correct type since it's impossible to compile the program if the type system is incoherent. Using a dynamic approach opens a lot of opportunities for metaprogramming, allowing you to shape the type system as your program executes."	programming	programming	-1

If you watch pornography for example, you are taking part in something that involves evil and darkness, those girls are selling their bodies for your entertainment, it's a hard habit to quit, but it's probably what holds most of us back from becoming who we want to be. You probably shouldn't go back to using the plant if you are going to get addicted again, try to fill the time you would normally spend using it with prayer or meditation, build a relationship with God and the Savior, that is something more rewarding than anything else in this world.	"The prevailing view (in Catholicism anyway, but this applies to other religions) used to be that people who committed suicide were certainly not going to Heaven as they had committed a mortal sin while of sound mind, and then would have no time to repent (being dead). However with the improvement in knowledge of mental health, we now know a lot of the people committing suicide are plagued by mental illness and are not of sound mind, or perhaps their mind is clouded by physical pain etc.. As such, it is possible that they go to Heaven (or Purgatory, if that's your kinda thing).

To my knowledge, euthanasia (essentially what you'd be doing to yourself) isn't explicitly mentioned in the Bible, you'll have to find your own interpretation of that one.

But I do always caution people. I think about all the breakups, all the ways in which people reveal themselves to be bad for you, and how terrible it would be to have to face that kind of ex in the workplace, or leave a job you like because of such a breakup. Not to mention the things shitty co-workers or bosses may say about the relationship, or bring your personal business into your work life despite you keeping it strictly professional within the work place. I think the policy of ""don't shit where you eat"" has a lot of merit because of all the things you don't know when you get into a relationship. Maybe your cute co-worker is an amazing partner who  you can spend the rest of your life with, or maybe they're a horrid stalker who misrepresents you to your boss or undermines your work effort once they become an ex. You can roll the dice, with no idea what the outcome ends up being. It's a risk you take in any relationship but usually that doesn't impact your work life.

He has a little more flexibility since he doesn't have them full time but he's still a parent and his kids will still always be his priority. Or at least they should be. It's unrealistic to think that you can date him without being at least a little bit of a parent yourself.

I agree that comping is a very useful tool, but I wouldn't say it's that cut and dry - or at the very least, I don't think one needs to comp every line or whatever to get the best out of your recorded performance.  There are some songs that I think benefit from the artist doing it all (or very large chunks) of the vocals in one take, it can add to the intimacy of the recording which can sometimes be nice if it pairs with the song's themes.

But yeah it certainly is the best way to do it these days.  And besides, sometimes seeing how an artist plays a song live is part of the live-experience.  Sometimes it's nice being surprised at how they change it up.  If you go to a concert expecting it to sound *exactly* like the album version you're going for the wrong reasons."	videos	videos	-1

I wasn't trying to make this a separate argument, so I don't see where you can consider I was ""moving goal posts"". I was using our solar system as a sample of the entire universe, nothing more than that.

""Second, we don't know that no life currently or ever existed on any of the planets or moons in our own solar system.""

You kind of lost me here. With this statement you're essentially saying that any planet can contain life, regardless of it's disposition. This is an illogical statement to make. However yes, it can be safely said that intelligent life has never existed in our Solar System other than on Earth. Even if at some point the most minimal ""life"" form existed on Mars, it's widely agreed upon that it is no longer there, thus it could not sustain itself.

""From our insanely limited perspective it might appear as though the universe was fine tuned for us, when in fact, evolution fine tuned us to exist in this particular set of circumstances.""

So then why bother looking for habitable planets with this logic, as you're essentially saying that any planet has the ability to be habitable.

You're making very very thin illogical arguments here, unless I'm somehow deeply misunderstanding you.

Viewing all large websites as ""needing to monetise eventually"" views the world through a lens where every large website is operating as a business and needs to break even. This just isn't true, and lots of large websites operate at a cost that is not earned back by any function of the website (whether encouraging subscriptions or donations or ad views, etc.).

Again, it's not that it's strictly *incorrect* in that you could say the website helps the organisation function and gain funds in other ways (in a government's case, the website may be part of its duties to its citizens which get paid for through tax), but it is certainly kinda weird to view all websites through that lens.

Consumers haven‚Äôt had to pay these taxes on their broadband bills because broadband Internet access service has never before been a Title II service. But now it is. And so the Order explicitly opens the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband. As the Order frankly acknowledges, Title II ‚Äúauthorizes the Commission to impose universal service contributions requirements on telecommunications carriers‚Äîand, indeed, goes even further to require ‚Äò[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides interstate telecommunications services‚Äô to contribute.‚Äù36 And so the FCC now has a statutory obligation to make sure that all Internet service providers (and in the end, their customers) contribute to the Universal Service Fund.

1402	"I‚Äôm an atheist, but the question was interesting to think about. I thought sin is defined as being an act against the Christian God or (via Google)

&gt; an immoral act considered to be a transgression against divine law.

I will assume the claim that the Christian God is both omnipotent, omniscient, and benevolent which I believe is the general accepted definition.

I guess it boils down to if everything God does is considered ‚Äúdivine law‚Äù meaning it‚Äôs impossible for him to sin in that definition, though not impossible for God to say change what ‚Äúdivine law‚Äù means namely one second it‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat shellfish‚Äù but the next second ‚Äúeating shellfish is ok‚Äù due to the claim of omnipotence.

If God is say below his own mandated law (God can sin) then he wouldn‚Äôt be omnipotent as God would be constrained by by his own mandate, so if we go with an omnipotent God I suppose the only answer is that everything God does is mandated divine law. Namely the Christian God is necessarily good to avoid violating the claim of omnipotence? 

Now I suppose a question of if God can‚Äôt sin and everything God does is mandated divine law, does that violate omnipotence since we‚Äôve basically discovered something that God can‚Äôt do. IMO no since sin by definition is going against divine law, it doesn‚Äôt say that God can‚Äôt do something he regrets. Just that the regrettable thing he did is something that was divine law at the time and he changed his mind so to speak.

Now I suppose the question is can an omniscient God actually change their mind as being omniscient would necessitate that God comprehends the consequences of his actions with 100% fidelity. I think it‚Äôs possible if you assume that God has the capacity to make both rational and irrational decisions due to omnipotence. So if God can make irrational choices then I believe he can do something he regrets.

So why or how would God do something he regrets? Well what if the irrational action was the benevolent one? If we assume God behaves benevolently, perhaps God must sometimes act irrationally to preserve acting benevolently? This would of course mean that divine law is therefore irrational since it‚Äôs impossible to know which laws were provided when God was acting rationally and when God was acting irrationally. So you can only have faith that in the end divine law consists of benevolent choices regardless of the rationality.

Obviously then questions of if God can be irrational, can he actually act benevolently  in all cases or are there cases where he does not act benevolently due to the fact that he can be irrational?

The follow up question of why follow an irrational God isn‚Äôt one I‚Äôm able to answer though."	"Selection bias and survival bias are the problems here.

If you research this further, you will discover that they were even more theists at the begin of their education. 

So learning philosophy of religion has made the group *less* religious. 

Also those who didn't manage to keep their beliefs probably sooner or later changed to some other career path. Imagine starting to study alchemy, homeopathy and snake oilology, and then realizing they are hoaxes. If you are even slightly moral, you will start considering other careers. And if you don't, your whole career is based on people believing in these hoaxes, so obviously it would be rational for you to report that you believe in them.

I would imagine that [the sunken cost fallacy/escalation of commitment is also at play here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment). ""*Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.*""

I would prefer actual real debate about things we could do. I‚Äôm sure there is a lot of variables other than banning any guns yet so many people just flat out refuse any possible debate. Our system was designed to find a middle road between extreme sides and that requires debate. 

IMO, memes like this are designed to just kill debate by refusing to see the loads of grey between the white and black sides. It uses an emotional jab to undercut debate. Sure, a large aspect of the 2nd is about personal gun ownership, but part of the 2nd is about giving regular citizens the fighting chance to rise up against a government they view as out of control. 

I firmly believe both aspects of the 2nd should be upheld. But I also feel that something could likely be done to help reduce danger at schools (and other places). Positions that try to just shut down debate is flat out wrong and a danger to our liberty. If someone feels that just discussing options is a bad move then I feel as if that position is even worse than actually banning a type of gun.

1449	"I've read plenty of articles like that (and just read the one you posted). Just cause stupid fashion designers have decided to ride on ""faux environmentalism"" for profit does not mean plastic bags are good. That's an issue with human nature and our inexplicable ability to monetize and over produce something just for profit regardless of environmental impact. 

Keeping as much plastic out of the system is still good. I live in a very, very green city. Most stores charge 5¬¢ or 10¬¢ for a plastic bag and that is enough to deter cheapskates or encourage everyone else to bring reusable bags. I use reusable bags to the ground and then recycle them. They are also large and practical. Not for fashion. 

We have a good recycling system and there are plenty of private companies that service many businesses or large apartment buildings. Textiles are even accepted by many companies so I can recycle old tote bags. We have city wide composting and it's been amazing the last few years to see people really embracing it and it's not just hippies. 

Banning plastic is still a step in the right direction because lots of people won't consume less unless it disrupts their entrenched habits. You have to start somewhere and we are unfortunately still in baby steps mode teaching people how to do these things.

The only way to change things radically would be to hit way higher up on the food chain -- employers and companies producing or encouraging wasteful activities. Such as over producing tote bags cause it is trendy. Nobody asked for trendy tote bags. It just became a fad because of that one designer.

If human beings cared less about being trendy... The fashion industry is the third most wasteful industry in the world by far. They produce advertising and marketing to brainwash people into believing they need new clothes every season. Fashion trends or styles used to stay for 50 to 100 years centuries ago. Now a store can change their inventory once a week or every two weeks. That's crazy wasteful.

If they have determined that pro-consumer corporate structure is what makes the most money - as it would seem to be the case, given that this is the direction they chose to adopt at the height of a hostile takeover - then there is no incentive to change that. 

If anything, the takeover attempt incentivized them to focus *even more* on short term gains, in order to fend off Vivendi.

1488	"It's not misogyny. It's just a biological reality. Look, human beings *evolved* a certain way. Walking on two legs had a lot of advantages. But it had disadvantages too, like it made it a *lot* harder to give birth. For 99% of mammals, the mother raises her offspring alone. Human beings are different in that we almost always have the male help with the raising of the offspring. We *evolved* to do this, because raising a child takes a very long time and requires a lot of resources. Most mammals will spend about 5-10% of their total lifespan as ""children"" where their survival is dependent upon the mother. For human beings it's about 33% of our total life span. 

So, this put different evolutionary pressures on males and females when it comes to reproduction. We all have the instinct to pass on our genes to future generations. It's difficult to do so, we have a limited time frame to do it, and when we're robbed of that ability, we see it as a great harm. 

This is why we see rape as something awful. Women have to be very choosy in who they have a child with. If she's going to need help from the male, then she needs to know that male won't bail on her. That he will commit to her. We see rape as awful because the male is taking away her ability to choose a mate who will provide the support she needs to raise a child. The *instinct* and *desire* for a mate who can support her exists, regardless of whether she has a child or not. It's a *subconscious* desire that she has no control over. Women evolved to have this desire to best ensure the survival of her own genes. 

For men, there's another problem. Women *always* know if her baby is hers. But men can't know. If a man raises a child that he unknowingly puts a lot of resources into raising, but does not carry on his own genes, then he has wasted his resources. 

This is why men *evolved* to value sexual fidelity in women. The fewer partners she has, the more he can *instinctively* trust her, and know he's not wasting his time giving her his resources. The biological equivolent of raping a man is telling a man it's his baby when it's not. This is why men *highly* value women who have had the least number of sexual partners as possible. The more partners she has, the more likely his resources he gives her is wasted. This is why the biggest reason a guy has for breaking up with a girl is finding out how many guys she's been with in the past. "	Then look up how to gain some muscle, bro.

Such a shame it‚Äôs not in iOS but if the performance boost is all they say, I‚Äôll allow it."	"In that case, we may see the 8/8+ dropped this year in lieu of the new LCD iPhone's release. The SE might also bite the bullet, cleaning up the iPhone line to 2 models - 1 entry-level, 1 high-end (kind of like the regular/pro variants with the Macs and iPads). 

Given that they have made the non-Pro iPad more powerful this year, it seems like they are using it to target the education market, which puts the 10.5"" iPad Pro in a weird spot. It still has a better display and a faster SoC (I think), but its size advantage is starting to be nullified by the non-Pro iPad's newfound Pencil support. Getting rid of the 10.5"" iPad Pro leaves the 12.9"" iPad Pro as the ""Pro"" device - the laptop replacement, which makes sense given its size. The regular iPad, which I think is 9.7"", remains the standard iPad that everyone knows and loves, and at its price, it remains a compelling option for people who want a tablet but don't need the faster refresh rate or other bells and whistles of the Pro line.

That would leave us with:

* 2 laptops (MacBook, MacBook Pro)

* 3 desktops (iMac, iMac Pro, Mac Pro)

* 2 iPhones (LCD 2018, X2)

* 2 iPads (regular, 12.9"" Pro)

Almost symmetrical, and it would be if they just completely scrapped the Mac Pro, but I think there's still quite a few people out there that like the idea of the Mac Pro and want to see an updated version. Alternatively, the iMac Pro in its current form could just be a stopgap measure, and the form factor (AIO pro device) could be retired when the new Mac Pro is announced. The new Mac Pro would then take the name of ""iMac Pro"" while retaining the non-AIO form factor that is more useful to content creators and professionals that want to upgrade their machines over time. Apple would, theoretically, release new displays to go along with the re-designed iMac/Mac Pro, but that's a different story."	apple	apple	-1

**16**¬†So the Jewish leaders began harassing\[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A15-20&amp;version=NLT#fen-NLT-26192a)\] Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules. **17**¬†But Jesus replied, ‚ÄúMy Father is always working, and so am I.‚Äù** 1**8¬†So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.

**19**¬†So Jesus explained, ‚ÄúI tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does. **20**¬†For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. In fact, the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man. Then you will truly be astonished.

If you slap my wife and then I in turn murder your family in front of you and then burn down your village and salt the land, now that doesn't seem benevolent does it?  Or even fair in any way? 

I've actually had the same problem as op.  I'm reading the bible in church and see a passage where god tells the Hebrews to destroy an entire city and kill every man, woman, and child (can't remember what their crime was but it wasn't that bad).  I look up at all the people in church and think how can I and everyone else worship this god if this is true.  

I've dealt with this by looking at the bible for what it is; a book of tales, some partially true, the rest mostly false, that illustrate the history of a group of people.  

The thing is, most organized religions have so many flaws that I'm amazed at how they've flourished and even intensified past the age of reason and science.

Imagine an extremely large zone - much like how they ""redesigned"" Outland - only this would be a ravaged Azeroth with only smaller portions of the continents accessible. And all of these smaller accessible areas would be rebuilt as the Black Empire. Successful campaigns against the Black Empire throughout the expansion would expand access to additional areas on Azeroth.

1531	"The honest answer is that in Oklahoma there was a referendum on taxes in 1992. People voted that there must be a \*\*75% majority\*\* in congress to pass any new taxes. Thus, we just recently passed the first tax increase in \*\*28 YEARS\*\*. As a result, our infrastructure is crumbling, education is in free fall (both public schools and universities), prisons are overcrowded, and the highway patrol is having to ration fuel and only patrol certain stretches of highway.

This is a crisis of choice. We don't have to live like this. Oklahoma is ranked 30th in GDP by state and 28th in population. So middle of the pack. We're one of the larger small states (if that makes sense). Yet we have the 47th lowest total tax burden and rank 50th in education funding.

"What's worrying me is that there's no progress towards a better life for either of you. There's being frugal but then there's a point where you're purposely choosing unfavorable conditions to be cheap. Not lifestyle creep, but being frugal while still having an enjoyable life, choosing a reasonably priced apartment in an alright part of town instead of a shitty apartment in a shitty (possibly unsafe due to crime) part of town.

 Don't either of you have any dreams or ambitions of what kind of life you want in your later years? I'm not talking unreasonable ones like being a millionaire with a mansion, but reasonable things like a solid career, perhaps a house, a spouse/family of your own. What steps are you taking to reach your goals, how are you going to utilize your present situation to improve your future?

While I think this plan could be okay short term for saving money to get a good start at life, making your life codependent into your brothers is a really poor choice, especially if it's for the long term like you're implying. If something happens to either of you, or if one of you decides to move forward in life the other is basically screwed. You need to go into frugality with a plan and a reason for making sacrifices for the sake of saving money, or its not going to be sustainable.

Smiling Proud Wanderer - main character is caught and torn between the ""good"" side and ""evil"" side of the martial world. I really enjoyed the love story between him and the girl from the evil sect.

The Deer and the Cauldron - main character is a witty one that doesn't know any martial arts but learns as the story progresses. He ends up with seven wives.

Edit: Legend of the Condor Heros focus around a naive, loyal, righteous male character. He falls in love with a smart and courageous female character. Their interactions/love story is one of my favorites."	"**Song of Achilles, by Madeline Miller**

1549	I agree with your dismay. Dany is probably the character we can most easily plot out what she needs to do in TWOW because certain things have obviously been set up (uniting the Dothraki, dealing with Illyrio, some follow up on Volantis, and of course Meereen and Slaver's Bay). It is why I have been saying for years that our best hope for Dany is for her to make it to Westeros at the tail end of TWOW. Even then her story would have to move fairly swiftly considering that there are 19 other POVs. Remember that the second Dance of Dragons was only meant to be GRRM's second act. There are still the White Walkers. Dany's story is a big reason why some of us do not see a way for GRRM to finish this in seven books.	In the third book they go into some detail about how the Wildings are always raiding and crossing over.  There is breaks in the wall and ways to sail around it.  It isn't a stretch to believe a person who has walked the wall a number of times wouldn't know of it's inherent weaknesses.

1553	"&gt; It's still somewhat questionable, insofar as one could raise the question of whether the decision to constantly cast straight actors as gay characters (while already dominating the ""market"" of straight characters) ends up making it unjustifiably harder for actual gay actors to advance in their careers.

But by saying that you are saying that one of the marketable qualities of a gay actor is that he is gay. If straight people having roles as gay characters are limiting the market for gay actors, then that suggests that you think gay actors should play gay characters. What's wrong with gay and straight actors playing gay and straight roles? That's what's happening in Hollywood anyway; gay actors and actresses have played straight roles for decades. There are a lot of famous gay people in Hollywood, and none of them seem to struggle for work. None of them really let their sexuality define them either. They're not ""a gay actor"", they're just actors. 

I find it a highly dubious claim that gay people struggle to advance their career because straight people are ""stealing"" their roles.

And all this is neglecting the fact that it is the job of actors to inhibit a role and take on the characteristics of someone not like themselves. That's the entire point of acting. By saying that being trans is a trait that defines this character and that the trait cannot possibly be portrayed by someone who isn't genuinely trans in real life, then I think you are in a roundabout way belittling the entire profession of acting.

You say people have been vocal about this issue in the past, and I am sure they have, but I don't really think it's a good thing when the result is something like this. A highly marketable actress leaves a role, and the project is left dead in the water and currently it is unknown if it will continue at all. So now instead of having a cis person playing a trans role, we have no trans role at all instead."

"&gt;I'm not trying to be a dick here, but you are just wrong about this. You're just 100% wrong. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate in the 2016 election and winner of the popular vote, has explicitly endorsed ""Australia-style mandatory buybacks."" Mandatory, meaning confiscation. She's hardly the only one.

Well, 1) I hadn't heard of it, and I'm surprised, and I thought I was following the campaign well, and 2) all I could find was [this](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-gun-buybacks_us_56216331e4b02f6a900c5d67) where she says ""it's worth considering"" without going into the details of what and how and where. 

I understand that you think the laws they have in Australian are authoritarian, and I disagree, and we'll drop it at there. The point I want to make is that all Hilary said was ""maybe we should do something like that"" and automatically people jump to ""they're grabbing ALL YOUR GUNS!!!"" Australian can still have guns - they're just restricted in which kinds, and need to have permits. 

&gt;This is nonsense, through and through. What you're essentially saying is ""you can defend yourself from armed criminals, but you have to be significantly outgunned because they won't comply with the laws and you have to."" It completely nullifies the purposes of the second amendment, and thoroughly violates both the spirit and the letter of it.

Well I mean, I see your argument. But, that's true of anything, isn't it? I can't make a bomb, criminals can, how can I protect myself if there's such a disadvantage?

Where we differ is I don't think it's very likely you are to actually need to defend yourself. I live in the inner city of a major crime-ridden city, and I still have yet to feel the need to arm myself, or know anyone who is armed. The people I do know who are armed, live in the country away from any invaders, and have never been in a dangerous situation either. Even if I was armed, unless I was facing a single attacker, I sincerely doubt it would do much good. That argument just fails to convince me, I'm afraid. As far as I'm concerned, you're going to be outgunned anyway. 

Such scenarios are simply completely outside my realm of experience. But more than that - they're completely outside the realm of experience of everyone I know in this country - to the point that I suspect it's not actually something that happens to regular people, but that people worry about it in the hypothetical.

I'm legitimately much more concerned that any wacko can get himself kitted like Neo in the lobby scene of the matrix, and get his 15-150 minutes of revenge fantasy before the SWAT teams take them down/force them to commit suicide.

&gt;The truck attack in Nice killed 86 and injured 258. Deadlier than the worst mass shooting we've had.

Jesus. Guess I was wrong. 

Still, I'd rather restrict mass murderer's options, rather than give them as many as they want.

&gt; If you immigrated here and you want us to be more like the country that you came from, I just can't respect your perspective at all.

That's alright. You don't have to respect it. I have the right to speak, like anyone else, and in the context that I (or my children) could one day be the victim of a mass shooting like any other american, speak I will. The US is a free country after all, with liberty of expression common to all Western countries, and I don't require your respect to speak, but I will not silence myself. Personally, I think you could use a different perspective, but that's just me.

In Rust, the self-contained ""unit"" of code is the entire crate

If compilation units/crates were sufficient for code organization then we wouldn't have modules. Regardless of what libraries are depended upon by the crate itself, I find it useful when skimming unfamiliar codebases to narrow down the module that I want to examine and begin understanding its responsibilities by seeing which libraries it uses (given the reasonable assumption that a given library or module tends to have a well-defined responsibility). For me, the time that I care about the names that get imported is after I've begun reading the code below and want to source the provenance of something unfamiliar. Top-down vs. bottom-up, perhaps.

&gt; You can do that in most modern languages, yet almost none allow for this kind of nested import trees. (Possible exceptions may include ES6). The fact that they are possible in Rust strikes me more as a coincidence stemming from the particular import syntax

I draw the opposite conclusion here: the reason other languages don't support it isn't because they've considered it and rejected it, but because it doesn't flow naturally from their particular import syntax.

&gt; the ""pain"" is actually quite bearable, I suspect that once you account for all the extra braces and newlines, the resulting import block won't really be shorter than what you'd get if you just delineated each item in its own use statement.

1594	"It's an interesting and complex topic. The book that kicked off the ancient aliens idea in pop culture was ""Chariots of the gods?"" By Swiss author Erich von D√§nkien. It was released in the 1960s, a time when racial identity was a controversial topic. The book disproportionately investigates cultures from Africa, and the americas and asks how these ""primitive"" and ""savage"" races could have possibly developed advanced cultures and technologies. The book makes the illogical jump that these people must have had help from someone to develop their culture, in this case that external help is aliens. 

Even at the time the book was released it was thoroughly debunked by actual experts in the field. There were mysteries at the time that archaeology couldn't yet explain, and this was manipulated to further the book's narrative. One such example is Palenque's sarcophagus. At the time, Maya hieroglyphics were not understood and were incomprehensible to archaeologists and linguists. Von D√§niken suggested in his book that the sarcophagus lid depicted an individual operating a rocket ship. Archaeologists said that the imagery was consistent with Maya religious ideas about death. When the Mayan language was deciphered and the hieroglyphics on the sarcophagi were translated it supported the idea that the image depicted Palenque descending into the Maya underworld. This, however, was incompatible with the ancient aliens narrative. Rather than accept this new information they ignored it since it was incompatible with their idea that a ""primitive"" and ""savage"" race could have developed advanced astronomy, language, and culture. Almost every piece of so called evidence by ancient aliens proponents is just as easily dismissed when the full scope of the evidence is examined. 

In the foundational works of the ancient aliens hypothesis non-white cultures form the basis of their evidence. Africans couldn't build pyramids without alien help but the romans had no problem building the coliseum. In one of his books Von D√§niken even suggests that Africans were a failed genetic experiment that was corrected in the European and Asian races. It is important to mention that I do not believe that all the people who believe in ancient aliens are racist, but it is undeniable that the origins of the idea are deeply rooted in racism.

Foods high in sulfur contain something called MSM that reduces joints inflammation, and helps in rebuilding the tissue- High Sulfur Foods: Onions, Garlic, Asparagus, Cabbage

Bone Broth is high in collagen that contain the Amino Acids Proline and Glycine which help rebuild tissue. Get this in your diet if you can. I use it everyday in a powder form that I add to my Kale/Fruit Smoothies. 
Last but not least, more raw fruits and vegetable. They should make up the bulk of your diet. Powerful anti cancer and anti inflammatory compounds. Apples, Kale, Bananas, Broccoli Sprouts, Carrots, Blueberry, CHERRIES (anti inflammatory) Pineapple, Mango, Goji Berry, are a few I use everyday. 

Avoid: Sugar, Hydrogenated Oils, Gluten. These will cause joint inflammation and should be avoided at all costs. 

Supplement: 
-High Quality Fish Oil
-Turmeric- amazing super food and super anti-inflammatory 
-Proteolytic Enzymes- such as Bromelain, found in pineapple, can be supplemented and very effective in reducing joint inflammation. 
-Glucosamine 
-MSM: type of sulfur found in supplement forms. 

These are things you can try that might help with your arthritis along with whatever your doctor is telling you to do.

As for baggy eyes, often remedied by drinking a lot of water since you become bloated from stored water when you're not properly hydrated. Under the eyes is a place that becomes visible. Remember the skin under the eye is thinner than other parts of the face so it's not that uncommon to see discolored or baggy eyes. As always for many other health reasons, sleep 8-9 hrs every night. I recommend getting in bed around 9 or earlier if possible. Sleep that happens before midnight has the most rejuvenating and healing effects.

For instance, if the guide told me to add [[Searing Blood]] versus 5-Color Humans for a Burn deck and then went on to explain that [[Searing Blood]] is added because 5-Color Humans is a creature-based deck that looks to aggressively deal damage using creatures therefore creature removal is a priority in the matchup. I see people tell what cards to change but don't give explanation which can be frustrating to people new to the game or to a particular format. If there is not an explanation, then you are just blindly following the card choices without knowing immediately the reasons behind the choices. It is my theory that when people do not give explanations, this could point to them not really being confident about their sideboard picks. 	magicTCG	magicTCG	-1

1610	"A couple issues I see with the questions you want answered:

1. You are searching for a counter macro prediction, based in micro. There are not that many macro predictions with a pure microfoundation. I believe this is currently something that is being worked on by ABM efforts though. Micro can have good predictions on microbehavior, but you are also dealing with small groups which exhibit a lot of variation group to group. So the comparison that was made is not a very good one when macro gets to study large groups and can more heavily lean on the law of large numbers to mute effects of small group to group variations.
2. The prediction example in the article is pretty weak. I would like to point out that inflation is highly mechanism dependent and inflation will not always show up in CPI-U. If the monetary base grew because of direct fiscal stimulus measures (think direct lending, helicopter money, guaranteed jobs, UBI, whatever) instead of trickle down monetary approaches (no guarantee the extra money gets lent into the consumer economy), then you would probably see much different results. IS-LM is much too simplistic to consider such non-ad hoc predictions like a full framework would.

If you insist on a better micro based example, Deep Learning macroeconomic models are probably the most accurate framework we have right now (IS-LM isn't really a framework). Deep Learning is already more accurate/reliable than the DSGE framework, and Deep Learning self-trains high complexity models from micro and macro foundational data."	"Do you though?

1617	"Also, anxiety is largely caused - if I understand right - by our fight of flight instinct being triggered. And the anxieties of modern life are worse than what our ancestors dealt with, because you can neither fight nor flee from the rent, or bills, or your job.


In video games tho, if the anxiety becomes bad, you can turn it off. You can buckle down and try harder if you prefer - the ""fight"" response - or turn it off and never touch it again, which would be the ultimate ""flight"" response (our forager ancestors could not see a lion coming toward them and simply flip a switch to exit the situation!).


I have dealt with anxiety on and off, and I have found that while games help, sometimes they don't. An example is when I played World of Warcraft. Once my guy got high level and I was raiding with a big guild, there was suddenly a raid schedule. And I had a role I was expected to fill, with pressure to perform that job well. And there were penalties for not showing up! It took a few weeks of that to dump the game. But a few years later I had a friend who played, and she got me to play again. Just us, as a duo.

I think perhaps American cities/states are more well known, maybe because of all the media they produce, or maybe they're not but Americans just think they are? Either way, that could be a big factor. Although, it's true I don't identify with my province nearly as much as I do my country. 

Even though traveling to Quebec is way more of a culture shift than traveling to the states, Canada still feels like one unit, to me."	"They are though. Not that they are literally trying to quantify the opportunity cost of ""x"" years spent in jail vs the financial benefits of the act. Obviously these ass hats aren't doing something like that.

But the mind is constantly doing cost-benefit.

Our whole system is designed around altering that cost-benefit. Increasing probabilities of being caught, increasing the penalties once you are caught. Subconsciously you are determining an expected value of an action or inaction. If you are going to rob a store for $1000 dollars and there is no cop within 10 km, that is one thing. That changes when there is $100,000 but there is a cop around the corner. That changes whether the punishment for getting caught is 30 days or 5 years.

If punishments didn't deter crimes our entire system of governance wouldn't work as well as it does. Obviously the weighting and probabilities are always getting tweaked to maximize the efficiency of our justice system. Police departments get bigger. Sentences get altered. Constantly trying to maximize the cost benefit from the perspective of the government. They don't want the crime rates to be incredibly high, but they don't want to be spending billions and billions of extra dollars on law enforcement."	canada	canada	-1
1638	"Thanks. Here's the abstract for people that don't want to click.

&gt;Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) remains one of the most important unknowns in climate change science. ECS is defined as the global mean warming that would occur if the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration were instantly doubled and the climate were then brought to equilibrium with that new level of CO2. Despite its rather idealized definition, ECS has continuing relevance for international climate change agreements, which are often framed in terms of stabilization of global warming relative to the pre-industrial climate. However, the ‚Äòlikely‚Äô range of ECS as stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has remained at 1.5‚Äì4.5 degrees Celsius for more than 25 years1. The possibility of a value of ECS towards the upper end of this range reduces the feasibility of avoiding 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, as required by the Paris Agreement. Here we present a new emergent constraint on ECS that yields a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits (equivalent to the IPCC ‚Äòlikely‚Äô range) of 2.2‚Äì3.4 degrees Celsius. Our approach is to focus on the variability of temperature about long-term historical warming, rather than on the warming trend itself. We use an ensemble of climate models to define an emergent relationship2 between ECS and a theoretically informed metric of global temperature variability. This metric of variability can also be calculated from observational records of global warming3, which enables tighter constraints to be placed on ECS, reducing the probability of ECS being less than 1.5 degrees Celsius to less than 3 per cent, and the probability of ECS exceeding 4.5 degrees Celsius to less than 1 per cent."

1649	"An outsiders perspective:
From what I know and understand of the CPF system, I can say that it is better than Australias. Sure your take home is less but its honestly for your own greater good.
You are forced to save, ok so say you're 15? (i'm not sure what the youngest legal working age is in Singapore), and you start work, from day 1, you are saving towards your future and a house. This is a HUGE thing.

Once you finally have a house, if you use what is in your CPF housing find for the deposit, the contributions to the fund from both you and your employeer will mostly cover the cost of the loan. You might see this as a small thing, but this is huge, think about it. You have a huge asset under you, which is costing you very little more to pay off. In the mandatory 5 years it takes before you can sell it, if it was purchased off the plan, you're likely now making more money and if you want, can probably now afford a bigger place.

In Australia we get superannuation, we can't touch it at all till we are 65+ AND retired. This is a retirement fund ONLY. It is around 10% of our before tax salary, on top of our already much higher tax rate. Most companies will give you a ""package pay rate"", so for example say your pay on paper was 85,000, your taxed income is now 76,500, at this wage, tax is around 26%, leaving you with a yearly take home of 56,610. If you're living by yourself or in one of the capital cities, you can then expect your rent and bills alone to be around $2500 a month, leaving you with an actual $26,610 a year for food, entertainment, personal loans, other expenses, savings ect.

I think your CPF contributions are a small price to pay for the huge benefit you get from it and I feel that the system is very much in your interest.

Turns out AT&amp;T did not even have a TV + Internet package at the promised price.  I cancelled.  They tried to charge me for the free installation I was promised for the service that was not as advertised and only halfway installed.

It only took me 4 phone calls to clear this up, but I knew I'd have problems, so I wrote down everyone's name including the original sales guy, including all three ""managers"" that had said they would take care of the charge for me.

I was told that it was under investigation and that they had pulled the recorded call. "	"&gt; Just because they don't make machines you want, doesn't mean the machines they do make are overpriced. 

It's absolutely overpriced.

I'm looking at the [iMac Pro Prices](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/imac-pro/3.2ghz-1tb#) and while the specs are really high, it doesn't justify the high prices if you only care about performance and not the actual part used. 

A good example in that link prices link is that you have to select a Xeon W rather than in intel i7 or i9, and it looks specifically like they use the [Xeon W-2145](https://ark.intel.com/products/series/125035/Intel-Xeon-W-Processor) (or an earlier generation of it at 3.2Gzh rather than 3.7 Ghz) at a minimum proc which is ~$1100. Now Xeon is a server processor so you could argue that that is simply a *different kind of product* than a typical desktop, but the fact is the they are selling desktop PCs and that just doesn't make sense to me you can *only* configure them to use server processors. Xeons are more stable and have better thermal performance but these benefits are generally negligible for most users. When it comes to performance computing power, it's just an excuse to raise the price way higher than necessary. [Here's some creative users that appear to agree with me](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=1420169). On top of that the fact you can't configure to use the latest components so already by going with apple you're using 1+ generations of outdated hardware.

Another example is that the monitor is 27"" 5K display when 4K displays are the standard. [Searching for a 27"" 5K monitors on amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_3?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=5k+monitor&amp;sprefix=5k+%2Caps%2C144&amp;crid=52GPFJE5EWB8) shows that 4K monitors are usually &lt; $500 while barely any 5K monitors popup and the one that does is $1500. So to me it's another example of Apple going against the grain to use nonconventional parts to justify higher costs for marginal benefit.

Assuming I stick with all the minimum requirements and the price is still $5K for an iMac Pro, You could make a desktop with a 4K monitor for &lt; $2500, and probably it would have even better performance. Below is an example I might make to replicate performance of the iMac Pro with a desktop: I'm using a 9700k which is [ranked 7th in all CPU's by performance](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/) for $420, and has 8 @ 3.6Ghz cores like the minimum in the iMac Pro build @ 3.2Ghz. If 5K monitors were reasonably priced then it I'd still have $300 of room to upgrade from a $4K monitor.

Last weekend I was performing improv theatre at a community event. It's usually a fun time where you can be silly and step outside yourself.

One of the games we played was ""arms experts"" where we get two players and two audience members onstage, and the audience members stand behind the players and use their own arms in place of the characters. My audience member was 20 years my senior, and female.

What happened next surprised me. While I was introducing myself, the audience member while standing behind me, reached down and grabbed my genitals open handed and squeezed. I was mortified... but even moreso when the audience just laughed. I didn't want to break down the fourth wall and so I stayed in character, until the scene was over. I probably tried to brush it off but now, a few days later, see how much I was violated.

So my question is, why would the audience just stand there and laugh? People knew that the scene was not scripted.

So now I wonder, Should I have made a scene and ask that the audience member leave? Do I press charges and make an example of the situation? Do I just laugh about it and move on? I'm a bit conflicted at the moment."	MensRights	MensRights	-1

Talking with a parent about something related to a Jin Yong novel was something of a rite of passage for me.  However, I wish those comparasions to Tolkien would stop.  Tolkien never had to serialize his books in newspapers.  Jin Yong did, and had to manage at least a few competent 'Fuck Yes' moments every dozen paragraphs.  He wrote something for everyone.  His stories had interesting allegories to China and Hong Kong, past and present.  There was plenty of action, romance, politics, social commentary, and could be enjoyed at middle school reading levels.  He had every intention of being a mass market story teller and succeeded in that regard more so than any other Hong Kong author.

Jin Yong as the Tolkien of Chinese Fantasy is a lazy comparison.  Jin Yong was our Shakespeare.

That friend ended up having to drop out of college because of the break downs. She's a lot better now.

I'm an only child so my parents were constantly paying attention to me. I had chores, but my mom never punished me when I didn't do them and would just do them herself. When I got older and started doing adult tasks like waxing my car, he would always take over because I wasn't ""Doing it right"". When cooking meals, my parents would always take over without me asking. I made it through grad school just fine, but I get extremely stressed out when I have to make decisions, horrible at cooking, I procrastinate things I have to do in fear of doing it wrong, and have full on anxiety when I get critiqued.

Here is a very common problem. I loved Breath of the Wild as most did, but some of the cutscenes drove me nuts with the pacing of dialogue. When someone says something important emotionally, there needs to be a pause sometimes, the words and emotion need to hang in the air and be felt. But instead the dialogue is delivered line after line very quickly like the voice actor did it all at once and was in a hurry. There is a very sisterly scene between two characters in BOTW, and instead of thinking and feeling each lines meaning, one character just looks done while the other sleeps on there lap, and belts out lines quickly. 

That‚Äôs what is so great about The Last of Us, not only did they have excellent dialogue, delivered well, it‚Äôs paced, and directed well.

1725	"I was waiting for this paradoxical argument. This is akin to saying that killing animals in order to save animals is the answer to people killing animals. You don't stop the killing of animals by killing more animals so you can pay for more captive breeding of animals to kill. This is such a BS argument. Of course numbers go up, they are being protected so more can be killed. The inevitable conclusion is that you need an ever-increasing supply of animals to kill but eventually the house of cards will collapse. 

The problem is the idea of trophy hunting and poaching. Both are exactly the same level of indefensible. Being legal doesn't mean it's good. You are getting the word conservation and captive breeding for the sake of slaughter confused. This literally was born of the same logic that most NRA arguments are.

1727	What kind of school teaches about Noah!? Assuming you are in the United States, it's illegal for public schools to teach the Bible as anything other than literature, and since your grandparents are Holocaust survivors, I suspect you're Jewish and probably not attending a Christian private school. Is this a Jewish private school? If it's a public school, please [contact the FFRF](https://ffrf.org/legal/report/) to encourage your school to follow the law (and the FFRF will keep your complaint anonymous, so you don't need to fear repercussions from the school).	"I'm a christian.  I believe God does exist and that there are good reasons for it.  I also agree with you (with an upcoming caveat).

You and I agree that 

&gt; the burden should be placed on the one making the claim (there is a God), not for someone else to prove the claim is wrong. I can‚Äôt prove there are no invisible flying fairies but that does not then mean there are fairies.  

And that it is not fair for someone to justify their lack of belief that God exists.

Here are the couple of places I think we may disagree:

1. Many Theists, (including myself) can be rude or dismissive and we need to work on that.  However, I suspect that in some percentage of questions as to ""why you do not believe.""  Were simply aimed at ascertaining more information, where are you coming from as it were.  Are you super familiar with the arguments, are you a newcomer, do you care about reason or emotion more?  I think that's fair for either party to ask each other so that we know where to start.  However, you're probably right.  Some theists were probably just being lazy and trying to get you to justify something you didn't need too.  If they do present a good argument though you should be open to engaging with it, and if you find it convincing be willing to re-evaluate your beliefs.
2. I don't think I've ever heard an apologist for any religion resort to ""you just have to pick the religion/belief that you believe is correct.""  Christian and Islamic apologists tend to start by arguing for the existence of a generic God.  Once someone is convinced of a generic God, much of the specific evidence for a religion (historical impact, miracles, personal life impact) becomes much more plausible.  If you find the existence of God highly unlikely you will be highly (and rightly) very heavily biased against something like evidence for a persons supernatural Resurrection from the dead, no matter how compelling.  Additionally, the main religions that postulate this type of God are Islam, Christianity and Judaism, religions like hinduism, bhudism, new age, janism, taoism etc. are radically different and recieve no support from arguments for geneneric theism or deism.  But, ya, if someone is making a fallacious argument from consensus they're wrong
3. If someone simply does not believe there is a God that does not require support.  That is simple withholding belief.  However, if someone makes the claim that there is no God, or that they know there is no God, or that they are 85% certain there is no God, they have just made a positive claim themselves that needs support to be accepted.  They could maybe justify some confidence in said belief with Occam's razor (having fewer moving parts in ones metaphysic is preferable to more), but that isn't super compelling.  You can be agnostic, unsure about whether there is a God or not without needing to support that view (not believing in a God).  However, if you are an atheist (here defined as holding the belief there is no God) you need some support for that positive claim the same as the theist."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

This is simply MY opinion.  You will have to research and decide for yourself if I am a fool or not.

1741	"Slaughtered meat is bled out before the carcass is processed. Settled blood plays a role in expedited decay so having blood in your meat is a no no. If you‚Äôve ever seen a so-called ‚Äúbloody‚Äô steak, it‚Äôs unlikely it had any blood at all. The red or pink fluid in meat is more likely just albumin from the interstitial cavities between cells or from inside ruptured cells. Albumin by the way is the same stuff as in egg white. If you‚Äôve ever cooked meat too fast you can actually get the albumin to cook before the meat where you‚Äôll get a grainy white leakage coming out of the meat. Poorly or over cooked salmon is very well known for this. 

For the main part of your question: Almost all meat you‚Äôve ever eaten from a store or restaurant is well past rigor. Rigor sets in 2-4 hours after slaughter. After a few days rigor begins to resolve. As no meat producer would want a customer to eat meat in rigor and no meat producer is going to get meat on your plate before rigor, the meat you eat is almost certainly not just days past rigor, but 2-4 weeks past the onset of rigor."	You can do an experiment to how much effort it would be to lift a weight from the ground using the different forces. If you use the strong nuclear force it would be hard to get a small enough experiment that can not lift the weight. Considering that even a few protons is able to hang together through nuclear bombs a small weight would not cause them to yield. The weak nuclear force is much weaker but it can still hold up your weight using just a few strands of carbon fiber. The electromagnetic force is again much weaker and instead of a few strands of carbon fiber you would need at least a 9V battery to lift a ton of weight. But when you consider that what was holding down the weight in the first place were the entire Earth using the gravitational force it is quite easy to see how weak it is. As to why these forces are the strength they are we do not know. We can only experience these forces and measure them but we can only speculate as to why the physical laws are what they are.

But that it's entirely possible that there exist places/dimensions/whatever where space and time as we conceptualize them don't exist, or exist in a different way.

And for me, my notion of 'god' lies both in the reality of our universe (that we are all one, that we arose from the earth/universe and continue to be a part of it even in death/decomposition) and in the mystery beyond our universe (who the fuck knows what that is). 

So even though I'm not traditionally 'religious', I do feel spiritual, and feel that 'god' is a concept that transcends the physics of our particular universe and understanding. So would agree in some ways that god exists outside of space/time. "	"Believer here. The Bible is mythology. It is rich mythology imbued with powerful archetypes that lose their power if taken literally. The inevitability of resurrection that we see in life cycles is presaged in our mythology and it invites us to view all of the resurrections we see as sacred. When we fall through sudden realization off good and evil, we never get that innocence back; we can't unlearn. We fail and then are reclaimed somehow -- compare David's Oracle with the last verse of Cohen's Hallelujah.

It's more than metaphor. It's myth, it's archetype, it's deep deep powerful stuff, and it's Holy. I don't need for any of it to have actually happened. It's all happening, all the time, it's all true, a truth that has nothing to do with fact."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

1767	"I feel the disagreement will hit a head here so bear with me. God is perfect. Satan is imperfect (but was created perfect). God created everything. 

So here is the full head of disagreement will probably hit. God created Lucifer in perfect nature with a choice that he could make to be prideful enough to think that he could be God.

Look at his account in Ezekiel 28:11-15 which is the perfect being Lucifer:

11 The word of the Lord came to me: 12 ‚ÄúSon of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: ‚ÄòThis is what the Sovereign Lord says:

‚Äú‚ÄòYou were the seal of perfection,
    full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
13 You were in Eden,
    the garden of God;
every precious stone adorned you:
    carnelian, chrysolite and emerald,
    topaz, onyx and jasper,
    lapis lazuli, turquoise and beryl.[b]
Your settings and mountings[c] were made of gold;
    on the day you were created they were prepared.
14 You were anointed as a guardian cherub,
    for so I ordained you.
You were on the holy mount of God;
    you walked among the fiery stones.
15 You were blameless in your ways
    from the day you were created
    till wickedness was found in you.

Lucifer was perfect and was there in Eden which means he was perfect in the Garden. Then somewhere in there, he sinned.

Look at verses 16 through 19.

16 Through your widespread trade
    you were filled with violence,
    and you sinned.
So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God,
    and I expelled you, guardian cherub,
    from among the fiery stones.
17 Your heart became proud
    on account of your beauty,
and you corrupted your wisdom
    because of your splendor.
So I threw you to the earth;
    I made a spectacle of you before kings.
18 By your many sins and dishonest trade
    you have desecrated your sanctuaries.
So I made a fire come out from you,
    and it consumed you,
and I reduced you to ashes on the ground
    in the sight of all who were watching.
19 All the nations who knew you
    are appalled at you;
you have come to a horrible end
    and will be no more.‚Äô‚Äù

Look, God knew that Lucifer would make the choice to sin so in my opinion, God created a perfect place that is earth with the most amazing creation that was man. Lucifer sinned with his pride and was thrown down and it started a wave of events that would be to rectify the sin that was made in heaven by Lucifer by Jesus Christ.

You can see that after Christ was resurrected, Jesus tells Mary Magdalene this:

Jesus said, ""Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' ‚Äú
John 20:17

He was in a perfect resurrected body and needed to ascend and place His blood on the heavenly tabernacle to rectify the heavenly sin that was committed. 

So TL:DR our battle is not what we think it is:

For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. - Ephesians 6:12

This is a battle of dark forces against the power of light. We are stuck in the middle of it and Christ is the only one that can rectify our souls from the fallen state.

Then there's also the fact that he wrote a hundred thousand (I think) words for TWOIAF around 2013-2014. We have no idea how many times he wrote, deleted, and rewrote those hundred thousand words if he didn't nail it on the first try.

That leaves out time he spends working on other projects, most notably Wild Cards which has become a meme. I believe he edits all of them, which involves  reading every single one and making sure there are no timeline problems and stuff like that... and more. He wrote an entire blog post defending his work for Wild Cards while also kind of playing the victim by saying how involved he is in it and just how much he does for that series. There are three more Wild Cards books yet to be published.

We also don't know how many days he takes to do other stuff, or nothing. We don't know the amount of days spent in his underwear on the couch, eating soft shell tacos off of his bare chest while waiting for the muse to strike.


So, it's probably true that as he gets older each book takes a little longer to write, but it hasn't been seven years of actual writing. I don't believe the release of the book is imminent like people here have been claiming since 2014.

"I see many of great advises here but I am sort of a newbie with RDAs - only couple of months into it - so maybe you could use my revelations and tips too:

1.)    Easy to start ‚Äì it is soo easy to have it up and running. Before switching to RDA I had one RTA (Ammit) and the whole wicking process was more finicky there. One slightly thinner wick and juice all over the place. Too much wick, dry hits coming. Until you get the hand of it.. With RDAs, there are so less room for an error if you are beginner.

2.)    Coils ‚Äì yeah, it is way cheaper than non RBAs but also the opportunities for exploration are really huge. I tried various types of coils and wire which provided me total different vape experience. And that pure feeling of joy and excitement  is something that also gives me an additional boost with the overall vaping experience. Cos if you want, you can have something totally different whenever you want. OK, now I know what I like (Ni80, fused claptons and framed staple) and don‚Äôt (SS &amp; Aliens in general) so I usually stick with it. But the feeling that I am not limited to anything makes this more overwhelming experience overall. Later, when u find out what you like and if you don‚Äôt want to build coils by yourself, I will advise to go with more quality and handmade coils. When I started I bought loads of deamon kiler, coilology coils so I can play and test all of them. They are really nice thing to start with but usually don‚Äôt last a lot. Now I buy some local handmade coils where the pair of coils is priced almost more than the whole package of branded ones but the overall flavor and longevity I get from them simply cannot be compared with Chinese coils.

3.)    Play with your builds ‚Äì just play and experiment. Before I started I couldn‚Äôt believe that even a slightest difference I coil placement can make a difference. But that is so true. Don‚Äôt be afraid to redo your build if you are not satisfied. I spent soo much cotton and juice on my Drop RDA until I found a perfect placement for my style of vape. It took some time but now I am enjoying every single puff I take.

4.)    Maintenance ‚Äì take care of your coils and clean them often. Usually I rewick every two days and also clean my coils during the process. Also, at least once per week I fully clean my RDA. Sometimes also more often, in case I am switching to a new flavor.. Maybe it‚Äôs too much, but I like to keep it clean and tidy :)

1799	"&gt; Because it could threaten him. Diversity metrics could result in him getting passed up for a job, promotion, etc. It's pretty obvious.

Its sounds paranoid. The assumption that aiming for a diverse workforce means less for another seems like a pretty giant leap to make.

Especially when it pertains to software development, where our hiring processes and even our ability to measure a programmers performance kinda really sucks. The idea that a GOOD programmer will be overlooked, to the benefit of a Mediocre one. Doesn't have any basis in reality, because we don't have a good way of keeping good metrics.

&gt; Take something patently obvious, like the front line of a NFL team. Sex based preferences, on average, may lead to less women desiring to play football.

Testosterone does not make a person any more capable or willing to be software developers. So comparing it the NFL seems really disingenuous here. We can measure physical feats, and can objective measure the physical abilities of 1 person over another is REALLY easy with sports. Not the same with software dev, not even close. 

Whats so special about Software Development that makes you think  they are less capable? Ok maybe your aren't saying they are less capable, although thats what it sounds like when people constantly bring up biology as some kind of factor. Even though there seems to be NO scientific evidence to back up the claim. The claim gets repeated.

I'm not trying to draw a comparison who has it worse, modern woman or the woman's suffrage movement. I'm drawing a comparison to the rhetoric. The Biology argument that women can't to the job of a man, or isn't good enough, or isn't as capable, or is simply disinterested. 

&gt; Show me the hordes of women who want jobs programming but are denied because of their sex? The situation is apples and oranges.

I can't show hordes of women who are denied for jobs, because when I speak with women about this. They point to the hordes of men who make arguments like yours, essentially telling them to NOT bother trying. Hell some might even come to believe what your selling. All I have is anecdotal evidence, and stories and a genuine interest in seeing people pursue a career in software development.

I can't for the LIFE of me explain all this gate keeping thats going around? I can't explain why a diverse workplace is a negative thing, and why the word diverse has become a bad word. Especially in programming where we can't measure performance like we can other professions, or feats. Hell programming isn't even ALL mental, and ACTUALLY has very little complex Math, if any.There is an emotional intelligence component to it as well as you need to be able to work well with others, and know how to communicate.

Yet even you fail to give me an adequate reason for all this defensiveness. Helping out someone else who isn't a white male, doesn't make you less. Encouraging other people to pursue a job in this career doesn't mean less for you. And making a workforce diverse isn't a bad thing, why is the assumption automagically someone took my job, and they deserve it less? Last time I checked there were more jobs that people to fill them. And all I've ever seen is Diversity be pushed to help encourage more engagement and participation in a field.

i remain unconvinced, and continually dishearten by the conversation and the extreme reaction to trying to allow our career be more accessible. We aren't special, and what we do isn't hard or require a penis."

1805	"1.) This is tough to say because generally speaking measuring and comparing one animal's intelligence to another's is REALLY challenging. There's a really good book on this subject and if you're interested in animal intelligence, I would suggest reading it, it's called ""Are We Smart Enough To Know How Smart Animals Are"". I recommend it.  As far as social intelligence, that's also hard to compare. Which cephalopod is best an interacting with humans to get more food or attention out of us? Probably octopus. Which is best at forming social groups for hunting? probably the schooling squid (e.g. humboldt squid). Intelligence all depends on the context of the type of life the animal is leading. If it's really important to build a den and stay hidden, the octopus is the ""smartest"" at decorating its den, changing color and texture, and staying out of harms way.  If it's important to communicate with your peers using flashing color displays and working together, maybe the humboldt squid is smarter.  If it's important to be able to cross-dress and pretend to be a female to get to mate with a female, then the giant australian cuttlefish is the smartest. If it's important to communicate verbally, a dolphin has them all beat. 


2.) A lot of squid have very short life spans. When you're the prey item on the menu for a lot of animals you need to be really effective at breeding fast and making a lot offspring.

1807	I'm just worried about the fact that scourge is currently on the bottom of DPS charts without Epidemic, yet on top with epidemic (ele is still better due to that overtuned ferocity trait...). So if you make it better by increasing its DPS without Epidemic, you once again make Epi trivialize certain mechanics.	"Ok, but whether you have 20 skills bars or 1 with 20 hidden, as long as you can only channel skills one after the other (which is the case), you have the same number of skills. And swapping bars is actually another button press. I would call the 20 hotbars ""organ"" and the hidden ones ""piano"" as it's more linear.

Anywho, when it comes down to button pressing, if you decompose the rotations over time and not purely the number of buttons, since the point is to use all of the available bar, then engi and ele are inherently more ""piano-like"" because switching attunements requires much more management than just swapping weapons every 8 to 9 seconds, while also switching in the right one.

Condi warrior is clearly not as piano as staff weaver since it relies on mashing all you buttons with one logic process in mind to achieve top DPS. Weaver however cannot be put at the same level. The ""piano"" part is not only button presses, it's also the flow of the rotato and how you put your mind to it. Like a piano piece. Warrior is some Bach prelude while weaver is some Chopin waltz."

Next to zero.

Dotty's been in development for many years now; it may land in 2019, but could just as well be 2020. Union types, the new enum syntax, implicit function types, etc., along with general language cleanup will be nice for sure, but it will still be Scala. Which is to say, the compiler will not be fast (expected 2X speedup is gone, will probably build as fast as present day Scala); SBT is still the primary build tool; new macros are very much a WIP, and TASTY, not sure if or when that will pan out.

Basically there's a ton or work left to do, and whether or not the end result is a massive improvement over the to-be-sunsetted Scala compiler is still very much TBD. Saying that, hopefully Dotty will come sooner than later, looks like, on paper, it will be a massive improvement."	"Agree... but:

Actually the situation is much worse.
Think a minute about how computers are used these days: Most of them are single-user, most (private data) living in user space. These days I would argue that kind of data is usually *way* more important to protect than the operating system around it.

Think about:

* SSH private key
* pass/keypass/whatever keystore database
* Browser password autocomplete data storage
* Credentials somewhere in your code project folders for deployment/testing/whatever
* Cryptocurrency stuff I assume? (no idea about that tbh)

All of this can (for most common system configurations) be uploaded to an attackers web space just by executing arbitrary code in *user space* (or deleted for that matter).

Thats not to say your point is not valid, of course there can be even more damage done as root, but keeping everything in user space these days just cuts of a fraction of attack vectors.

That's all I was looking for. Because you said the magic word ""Obviously."" Of course it's obvious to be Boy #2 instead of Boy #1. 

But if it were *totally* obviously the better option, your brain would be choosing it already. This means that part of you *doesn't* fully believe that the #2 choice is the obvious superior option. You'd agree? 

The part of you that doesn't want to change is your lower brain. It's what keeps you playing video games, staying inside, not going to class, and fapping. It's what makes you feel like you'll explode on Day 3 of NoFap. 

But your higher brain is the one that's all aboard for improving. Your higher brain is unsure if it can convince the lower brain to ""commit itself or take responsibililty."" So what you need to do is give your higher brain a reason to keep trying. To keep trying. To keep trying. And trying. And trying.

Failure is essential to growth in everything we do. **Growth and comfort rarely ride in on the same horse.**

So do you want this *bad enough* (specific improvement) to be willing to keep trying in the face of failure, even if you fail several times? This is no gentle question. The brain (lower or higher) that makes you answer this question is the one you need to support.

Anything from the bi-weekly specials catalogs to the semiannual phone book-sized catalogs and Christmas Wishbook. Our city hits -40¬∞C in winter, and on catalog weekends, you'd be trudging out in the snow and ice for up to 12 hours a day on foot, getting piles of catalogs dropped off at street corners by the principal in the schoolbus. As one of the more competent deliverers, I would be given stacks of delivery slips (often with incorrect or nonexistent addresses) and a small team of kids, often newbies who'd never done deliveries before. Most kids could only carry a bundle of catalogs at a time (8 to 16 per bundle), so I would have to plan routes and hand out assignments on the fly, often in neighbourhoods I'd never been in before, with a hard-to-read photocopied map if I was lucky, keeping track of everyone and running from street to street to leave bundles where everyone would need them, while doing more than my own portion of deliveries at the same time. 

And then there were some moments best described as forlorn, when you'd just get dropped off on some rural road by yourself with too many catalogs to carry, no idea of where to go, and instructions to be done in three hours.

1910	I am not convinced that free will exists, so a more appropriate question for me would be how do you tell if something is conscious. This is currently being studied, and we don't know a lot about it.	"Hi OP, thanks for the insightful post. You did a lot of collecting of good Bible verses to make the point. 

Essentially, your argument is a reductio ad absurdem taking the form: ""If X, then Y. Not Y. Therefore not X.""

1. If the world is full of magic (as the world seems to be described in the Bible), then there will be verifiable, creditable magic to be present in history and in modern times. 
2. But there isn't verifiable creditable magic in history and modern times. 
3. Therefore, the world is not how it is described by the Bible --  a world full of magic. 

I think you well supported the first premise. And the conclusion follows from the two premises. 

The place to look is your second premise. The second premise you simply stated. You said that history and modern times are not replete with miracles (except ones that are ""discredited""). 

If I challenged the second premise, asserting that anyone who cares to investigate miracle claims (from Christians or any other group) will discover that the observable world is indeed full of them, what would you say? 

I'd venture that some people (and just wait for the comments!) will mock me. But let's ignore them. 

- Some people will say that many miracle claims have been discredited. That's true! But many historical claims have been discredited, and that doesn't discredit all of history, only those claims. Many historical claims, and many miracle claims, have been credited and verified. 

- Some people will say ""Where's the evidence? Prove it to me."" To that I say, four things: first, I'd say beware of sealioning. It's not my job to prove to flat-earthers that the earth is round. It's not my job to prove to materialists that reality is material and formal. If you don't know how things stand, or who to trust, that's on you. But if the question is sincere, perhaps start with Craig Keener's book, *Miracles* (https://www.amazon.com/Miracles-Credibility-New-Testament-Accounts/dp/0801039525) Thirdly, ""proof"" is completed when the proof has been given. Persuasion is not the same as proof. I can prove things to my five year old son that will not *persuade* him because he is being unreasonable. So you have to persuade yourself; the proof is out there.  

Fourthly, and relatedly, the problem with doubting a thing's existence is that doubt disincentivizes the search for evidence. If I don't believe in sea creatures, I am not likely to go swimming in the ocean looking to ""prove"" to myself that the ocean is indeed empty. 

All that to say, the evidence and proof are plain to most people and readily available unless you are (a) already so sure that you're right that you only mock and dismiss those who could potentially offer you evidence and (b) don't go out of the way to seek the uncomfortable truth about our world. 

I believe in science, have a Ph.D., and have personally experienced miracles and know people who perform miracles with some regularity. So, despite skepticism of some particular claims, I credit many of the Biblical stories, historical stories, and modern stories. I don't think that I am weird in this way. Disbelief in the supernatural is a minority report, globally. Most scientifically educated Americans believe in the supernatural. About 50 percent of working scientists are religious and believe in a god or higher power (footnote: http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/)

So there is nothing particularly wild or mysterious about the phenomena you describe as ""magic."" I've seen it personally, and hundreds of people I know have experienced it personally. So, when I consider the evidence impartially (including verifiable eye-witness accounts), I'd say your second premise needs revisiting.

But like I said, I appreciated the post, and enjoy thinking these things through. 

I'd appreciate *non-mocking* thoughtful responses as well. 

Cheers!

So I stopped using it altogether because its effect on me was so emotionally draining.

The apparent effect of quitting wasn't huge. I didn't lose touch with anyone who I was already good friends with.

1919	How about Naked 100? I have a bottle of that as well, which I believe is 70/30. Should I be on the lookout for 50/50 juices?	"Yup, always make sure the coils aren't touching anything and the leads aren't touching the other coil if you are building on a dual coil RDA. 

Another tip is to buy an ultrasonic cleaner to clean your coils once you've wrapped them so you don't vape the oil, sweat and the other crap from your hands that gets on them. That is of course only necessary if you don't use powder-free gloves when building.

For cleaning gunked up coils people say to glow the coils and then run them under water, but I don't like the idea of getting all the crap in tap water on my coils so I personally pulse the coil and then take a small brass welders brush and give it a nice scrubbing. Plus if you use SS they can rust, and sometimes with cheap kanthal as the contain iron.

Also stick to either kanthal, nichrome or SS for your metals as those require less care when building as nickel and titanium can produce harmful compounds if you heat them to high. Even with SS you need to be careful when dryburning as it can degrade the metal and mess it up chemically. There's a video out there that goes over the proper care and methods for cleaning SS coils, but I don't have a link. Personally I use nichrome as it gives good flavor and I have to worry less than with SS and I don't use TC. 

Also make sure you check the ohms on a regulated mod or an ohm reader of the coils after you have them wicked because it will change. It doesn't usually change much for simple round wire builds, but it does and its just kind of a step I've always done because I'm used to building for mechs. If you ever move to more complex builds like claptons or fused claptons it can change quite a bit because you'll have hotspots, little shorts between the outer wrappings, and that can change the ohm readings once you have the hotspots out and the coils glowing properly.

Whatever reddit provides or some youtube series like Maangchi, J. Townsend &amp; Sons, or that Primitive Technology guy.   Or... if I do watch television HGTV's House Hunters.  

I like them better because they don't have that psychological hook that I NEED to watch the next cliffhanger episode and I'm not as bombarded by commercials.

"I kind of went through this scam. I was an AT&amp;T customer and they offered me an amount off my bill for trying Direct TV Now free for a week. I think it was like $50. I figured what the hell, $50 bucks is $50 and maybe the service is ok. Anyway, I go through the sign up process with the AT&amp;T rep. Mind you, this was described as a FREE trial, no commitments. So I was a bit off out when he asked for a credit card, but figured it was when you forget to cancel. I figured I wouldn‚Äôt forget and if I did, the monthly bill was only like $30, so I‚Äôd end up +$20 regardless. I gave him my liquid because I usually do that for subscriptions(although sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work). I had money on it, enough to cover the first month for sure, but regardless it got declined. With liquid cards, if you don‚Äôt have the money in the account, it‚Äôll cancel the transaction. It‚Äôs a nice way to avoid overdrafts if you have a lot of subscriptions. I just figured they couldn‚Äôt get the repeating authorization, an issue I get when using liquid cards with Netflix, and gave them my real account. Imagine my surprise when I was charged almost $130 immediately from direct TV. I alerted the rep and he told me that no I didn‚Äôt. I told him I absolutely did get charged $127 and that is not cool. We go back and forth a bit, he has excuses(maybe it‚Äôs an authorization, maybe it‚Äôs a hold, etc). He told me he wouldn‚Äôt be able to reverse whatever he did because he wasn‚Äôt sure what happened, that I should call my bank and then call back. I told him I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in calling back and he had until the end of the day to figure it out and call me back, and I messaged my bank to alert them of the situation and confirm it was a charge. Waited for his call, never got it. I called AT&amp;T a few times trying to resolve it at the insistence of my bank, but you see, DirectTV has separate customer service than AT&amp;T. They can sign you up, offer you discounts on your AT&amp;T bill for signing up, but they can‚Äôt rectify any issues with that process. Long story short, it took forever to get the situation rectified through DirectTV and eventually this led me to leaving AT&amp;T as a customer because I was so frustrated with them.

1954	"Hi there, great question! I think it is important that we have these discussions about how we can ensure that admission to medical school is an equitable process for those from all social classes, ethnicities, and backgrounds. I am the first person from my family to attend University and growing up no one in my social circle was in medicine. Regardless, I still feel incredibly privileged to have been admitted to medical school and have had the opportunity to pursue the activities that helped me gain admission. Although I would say that from my experience, family income is not an insurmountable barrier to these opportunities! My family is incredibly supportive of the work I do but I personally wanted to self-fund my education. In Canada (and at UBC), I think this is entirely possible due to tuition becoming quite subsidized (compared to medical schools in other countries), student loans are very accessible, and most of the research I've done has been funded by the University or external research awards. UBC Medicine recently posted about their MCAT assistance program that will help lower the costs for students with financial hardship (http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2017/11/01/mcat-fee-assistance-program-for-canadians/)

Regarding your comment about residency placement - I would say from my knowledge, financial or family resources become even less of a consideration at this point. Life experience is not just about traveling the world and I would say facing hardship (whatever it is) gives you plenty of life experience :) Also, your amicability is entirely dependent on you and not what privilege you may have!

I'm not saying this is a perfect system, and undoubtedly it is unfortunate that some groups have a tougher time getting into medical school and succeeding in medicine. However, I do think the system makes an effort to level the playing field and it is entirely possible to build an awesome CV (and career) regardless of your background!

We got written up for a satellite cable attached to the house that wasn't painted the same color as the house. The black cable had been there for about 13 years before they decided to start writing us up for it. It was on the side of the house that wasn't visible from the street. Of course the house paint had faded, so the cable still stuck out even though it was the same color. 

Around the same time I was getting written up for parking my plain white cargo van in the driveway (was planning on weekend camper/vandweller/4x4 van build). It was my only personal vehicle, and 100% stock other than some roof bars for utility. No business advertisement, no ladders strapped to it. First letter was saying no commercial vehicles allowed in driveways. Once I told them that it was my personal vehicle, they said that it was too tall. I pointed out it was factory suspension, and said that others on the block had lifted vehicles taller than it. They asked me to narc on those other vehicles but I didn't reply back. They then said that it was the roof rack that made it too tall. I took it off, and they stopped pestering, as apparently the asshole that ran it for the 6 months this was going on pissed off enough people to get voted off the board. 

So yes, they have the authority to fine you for parking your personal vehicle in the driveway if they feel like it. Technically if I have friends/family stay overnight, I would have to call the HOA for approval to let them park on the street overnight.

But I can't because I don't even know. Maybe all I did was call her out for the lies and things that weren't adding up or maybe I thoroughly cussed her out or even insulted her. Maybe all of the above. 

Not knowing and only being able to guess while her silence makes me question everything, including whether or not I meant anything to her at all to be so thoroughly discarded, is maddening. So, too, is knowing that I was in bed and no more than a minute or two away from simply waking up the next day with a hangover. If I'd shut my phone off, if she'd texted me earlier in the evening, or **if I had never gotten drunk in the first place**. If only.

1999	Thank you for the correction. My background is molecular genetics, so I know I don't have all the terms right. I was very struck, though, at the applicability of molecular evolution concepts and techniques to linguistics.	"You might be thinking of the original ""light fighter"" concept of the F-16. In the 1970's-1980's, as fighter aircraft became heavier, more expensive, and more focused on technology such as bigger radars, bigger payloads, and longer range missiles (think F-14 and F-15, massive twin-engined fighters with big radars and carrying big missiles) . There was a cabal of aircraft designers and high ranking Air Force officers who believed to the contrary, that the optimal fighter is small, cheap, and light, able to close to short range and outmaneuver their larger components and effect a kill with guns or small heat seeking missiles. The original F-16 was essentially this idea, a cheap, highly maneuverable, single engine small fighter.

However as the F-16 aged, it has evolved (for a variety of reasons) from a light air superiority fighter designed to kill bigger, slower fighters, to what is essentially a multipurpose ""bomb truck"". 

They were super cheap so the Air Force has thousands of them, and when the Soviet Union collapsed and the US began fighting small geurilla forces across entire countries, the Air Force suddenly needed a lot fewer fighters and a lot more bombers. So they put bomb racks on them and now they fly over the Middle East and drop laser or GPS-guided JDAM's on people carrying AK-47's."	askscience	askscience	-1
2000	that makes sense. And i guess because God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are all considered divine entities on some level?	"&gt;Because they're required to arrive at the (lack of) afterlife you're arguing for.

I don't see it, you need to elaborate more on that idea. There is nothing you can observe after someone's death that can relate back to their personal thoughts and experiences, or any continuation of their previous life. This is what I'm referring to as an afterlife.

How are you defining afterlife here? 

I'm defining it as 
&gt;The afterlife is the belief that an essential part of an individual's identity or the stream of consciousness continues to manifest after the death of the physical body.

&gt;It'd be the subjective observation. AKA the self.

How exactly does that continue when the self is dead. What happens when everything is dead, how can something become reincarnated then.

&gt; ...dying and then being born again is literally reincarnation.

What aspect of yourself is being reincarnated? Otherwise it's just birth.

A woman walking into an abortion clinic has made the most difficult and devastating decisions of her life. She's about to do something that will hurt her both physically and emotionally. She wishes more than anything that she didn't have to do what she's doing, but she does. 

Anyone who harasses her, intimidates her, or in any way impedes her on the way through that door is an insensitive, selfish, misogynistic asshole and should be arrested for doing so. 

Clinics in the US (not sure about Canada) are bombarded with threats of violence daily.

2010	"Stationary in the sense that their properties do not change over time, but not in the sense that it has a single definable position.

In a classical model with a discrete electron orbiting a nucleus, you'd expect that certain properties like position to change in a regular, predictable way depending on the moment that you interact with it, such as by firing a well-aimed photon at it.

In reality this doesn't happen, it doesn't matter when you fire that photon, the result is entirely unpredictable within certain bounds, and assuming ideal conditions, those bounds never change over time either."	"It will change its spin to be opposite of that in the sub-orbital. It does this relatively easily, because the spin of an electron can be thought of being like a magnet. The up spin of an adjacent electron will cause it to flip and have a down spin, the same way a magnet pointed north will flip the north of another magnet and make it face south. This is how MRI works, by using radio waves to change the spin of electrons in hydrogen atoms in your body. 

The Pauli exclusion principle states that no electron can have all the same 4 quantum numbers as another electron. If the principle were broken, it would mean that the two electrons are the same entity, which makes them indistinguishable and therefore impossible to be two separate objects. If this happened, a lot of forms of electron spectroscopy would not work. It is also why neutron stars cannot collapse past a certain point.

In terms of the fundamental mechanism of how the electron 'knows' to change spin, I speculate it has a lot to do with our understanding of how fundamental particles interact with each other, possible something to do with the strong force but I don't know tbh.

No they don't, in 1984 they get rid of all nuanced language and have single adjectives and adverbs for everything.  Avoiding improper use of a word/making up a word that doesn't exist is the opposite of that. The lack of acknowledgement of what the word actually means and using it in ways that don't fit the definition makes the word lose the nuance and have the same meaning as the similar, correct word.  Use and utilize don't have the same meaning. In 1984 they would have gotten rid to one of them because the meaning is similar.  Using them interchangeably actually gets closer to 1984's Newspeak than acknowledging that they're different and using them appropriately.    	cringepics	cringepics	-1

The US benefited more than any other country from GATT and WTO (until 2001 when China got in).

2058	it's such a comfort to talk to him about the same stuff we did when i was 10, along with new things like politics and advice. one time i was hanging out with my SO and wanted to call him to ask about his kale recipe since we wanted to make it. ended up talking to him for like 20 minutes about photography and the night sky and all the stuff he likes. i love having excuses to call both of my parents, honestly.	"Best - Panic!

2059	I honestly have had this happen several times. I usually disappear because I can‚Äôt commit to any kind of connection like that, but it‚Äôs glorious to connect with a stranger, feel like fate brought you together, and spend all night just enjoying the magic. Have also had a guy fly in for a weekend that felt like a dream of having a live in SO, but I knew it had an expiration date when he was leaving so I didn‚Äôt panic. 	"One of my friends asked me if it was weird that we still talk the other day and it got me thinking about how our friendship is a little atypical. 

We matched on Tinder and talked all day. Never anything sexual, just about stuff we were interested in and all that. The next day we decided to meet up for sushi. We got along well and started hanging out once or twice a week after that. 

We mostly just watched TV shows or movies at his house and cuddled. We would kiss sometimes, slept together once. But we didn‚Äôt have the best physical chemistry, so we mutually decided to just be friends and kept hanging out. 

This continued for a few months. One day I went over on a Saturday afternoon around 3:00 and I couldn‚Äôt wake him up because he was passed out drunk. I knew he drank kind of a lot, but it was after that day that he really opened up to me about his depression and drinking problem. 

He said he wanted to be alone because when he goes through bad spells he doesn‚Äôt like to see people. We texted now and again a few times a week, just checking in. He got help and sobered up but shared a lot of stuff about what he was going through with me and his past. He doesn‚Äôt really have any friends because he didn‚Äôt want people to know he was struggling so he kind of pushed them away.

We don‚Äôt hang out as much anymore, but we still text daily and talk on the phone sometimes. He‚Äôs the only person I text with just to chat even though we‚Äôre both dating other people. 

The reason why it‚Äôs unconventional is because he‚Äôs really the only person I tell EVERYTHING to. I think it‚Äôs because I feel comfortable because he‚Äôs outside my normal group of friends. I live with my best friends but they‚Äôve never met him. I always went to his house because it was close to my work and he never came over mine because he was worried he would drink and drive. 

He also helped me significantly in seeing my ex‚Äôs true colors in a way that my other friends couldn‚Äôt. I was on and off with someone I was in love with for a while and he really helped me see everything clearly but totally understood why I felt the way I did.  

We talk about life stuff, movies, TV, and give each other dating advice.

Yesterday he asked me if I ever through it was weird that we still talk. We started out as a Tinder hookup kind of. And he doesn‚Äôt keep in touch with girls he meets on there because he‚Äôs not looking for a relationship so the flings are pretty short lived. 

He said if he ever got with someone he cared about he would have a hard time explaining our relationship. I was just like, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre friends, bud.‚Äù

Also, I'm not sure why""crippling depression and suicidal thoughts"" should only be understandable to people in bad situations?

I'm in a ""good"" situation, no money worries, decent job, loving parents/siblings, people think I'm a happy person... but deep down I have an indescribable sadness, only when I'm alone do I let it come out. Suicide is constantly on my mind but the only people who know about it is 1 family member and the various ""medical professionals"" that have failed to help over the last 18 years. It's a constant battle between not wanting to cause other people pain and just not knowing how much longer you can fight for.

On the monopoly: this is not wrong, unfortunately. First off, Activision decides prices in other platforms (even regional pricing), so there's no pricing issue. The playerbase's user experience isn't affected, since any functionalities are inherent to the game, not necessarily the platform.

At *most* it is s convenience issue. It isn't convenient to open Battle.net, when I usually just open Steam. Linking them, imo, is bad: I hate having to open uPlay every time I run R6 on Steam for instance.

2066	"&gt;Nothing about your method of ""debating"" says anything about me but a great deal about you.


When did I say my method of debating is telling me about you? LOL



I read your statement, which emphasizes Jesus as the 'Son of God' and this part:


&gt;he was the Son of God and that God lived through him in his perfection.



which would lead any normal person who isn't you to understand that you're implying Jesus was simply the 'Son of God' and not God himself. Since God is living through him. To the trinitarian Jesus is God, so the only way that statement would make sense in the trinitarian perspective is if you meant/said the Father was living through him. And even then it doesn't make sense because traditionally the Holy Spirit lived through Jesus and the Father was up in heaven sitting on the throne... therefore there seems a gap in your understanding of the trinity (which is why I said it 'explains a lot').



Also, trinitarians would always put the trinity in their statement of faith, always never fail it's like they're waiting for someone to ask them for it. But you didn't, which is good reason enough to make me suspect you're possibly not a trinitarian.


The simple follow up was to say 'No, I am a trinitarian'. However, you start getting defensive and break the structure of our discussion which was; impersonal and intellectual. let's return to that please"	"I think that most of us can agree that the space between physical entities in the universe is the best example of ""nothingness"" that we know. It exists in the universe, and doesn't necessarily interact with anything physical beside existing between said physical entities.

if u wanna go jc, focus on improving ur math and really making sure ur foundation is strong. esp algebra.

2078	"I'd say just start incorporating more women's clothing into your wardrobe. That's becoming much more acceptable and cool nowadays. Here's a great example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4X0FdwkryQ 

Articles of clothing like short shorts, rompers, cropped pants and even skirts are becoming more prevalent in men's fashion too, so wearing those is certainly an option. I have some very short Chubbies that I love. Tank tops are usually seen as uncool for straight guys, but I've been to many a bar where handsome gay guys wear them well. Maybe looking into gay culture/fashion would be beneficial since they tend to wear more revealing pieces. 

Another option could be investing in a sewing machine and altering clothes to your preference. This could include tailoring, combining pieces, making your own clothes from your preferred materials or even embroidering if you get a machine with that capability.

As for fabrics and elaborate design, I'd look into some high end fashion brands like Saint Laurent, Gucci, Rick Owens or the like. Outside of anything premium, most normal menswear brands tend to me more minimalist in order to appeal to a broader customer base. 

While I feel your frustrations with the constraints of men's clothing, I promise menswear can be fun. A lot of room for expression comes with looking for obscure pieces in thriftstores or non-mainstream brands, and getting inspiration to try outfits that stray from the normal. That, and layering.

As far as robots and AI, a lot of those predictions are in the direction we've been heading but we're way behind. Decades ago, people expected robot butlers, today we've got Alexa, smart fridges and roombas. There's tons of automation in manufacturing. Companies always jump at the chance to replace human workers but all we've accomplished are glorified welder bots. People expected Mars colonies and that's always been on the agenda but we're way behind on those predictions. 

I don't think it's *all* because our tech has gone in different directions. If we were developing technology faster, we very well might have ended up with a robot butler instead of Alexa. 

If people in the 50s knew how big computers and internet would be, they still probably would have thought that It'd be way ahead of where it is now. In the 90s when people could tell computers and internet were the future, they expected everything to be connected, cheap, and easy. Instead I've got meager and expensive internet access, a separate and expensive phone, separate TV. 

I dunno. I kinda think technology *is* slower than people like to think. Still really fast on a long scale, but slower than people like to think.

When you are a regular/humble person, it tends to be a verrrry foreign experience when someone you are very attracted to suddenly reciprocates and demonstrates an interest in you. It's easy to fall into self deprecating thoughts like ""THAT beautiful girl likes ME?! There must be something wrong with her."" But try to avoid that, and it can be a total mind screw. Just try to be grateful and treat her right. Have fun together. New love is awesome. It's why every second song is about love - it is an inspiring and all-consuming feeling at times.

Cheese has usually been presented as something that works if not scouted, but doesn't work if scouted.  Scouting a cheese is not particularly difficult, but a lot of people simply choose to cut that corner.

Now the person executing the cheese does usually have more experience with the situation, but that just means that that person is more skilled in this one aspect of the game because he encounters it much more often.  Printf, for instance, has practiced his cannon rushes to the point where he can win in GM with them.

But someone else in her position who was fighting tooth and nail to even *get* a job does deserve significantly more a month in food assistance, I believe.

The gender disparity in the Food Stamps program mostly stems from the fact that having children at home makes it significantly easier to qualify for the program and qualifies you to receive a lot more. In our society, women bear this burden much more frequently than men. A woman is subject to the exact same formula and receives the exact same payout as a man, assuming that all else is equal (income, cost of home/food/clothing, dependents, etc.).

I'll agree that the program is *fucked* when it comes to determining what is/is not a ""necessity."" No doubt that car insurance is a necessity of life if you live outside of NYC or LA or another city with a similarly robust public transit system.

2168	"I'm a farmer, and I raise chickens.  This article sucks. But, it's basically true. What we are dealing with is a chicken called the Cornish cross.  It is a 2nd generation hybrid from four selected lines, that is the standard meat chicken in all of the United States.  I don't know about Western Europe, or the rest of the world, because I haven't farmed there, but I suspect that it is the same at least in the UK and Western Europe. 

What they say about the chicken is true, they will grow so fast that their legs will break, if you don't kill them at about 7 or 8 weeks old, they will often die from heart failure.  Our farm is a small basically organic consumer Farm, a far cry from the large industrial agriculture depicted in this article.  But, I have tried raising the same Cornish cross chickens, thinking that if I gave them access to free range, pasture, fresh grass and bugs to eat, but they might act differently and have a different kind of life.  sadly, that's not the case. We, human beings, have figured out how to breed for obesity, and the result is this chicken.  Even on organic pasture, they will hardly move around, and will lay in front of the feeder as much as possible, to the point of laying in their own waste.

The next best meat bird is either a Red Ranger or Freedom Ranger.  They slaughter at about 12 weeks, twice as long.  That's a huge difference when you are trying to make a profit.  And, even at 12 weeks, our average weight is less than a 7.5 week Cornish Cross.  However, mortality is significantly reduced, and they forage much better.  They actually act like chickens, wandering around, eating grass and insects, and they can even sort of fly.  

Ultimately, the Cornish Cross is an amazing example of selective breeding and human ingenuity.  and, if we as a species were anywhere close to calorie deficient, I would totally support farming them.  But for me, when I look at the analysis, it only seems to work when you ignore externalities.  but, that's how most capitalism works when we look at animal welfare or the environment.  Ignore all the externalities, and create the cheapest commodity crop for mass consumption."

2171	"The reason the Alliance fell apart following the second war was because Lordaeron opted to intern the orcs rather than executing them. The surviving kingdoms did not have the finances or resources to commit to the preservation of the orcs and instead left the Alliance to focus on rebuilding their own nations instead. Had the orcs been executed, the kingdoms of the Alliance would've remained together as a monolithic bulwark against invading forces from beyond their world. When the Scourge began to arise as orchestrated by Ner'zhul (another orc no less), Lordaeron would have seen aid from Gilneas as well as Quel'thalas and likely may have been able to quell the rise of the Scourge. Hell, the full Alliance may have even heeded Medivh's council when he warned them of the coming Scourge.

Even in the worst-case scenario of Arthas falling to Ner'zhul's corrupting orchestration, there would have been far more surviving humans and elves that would be able to retreat to Kalimdor. Humans as a naturally diplomatic species would have made an earlier bid for cooperation with the night elves rather than committing to a full invasion following a misunderstanding. Hell, the only reason the night elves attacked the humans in WC3 was because they were high-strung after the orcish attack and found Jaina's humans working with the orcs and mistook them for accomplices. Realistically both sides would have lost far fewer forces and the final defense of Hyjal would have simply substituted the Horde's forces with Gilneans and additional high elves."

I'm not sure where you practice but where I am, those doctors usually have a practice composed of younger doctors who know the newest techniques and he/she basically gives them a job. But it's been fun to see the minute times the latest techniques occasionally don't solve a problem, but an old trick does. The new techniques and research is hands down 100&amp;#37; better, but I want to make sure I have it now so I can show my old tricks one day.

"Agreed, but what is the perceived gap between Mariano Rivera and Dennis Eckersely and what would that gap be if career save totals were not available? Eckersely may have been the first modern closer with gaudy numbers but he didn't start posting those numbers until the second half of his career. I'm not saying that Eckersley isn't an all time great, I'm saying that it is harder for newcomers like the op to recognize his greatness because of modest career save totals relative to the all-timers in this category. Hence the op implying that Eckersley is ``overshadowed'' by Rivera and what I am assuming is Hoffman.

Again, I am not claiming that Eckersley is left in the dust by Rivera. I am claiming that his measurable statistics do not reflect his actual dominance, so that the perceived distance between him and Rivera is closer than what it appears on paper.

2187	lol the DNC did that all on their own by running Hillary, stop blaming others for what was a terrible choice in candidate by the DNC.	"1. Not all jobs are created equal in terms of ability to progress up the economic ladder (or in simpler terms, ability to pay the bills).  Hairdressing has a much larger and, therefore, more competitive labor pool than engineering does.  As a result, opportunities to earn more money are limited--supply and demand, and all that.  I'd posit that if you gave a man or a woman the choice between being an engineer and being a hairdresser with the constraint that they'd be equally happy and capable in either job, they'd go for the engineering role just because it yields more money.
2. Women not being in STEM fields leads to a negative feedback loop in which women are falsely perceived as being incapable of thriving in STEM fields.  That, in turn, hurts women who *do* want to be in STEM fields as well as the ones that are already there (I'd also throw in that it hurts our perception of women in society in general).  Nobody bats an eye when women become nurses, doctors, politicians, even businesspeople and lawyers, and yet all of a sudden, when we talk about STEM jobs, people think it's not for women?  In a world where Grace Hopper was one of the original pioneers of computer programming and where a book and film (*Hidden Figures*) were made about black female STEM workers who contributed to the space program?

I would say that, yes, it does. There is language and words, and somebody wrote it (human authors) and somebody thought it (God).

&gt;how would you support your claim?

There is plenty of evidence out there for Biblical inspiration, I won't list them here. One main reason is that the Bible is the most textually pure historical work ever written by a huge margin. Regardless of how many times it has been translated and reprinted, it remains superiorily accurate. Whether or not you believe what is written about things we can't empirically prove is a personal issue. There is plenty of evidence out there, and as far as God is concerned, I think that there would not be any reason to think that He would not give us a record of His workings with us, and if He wrote laws and guidance down (because it is so extensive) He would most likely choose written form, as this is the best way to communicate complex ideas.

Conversely, do you not believe in Scripture? Why or why not? "	"The abrahamic religions seem to surface around a few notions present in the divinity defined by the first abrahamic documents. From a historical perspective it is expected that one who follows a newer version tries to broaden one's knowledge through this exercise of getting to know the first phenomena that gave birth to all the principles. It is also not very surprising if the idea that the first is the original faith and therefore carries all the foundation needed to help one's knowledge. I also would recommend to not only ask ""why"" but also ""how"", giving that the pursuit of religious education is individual and each person has a very specific path."

Lets look at sexual harrasment. Maybe women are underreporting sexual harrasment because they do not believe a particular act counts as harrassment. Perphaps culturally it is considered ok?

With allied races being such a thing, it feels a little weird that scaling was the only tech we got. There was a lot of discussion about this on the forums a while back, before BFA hit, that was being ""watched"". But we never really got any follow up.

We had interesting ideas like making loot feel like it counts again, by adding an alternative EXP buff to something like a tabard, so that we could choose not to lock down so many equipment slots.

There were also fun suggestions like adding the item upgrade system to the earlier quest rewards, or adding teasure hunting and bonus objectives to the maps of pre-WoD zones.

I‚Äôm not saying Samuels is as talented as Bell and yes he was a 5th round pick. But did the Steelers see him as Bells replacement? They‚Äôre very similar in skill set, both being able to play WR and RB. Also both nearly identical in height, weight and speed:

Bell: 6‚Äù1 - 225lbs  - 4.60 40 yard dash 

Samuels: 6‚Äù0 - 223lbs - 4.54 40 yard dash

 ""Although the evidence on efficacy of e‚Äêcigarettes for smoking cessation remains limited and, thus, inconclusive,19, 20 recent data from the Current Population Survey‚ÄêTobacco Use Supplement suggest that e‚Äêcigarette users in 2014 to 2015 were more likely to attempt to quit smoking tobacco cigarettes and to succeed in quitting than nonusers.30 Furthermore, population‚Äêlevel trends in cessation rates reveal that the overall rate of smoking cessation in the United States has significantly increased from 2010 to 2011 to 2014 to 2015 alongside a similar rise in e‚Äêcigarette use.30 The higher overall cessation rate found in the 2014 to 2015 Current Population Survey‚ÄêTobacco Use Supplement survey reflects a significantly higher cessation rate among those who reported e‚Äêcigarette use within the past year than those who did not (8.2% versus 4.8%), suggesting that e‚Äêcigarettes may have played a role in increasing smoking cessation in the US population.30 However, other tobacco control measures including increases in federal and local tobacco taxes and regulations, and national smoking cessation campaigns also may have contributed to improving the population‚Äêlevel cessation rates; e‚Äêcigarettes are unlikely to be the sole explanation for the higher overall cigarette cessation rates in 2014 to 2015.30"""	"You may up your nic otherwise you'll be chain vaping a lot in order to be nic full.

2221	"&gt; We should feel guilty that it happened and work to prevent it from happening again.

vs


&gt; The guilt of Jesus' death has spurned blind devotion for hundreds of selfish cults intent on keeping their followers ignorant.

If guilt has done so much evil, spurred on so much ignorance, why should we feel guilty or even propagate the story when there are other examples of mob-rule?  Doesn't it sound like it does more harm than good.

&gt;If the resurrection were literal, the act of his death would lose meaning.

Bible Quote: Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 

If the resurrection is figurative, It loses far more than meaning, it loses the truth.

Bible Quote: And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins. 

The fact that you believe he 
 was metaphorical an not a real, living, breathing person.  Can a metaphor be God? Can a metaphor create the universe?  Can a metaphor save anyone from death?
Bible Quote: And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins. 

As a metaphorical resurrection, however, it makes no sense to me. 
The apostles, were they metaphors?  Including Paul?  We have some of his letters, how can a metaphor write a letter, how can a man have met a metaphor as Paul met the apostles?

If Christ is not raised, he is not God.  If he is not absolute, he is not God.  If he cannot move an actual literal mountain, or stop the wind, he is not God. (And even if he can, I've got a few more tests.)  However, most importantly, if Christ is not raised, then we won't be either."	May I bask in your glory, oh enlightened and superior one?

I was using contactless payments since 2012 when nobody knew what I was doing.  It's not a proprietary technology. Contactless payments have been available for years, but when the iPhone 6 supported the technology, the Apple sheep acted like it was brand new and revolutionary.

Apple didn't have an App Store because they were stubborn and wanted to keep the iPhone completely proprietary.

I first had a red dot on it, and I‚Äôm not unconvinced it‚Äôs the way to go with it. The rifle is very light and handy, and no scope will approach a red dot in terms of weight. If you intend to use this rifle within 100 yards, I‚Äôd *highly* recommend a quality red dot. 

However, the Aimpoint now lives on a 10/22, so I opted for the much cheaper Primary Arms 1-6 power. They have one for 7.62x39, and it‚Äôs pretty darn sweet. Glass is decent (great for the price), but it‚Äôs the reticle that seals the deal. The 1-6 range is about what you‚Äôd want for this rifle (although it is surprisingly accurate.... like MOA@100), and the objective lens on it is small enough you can mount it really low on the rifle. Due to the low comb height, this is a good thing‚Äî also, with a 100 yard zero that 7.62 is basically a lazer pointer from 25 to 100. And it‚Äôs illuminated!

The bride points out that she's dark-skinned -- the color of [these tents](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1&amp;biw=1274&amp;bih=603&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=dLTFWteCBIrr5gLOuZ3gCg&amp;q=tents+of+Kedar&amp;oq=tents+of+Kedar&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67k1j0l2j0i24k1l2.3298.3298.0.3658.1.1.0.0.0.0.162.162.0j1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.162....0.TayDGqOQAi4#imgrc=gZIgZiIZMfWzGM:) -- but also explains that she's been in out in the sun. There's no way the sun could make someone *that* dark, if they're not of African descent. But it's the bible, so maybe she's being hyperbolic.

But it turns out Solomon's race is up for debate too. Some people argue that his mom was African, which would probably make it a single-race relationship.

Anyway, the line about the bride's skin has a lot of interesting, politically-charged [translations](http://biblehub.com/songs/1-5.htm). Is she dark-skinned *but* lovely, or dark-skinned *and* lovely? One translation went hard with ""I'm Black and beautiful!"" Which I'm all for, even though it implies a probably anachronistic understanding of race."	Not throughout history.

However! I do see a problem in the disconnect this game provides us. Humans are social creatures in general, but in this game there is almost no incentive to socialize. In fact it is nearly always the best option to strike first and without warning.

2270	"Revenger vs Pulse won't effect the flavour of your vape. They're both just devices that heat your coils. It really comes down to the style of atomizer you want to use. Once you know that you should pick a mod to suit it.

For example you wouldn't ever use a Pulse with a tank like the Crown 3. It's a squonk mod so it's only suitable for an RSA (RDA with a squonk/bottom feeding pin) If you want to use a single coil RDA, vape around 45-60w and you don't want to drip constantly then the Pulse 80 would be a great option for you.

If you wanted to use a tank like the Crown 3, Valyrian or similar the Revenger would be an infinitely better choice. A pulse can't put out enough wattage to run the coils on many tanks, and the space dedicated to the squonk bottle would be completely wasted.

Personally I get better flavour output from my Valyrian tank sitting atop a Revenger than I do from any of my RDAs on top of my Pulse. It's down to personal preference. My tanks give me better flavour but the disposable coils can be an expensive ongoing cost. It's much cheaper to rebuild/rewick an RDA for a Pulse.

If you want the flexibility of using single/dual coil RDAs or tanks and twice as much battery capacity then the Revenger is a better choice for you. If you're happy only using single coil RDAs, dealing with a bit of tweaking/rebuilding and the odd leak, you want to squonk and save money on upkeep then the Pulse 80 is a better option. Really comes down to the way you prefer to vape. Maybe hit up a local vape store and see if you can play around with both setups and get a good understanding to help decide which way you wanna go.

Hope this helps."

Blind devotion to SELFISH CULTS INTENT ON KEEPING THEIR FOLLOWERS IGNORANT?

   No. I was trying to point out the contradiction in your two statements, at least from a moral 'what we should do' point of view.  I was arguing the opposite.
   If guilt causes evil, what is the value of guilt?  Cast aside that which causes evil. Or, biblically, if your hand causes you to sin... (that part I do think is a metaphor... probably)

   I disagree that guilt over the death of christ causes evil and blind devotion.  I also oppose ignorance.  Those who have the truth have no need to keep their followers in ignorance.  Whether we feel guilty over christ, or not, the truth sets us free (from Ignorance, and more).  God is the God of truth. (Isiah 65:16)

&gt;A metaphorical/figurative resurrection is a resurrection that didn't happen in any way, shape or form whatsoever? Is that what you're saying here?

  That would appear to be the linguistic interpretation I draw from what you have said, let me know if I am wrong and if you believe in an actual literal resurrection of Christ from the dead after 3 days and into heaven.  If he was actually walking around with a hole in his side and holes in his hand after the resurrection. (Wait... Christ wasn't made whole like those who are resurrected will be, interesting).

&gt; he'd be living happy up in heaven ruling the universe.  

   Yes, that is (in essence) what I believe. However, if you are insinuating that Christ was somehow rewarded, no, that is not what I believe. He returned to his natural place, so in that sense he wasn't rewarded, simply returned to where he belonged, the death and suffering that he did not have to endure was the additional part, paid for us.  Him being in heaven is right and just, him dying, suffering, and being rejected is not.  That is what he paid for us.

&gt;John 14:48 You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
 
I am saying that the resurrection is a true literal event.  Metaphors are linguistic figures of speech in storytelling, to drag the word 'metaphor' and 'parable' in is a bit unclear by the definition, I am simply saying that the resurrection is a true literal event.  I think Paul's letters do not imply or assert Christ as non-literal.

 Christ used parables, but that does not mean he was one. Christ told stories with metaphors, but that does not mean he was one.

 The story of Audie Murphy is very inspirational, but the actual story is his account of an actual real event, not a parable, not a metaphor, an accounting of events.

&gt;&gt; Can a metaphor create the universe? Can a metaphor save anyone from death?
&gt; Yes.

No! That is a very impressive metaphor.  I am not arguing in the inspiration of civilization or the building up of history, I am talking about the literal creation of the universe, the formation of atoms and fundamental building blocks.  Did a metaphor create Jupiter? 

A metaphor is a figure of speech. a parable is a story. Can either of those stop Jupiter in a second? (I had to go big for simplicity)
  
Metaphor: a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.
Parable: a simple story used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson, as told by Jesus in the Gospels.

Neither of those can pick up a rock and throw it, much less create the sun.

&gt; As a secular Christian, none. It's all metaphor and parable.

Let's reduce this a bit (simplify it), the term 'metaphor' and 'parable' aren't really helpful.  Question, do you believe that the resurrection of Jesus christ actually, literally, occurred.  Did he die and rise again?  Will you as a flesh-and-blood breathing human being?  My memory is not me, I have a pulse, my memory does not, it's not who I am, I believe we will VERY LITERALLY be resurrected from DEATH by the power of God through Christ. 

Question(Intended rhetorically, but I'll accept answers): Can you name one Christian born after Christ but before 300AD whose name is not recorded therein or in any historical documents. Can you ask Paul who ""lives on in memory""? Name a Christian tailor who lived in ancient Rome.  Tell me your great-grandfathers favorite color.  If he 'lives' in memory, ask him.  By life, I mean life. By lives, I mean lives and breathes. To live on in memory is a figure of speech, an idiom.  To equate what I mean to what you mean is a fallacy of equivocation.

The same can be said of our definitions of God. It's not what Christ offered, nor is it anything I care about.  If being remembered is the reward, why pray in secret? (Matthew 6:6).

What I define as God, is very REAL, he would exist without words, without memory, without us, he would still exist. He existed before anything else, and he would continue to exist even if every book were erased and every mind rendered blank, and even if I didn't define him.  If every man on this planet perished God could still raise them all up with less effort than it takes me to draw breath, and he could flood the world if he hadn't promised not to.

&gt; If helping people is a sin, I don't want to meet God.

Helping people is not a sin, and if that is all you've done in your life, I'm impressed.

&gt; If a miraculous pit of fire and torture are waiting for me, I'll gladly suffer knowing an evil God is responsible for my pain, and what I did in life is a thing I am proud of.

God is not evil. Suffering is earned. Helping people is not a sin (have you really not sinned?). An evil God wouldn't allow you to confess your sins and be forgiven. (John 20:23)  An evil God wouldn't spare the world for a few righteous who could be saved and command them to save one another, thus saving as many as he could.  An evil God wouldn't warn Adam and Eve before the fall, he'd simply laugh at their misfortune.  If anyone would like to discuss ""The problem of evil"" (basically, is God evil), I will discuss that later, but the scope is beyond this thread."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot they are good for, but aside from Ecclesiastes nothing in it really seems to grapple with existentialism. It's later theologians and (frequently Christian) philosophers who discuss the anticipatory challenges we must overcome before we can actualize to a point at which the advice in the Bible makes a meaningful impact.

For example, Matthew 18:15 is great for mending a relationship, but I haven't found a verse that can motivate you to do the thing; They provide means but no motivation- What merit does this end have over that one? Is there some sort universal tragedy if some ass grows apart from? If so, how so, when I and he are ultimately inconsequential?

There's a burning drive to explain everything with the self consistency and rigidity of a mathematical proof, but some things remain mysterious- Impervious to Earthly explanation. Harder and harder to believe when we can say with confidence the composition of stars and the behavior of atoms, but the Truth is that mysteries abound wherever you look, and that in the face of them, some choices are easy for our guts to make, even as our brains flail for meaning.

Why do strawberries taste good? Because they taste good, what more reason does a thing need? Why must everything have an ironclad chain of reason?

As for the specific mystery of the shape of death, I recommend the remarks of Twain and Epicurus: 

 &gt; I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it.
 --Mark Twain

 &gt; Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here. And when it does come, we no longer exist.
--Epicurus

As God's Elect we have an eternity to grapple with post-existence- An eternity in the presence of The Father. Who better to console our fears with an explanation? We ought not let tomorrow's lessons detract from today's chores. 

It doesn't keep the mind from wandering, though. Here's what I reckon, inspired by CS Lewis; You don't have a Soul, You ARE a Soul, you HAVE a Body. If we are not the meatsacks that hold us, then perhaps we are patterns of behavior. Perhaps some level of reincarnation really is at work (I've seen no explicit denial), and there's only a few of us, tried again and again in this suit and that one. The eternal aspect isn't our hair color or shoe size, it's our pattern of thought which God can use ever after.

For example, a cover of a song or brand of humor visited on a topic. My earthly existence was the theatrical cut of a movie, but ever after God will be entertained by the Director's Cut, reruns, crossover episodes of His own design. This is how Mortals perceive Immortality on Earth; Hitchcock, from beyond the grave, continues to influence film. Bach's influence on music persists. Maybe that's what God will use from us; ""This is how Chris made pancakes on Earth, and they were basically perfect, so this is how we make pancakes in Heaven.""

Nobody I've ever shared that with seems particularly keen on that version of Heaven, which is fine, because I don't have any reason to think my prediction is any better than theirs. Maybe mine will change- I'm 26 and death seems distant. But whatever I imagine it to be won't change the Truth- It's a Mystery by God's Design, and is ultimately irrelevant.

It's kind of a shout back at the Universe; ""I'm pointless and irrelevant? Fuck you, YOU'RE pointless and irrelevant, see if I care! I know what I'm about and unbothered by my ignorance of your pointless mysteries."" You don't owe the Universe an explanation, and it doesn't owe you one. You owe *yourself* a purpose, and you're the only one who has to be satisfied with it.

Uhh...

&gt; Such claims of infallibility or universality were never made by any ancient popes, any bishops in general, or any of the councils.

You're very clearly linking infallibility and universality. 

&gt; Popes throughout history have tried claiming some form of supremacy over the Church, and have always been shut down by the rest of the patriarchs.

Uh, *what*? Is this a joke statement? Literally **fifty years before the schism you have the Patriarch of Constantinople (Eustathius) asking the Bishop of Rome to recognize Constantinople's rights to rule over the East as Rome ruled ***universally***. Photius - *Photius*, your hero - appealed to the pope to solve the dispute over his ""succession"" over Ignatius. You can at least recognize the historical reality then attempt to downplay it. This complete revisionism is ridiculous. 

&gt; But the egotism of Rome leads them to profess that it magically wasn't the other 4 patriarchates who were right, but rather the one man standing on a hill shouting for power...

Didn't you just invoke Canon 28 of Chalcedon?! The **same canon where the Patriarch of Constantinople attempts a power grab**? Are you joking? Rome kept the Eastern Patriarchs with all their wiles and intrigues in check. It's no secret that Orthodoxy struggles with the same problems today as they did 1000 years ago.

Followed shortly, no doubt, by Martin's *The Winds of Winter* and Rothfuss' *Doors of Stone*.
"	"&gt; If nationality is only relevant user profile pages, why would I be joining into the nationality tables in other features? Each of my users has a lot of different pieces of data associated with them (posts, reports, personal application preferences, friends, replies, messages, etc.). The notion that I have to join into every single one of these when loading every single page in a large feature is plainly false.

How do you treat partially loaded users in your code then? You've got the `if exists(repo.hasTeams)` problem only much more widespread and impossible to ever fix.

&gt; ?

That way you'll get users with only their German nationality even if they actually have multiple nationalities. If you then modify those users and update, it would be very easy to accidentally remove their other nationalities.

&gt; Actually you don't have to do anything. Your database does it for you.

It does, as part of your write, and you have no direct control over it. Writes too slow because of your index updates? Too bad, buy a bigger server.

&gt; With NoSQL you either need to be absolutely sure that you are always either updating users through a common abstraction that handles index updates, or calling your user index update immediately after your user record update unless you can tolerate your indexes becoming out of sync.

Or you have your index building pipeline feeding from your user pipeline, so any written users will become part of the index. You end up doing the same thing an RDBMS would be doing behind the scenes (because RDBMSes are fundamentally good engineering and the whole field converges on the same solutions to the same problems), but with more visibility and control over it, and without having to fake a model that doesn't fit. (E.g. any serious RDBMS these days will use MVCC, so your long-running report is actually operating on a snapshot of what your table used to look like - which is what you want - but most won't give you direct visibility and control over that snapshot because the RDBMS interface requires them to pretend that the table is a single thing being mutated in place).

&gt; With SQL you can also plan for large operations (be it schema changes or long running reports).

Up to a point. The tooling and visibility around these things is distinctly secondary, in my experience; they're expected to be rare, so they're less first-class; even if the database itself has good support, the language APIs probably won't. Whereas a NoSQL system absolutely needs to have a good interface for aggregation jobs.

Theoretically you could do everything I've been advocating in a traditional RDBMS - append-only event tables for all your raw input, materialised views for all your intermediate pipelines (and then you achieve a ""schema change"" in a smoother way by creating the new view, migrating things to it, and eventually dropping the old one), indices, and aggregations, and there's usually some kind of interface for running a slow report at a low priority without proper transaction isolation when you don't want it to interfere with live updates. But you're going against the grain, and you're giving up most of the advantages that the RDBMS was supposed to give you - e.g. if you're using a materialised view as a manual ""index table"" (which is the solution I've seen to ""I want index updates to happen eventually, but not block the live transaction"") then the query planner can no longer choose whether to use your index for ad-hoc queries, you have to decide explicitly anyway. At some point the RDBMS side of things is costing you more than you gain.

&gt; Write and run the code to do it, and NoSQL will happily accept just about any operation at any time.

Statistics for the premier pvp mode, Trials of Osiris and its D2 analogue, Trials of the Nine.

Last week, Trials of the Nine was down to 55k participating accounts on all 3 platforms, down from a million on launch. Destiny 1 also had about a million players when HoW launched. At its very lowest, in the last month before Destiny 2 launched, it was triple D2's current numbers at 150k. 

**It took 3 years for D1 to shed 850k trials players. It took just over 6 months for D2 to shed 950.**

The playerbase for D2, which was close to D1 (again, *we have the API that gives us playercounts*) has haemorrhaged. Destiny 2 is not addicting compared to D1. This is the mistake that was originally mentioned.

I've been able to take the same skill set and find a much more professionally fulfilling life. I spent several years either wrapped up in government work, which was a mess of problems in and of itself (circa government shutdown era, and the budget changes to scientific agencies that accompanied that), or else trying to find contractor work, which was often only for short term engagements. Even as a government contractor, I was frequently dealing with ""renewable three month"" contracts, that would go on for years. It was painful, and I'm happy I'm in a much better place.

2338	"&gt;Several days later Murray asked me about a tourist attraction known as the most photographed barn in America.¬† We drove 22 miles into the country around Farmington.¬† There were meadows and apple orchards.¬† White fences trailed through the rolling fields.¬† Soon the sign started appearing.¬† THE MOST PHOTOGRAPHED BARN IN AMERICA.¬† We counted five signs before we reached the site.¬† There were 40 cars and a tour bus in the makeshift lot.¬† We walked along a cowpath to the slightly elevated spot set aside for viewing and photographing.¬† All the people had cameras; some had tripods, telephoto lenses, filter kits.¬† A man in a booth sold postcards and slides -- pictures of the barn taken from the elevated spot.¬† We stood near a grove of trees and watched the photographers.¬† Murray maintained a prolonged silence, occasionally scrawling some notes in a little book.¬†

&gt;""No one sees the barn,"" he said finally.¬†

&gt;A long silence followed.¬†

&gt;""Once you've seen the signs about the barn, it becomes impossible to see the barn.""

&gt;He fell silent once more.¬† People with cameras left the elevated site, replaced by others.

&gt;**""We're not here to capture an image, we're here to maintain one.** Every photograph reinforces the aura.¬† Can you feel it, Jack? An accumulation of nameless energies.""

&gt;There was an extended silence.¬† The man in the booth sold postcards and slides.¬†

&gt;""Being here is a kind of spiritual surrender.¬† We see only what the others see.¬† The thousands who were here in the past, those who will come in the future.¬† We've agreed to be part of a collective perception.¬† It literally colors our vision.¬† A religious experience in a way, like all tourism.""¬†

"	"Really?  Please read the OP's post.  He says nothing about pixels or general image quality.  It is specifically about low light:

""I always see people not recommend M43 or APS-C because FF's bigger sensor lets in low light, ...""

Collecting light is the key to low light because the S/N we see is the square root of the total light collected from a subject.    In your Andromeda galaxy example, collecting more light from stars in a larger field of view does not help image quality of the galaxy itself.  People perceive images of subject(s) not pixels or large fields of view that are not relevant to the subject.

Great writers have an ending in mind, and work backwards. They may not have an exact ending in mind, but they certainly have a general idea. JJ doesn't work like that. JJ just throws stuff out that seems cool, and then runs with it. Then he hops ship on the project and everyone else is left to try to come up with some batshit answer to his plotpoints, which end up making ZERO sense. And then they get the blame for it.

JJ did it on Lost, and he also did it with TFA and TLJ, and I'm fairly certain he's going to do it on the final SW saga movie as well. And he's clearly shown he takes this approach on Cloverfield.

He's simply introduced the Multiverse plotline now so that he can get away with it. Anything flies now. Multiverse."	"I watched Bullitt fairly recently and it didn't blow my skirt up.

2360	"TL;DR ‚Äî

I really want to know - how is it that you came to the point where you genuinely felt indebted to and ashamed in front of God? Aside from the threat of hell, the fear of being rejected by people and being told over and over that you‚Äôre a miserable sinner in need of God‚Äôs grace, when you‚Äôre alone and 100% honest with yourself, do you believe you owe God an apology? 

***

I recently deconverted from Christianity after nearly three decades as a believer. I‚Äôm still searching though. While it seems most likely that humans created the idea of God (just like the millions of other gods), I want to know Him and all about Him if He really is Truth. I don‚Äôt want to be deceived. And I don‚Äôt want to deny reverence to whom it is due. 

I am honest and quick to apologize to people when I‚Äôve offended or hurt them in any way. I am imperfect, but I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it. I just take responsibility and keep learning and growing. I love hearing truth and wisdom. It‚Äôs so refreshing!

While I strive to be humble, I also don‚Äôt automatically feel guilty just because someone says I should feel guilty (insert Sunday School teacher). I resist people‚Äôs attempts to manipulate - especially when I see them using shame as a tactic to further their own agenda. 

This happens frequently in Christian circles, during sermons and it‚Äôs in worship songs (now everyone stand and sing about what a broken, shameful, weak, lost, blind, unworthy wretch you are.) I go to church every week to be with my family, so I see it all the time. Makes me sad!

I‚Äôm reading Jesus Among Other Gods by Ravi Zacharias at the moment. I‚Äôm 75% finished. It‚Äôs been an interesting read, but I find myself going back to all my unanswered questions...

If God created humans and put us here on earth, why do we have to essentially apologize for being alive? Isn‚Äôt that His problem? He‚Äôs the father, we‚Äôre the children, right? Why do we have to ask him for forgiveness? Doesn‚Äôt it seem backwards? 

If God wants to have a personal relationship with his creation, why did he make us physical beings and remain invisible? And then why does he tell us to seek him? What parent would say to their newborn, ‚Äúif you want to live, you better look for me or I will not nourish you or accept you‚Äù It‚Äôs like a cruel game of hide and seek. 

Again, why do you apologize to God? Why do you need his grace and forgiveness? 




"	"That would be an Old Covenant Law, meant only for the Hebrews. We are under the New Covenant, who are in Christ. We are not bound by the Levitical Law, but the Law of Love for God and our fellow man. In other words, we are not bound to the Letter of the Law, but to the Spirit of the Law.

The spirit of that law remains, but not the literal expression of it. Self harm is unhealthy, and Christ calls for His Church to be examples of healthy living for the world, as well as moral living, as well as gracious compassionate and merciful living. Tattoos, in and of themselves, are not a sin to a Believer. However, if your conscience tells you it is a sin for you as an individual, then it is a sin for you. We should never burden our own conscience just to test God.

If your conscience is clear, allow none to judge you but yourself and your Creator. (He is loving and merciful by the way)"	Christianity	Christianity	-1

why do people bring up a pay equation? the multiplier is interchangeable at discretion.

what balance how do u balance that? should a CEO get paid 2% of the collective income of the entire companies workforce? should they get a base 200k salary then get a 5-10% bonus on the companies profits.

there are multiple ways of calculating a CEO's pay and you cant boil it down to a balanced pay equation. 

pay isn't everything - especially when it comes to making a decision that could potentially ruin lives.

maybe there isn't a satisfactory answer, but its still a search that needs to continue.

I get a possibility a goal out of defending this.

nice political assumption, welfare has never directly affected my life, tbh there are different reasons people cant get jobs or have to live on welfare, its the people that pick the loopholes of those systems that really generate disgust.

they dont have to be the hardest or smartest workers. but they have to be strategic and conceptual. these people manage the overall direction of a company.

they might be but not all of them are.

board members are different, there are executive and non executive. non execs usually hold large shares in the business. executives are generally employees of a company, who are given managerial control over the company.

and your pay isn't measured by how ""hard"" you work its about what you provide to the company and its stakeholders. 

pay always scales with responsibility and not ""work"" no matter the difficulty or ""hard"" degree of it.

1. Siren v2
 - Pros: Great build deck, 4,5ml capacity (24mm version), great airflow adjustment ring on the outside with many options
 - Cons: Big height

2. Hastur MTL
 - Pros: Similarly good build deck as the Siren v2, big capacity (3,5ml), included different coil airflow inlays
 - Cons: Need to empty tank before accessing build deck, top part doesn't stay together to hold the juice. Need to remove coil to change airflow inlay. ~~Airflow-ring on the outside isn't as specific as on the Siren and Berserker.~~

3. Berserker Mini 
 - Pros: Small form factor and as good flavour as the above
 - Cons: Might gurgle and temporarily leak when not bottom-filled (depends on wicking)

Bonus:

4. Kayfun Prime - don't need to get the expensive original. Just search for YFTK Prime around FastTech and others :)
 - Pros: Small form factor, beats any other MTL RTA imo flavour-wise, optional tank extender for 4,5ml and customizability with steel tanks. Easy as can be to wick. 
 - Cons: Very tiny build deck, not the easiest to build.

Something is an objective moral claim if the moral value is clear to all viewers, regardless of their identity. Something is subjectively moral if the moral value would vary across different viewers. It is absolutely a misapplication of the term to describe a 'group-wide' morality as objective, or 'objective to a particular group'. That is what the word subjective is for.

I disagree. Both are factually correct:

 - The area is 3x the size of France.
 - The amount of plastic is equivalent to a Walmart packed 1 foot deep.

Neither of these discuss the impact of the plastic. Both are relevant. Again, if you took the same garbage and spread it out 2x as far, does that make the issues 2x as bad? Of course not, so the ""area"" isn't very relevant for scope, except to say what areas may be affected.

2430	"&gt; We have written, historical accounts of Jesus.

Well, no - we don't. At least, there are no *contemporary* records. Even if we grant that the [*testimonium flavium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus) is authentic (and very few scholars do), it dates from AD 70 and was written by someone who was a not an eyewitness to Jesus' ministry.

There are a few other highly suspicious points - both of the gospel birth narratives (in Matthew and Luke) are very obviously spurious. They are clearly two completely different stories set at least ten years apart from each other. Even the two genealogies are hopelessly contradictory. In addition, the majority of the New Testament was written by someone who never met Jesus - by his own admission. And the letters that are supposedly written by his disciples contain no biographical details at all. It seems as if Jesus' birth and early life are completely unknown, and the details of this period found in the gospels are entirely fictional.

On the other hand, this could be explained by the simple fact that Jesus was not nearly as well known as the gospels claim, and that the birth narratives were actually invented to try and claim a prophetic fulfillment for Micah 5:2 (which, at a cursory reading, implies that the Messiah must come from Bethlehem). It's telling that literally none of the remainder of the NT ever mentions the birth in Bethlehem. Paul fails to mention it, even when it would have provided a strong point to bolster his argument that Jesus was the Jewish Messiah. Further - it contradicts John 7, in which Jesus seems to agree with the sentiment that he was born in Galilee.

I accept that it's probably more likely that Jesus existed than not - but the evidence is not nearly as strong as Christians like to believe."	"&gt; You can always repair a computer or change its battery. You can't do that with a human legally deceased.

I originally felt bad that I didn't get a manual and that I sacrificed horsepower even though I saved a few thousand dollars. Now though, I see how rarely I'm even able to stretch my GTI's legs. I would be even more frustrated if I had to drive a Mazdaspeed3 or WRX so tamely. I have a short commute on city streets and rarely take the interstate/highway. When I do take the highway, there's inevitably some asshole in the left most lane going the speed limit (my city is famous for that). Moreover, my city also has dumbass speed limits and plenty of cops to enforce them (and expensive tickets! Even 10 over is like $200). We literally have a beautiful, brand new stretch of wide open, 5 lane interstate that is almost never crowded. The speed limit is a frustrating 60mph and cops love to hang out there.

So yeah, I'd say I'm in the same boat with you. As long as I live where I live, I see no need to get anything more powerful than my GTI.  I still love my GTI, and I do have enjoyable drives sometimes, and can find roads that are fun, but 90% of my driving is pretty standard, every day driving.

"3.5g of weed that is 20% THC has 700mg of THC in it. The standard dose of an edible in Colorado is 10mg. 700mg of THC is 70 doses. Even divided into 15 pieces, that's 4.7 doses per brownie. In my experience, 2 doses is just right. For someone who weighs twice as much as me, they would need 4 doses to feel the same effect.

Now, maybe weed in the 1970s, which might have been 5% THC, wouldn't make brownies that would do this to a person. 3.5g of weed that is 5% THC has 175mg of THC in it. The standard dose of an edible in Colorado is 10mg. 175mg of THC is 17.5 doses. Divided into 15 pieces, that's 11.7mg THC per brownie, a little over 10mg.

1g of weed that is 20% THC has 200mg of THC in it. That's enough for 20 pieces with 10mg each.

The read to kernel memory is executed speculatively under a condition that is false (e.g. an if() block which the branch predictor has been trained to believe will be taken, but won't this time).  Before that branch can be resolved (this can be delayed, for instance by making it dependent on data which is not in the cache), the ""invalid"" read and the subsequent dependent read are executed speculatively.  Eventually the branch gets resolved and the speculative execution (including the fault) is unwound, but the effect of that second dependent read on the cache can be detected afterwards.

This is why the attack works - on the invalid read the processor notes that the permissions are wrong and it should be faulted, but as it's speculative it cannot deliver the fault until the speculation is resolved.  The speculation is allowed to continue and speculatively execute the second read because it would require more complex hardware to stop it, and (prior to this attack) it was thought to be harmless."	programming	programming	-1

They are related by the very definition of order. From Wikipedia:

&gt;The axioms for a non-strict partial order state that the relation ‚â§ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. That is, for all a, b, and c in P, it must satisfy:

&gt;* *a* ‚â§ *a* (reflexivity: every element is related to itself).

&gt;* if *a* ‚â§ *b* and *b* ‚â§ *a*, then *a* = *b* (antisymmetry: two distinct elements cannot be related in both directions).

&gt;* if *a* ‚â§ *b* and *b* ‚â§ *c*, then *a* ‚â§ *c* (transitivity: if a first element is related to a second element, and, in turn, that element is related to a third element, then the first element is related to the third element).

And then you define *a* &lt; *b* as *a* ‚â§ *b* ‚àß *a* ‚â† *b*.

&gt; This is not something that was ever guaranteed by C++ initially, but people knew they could assume that, and things went on.

Floats had no total order from the very beginning, even in C. So it shouldn't have been unexpected. No one who hasn't slept their way through the intro class on C++ would assume that always `(a == b || a &lt; b || a &gt; b)`

2502	Is looking at family album, remembering your childhood plays being a manchild? As long as you don't fuck children I see no problem.	"This is a great example of anecdotal evidence over actual real scientific evidence, and I heavily caution anyone reading this to think critically and do research before following this advice.

Ages 6 to 9 are the perfect age window to broach the subject of Sex, as children have a maximum of curiosity and a minimum of embarrassment about their lack of understanding.

This is a widely accepted fact amongst most child psychologists and is very easy to find information about online.

However, the most important reason for him to be honest goes much deeper than that. Sex is a subject that most people avoid like the plague with their children, and that makes children learn to avoid talking about it with their parents. This is a chance for him to be vulnerable, open, honest, and informative with his daughter. This is his chance to establish himself not only as a resource but also someone who will always be there for advice and for help. 

People who can‚Äôt even properly distinguish which They‚Äôre/their/there to use at the start of their sentences probably should refrain from giving advice about SERIOUS situations that could have SERIOUS repercussions for a father/daughter relationship forever. 

‚ÄúThey think love is what a family shares, not sexual partners.‚Äù Right, let‚Äôs say that‚Äôs true, then that‚Äôs the entire point of having a conversation with the child. You can help them learn what Love is; why it‚Äôs so essential prior to Sex, and answer any immediate questions they might have, establishing yourself as a resource on the topic, as open to discuss it, and as a genuine and honest parent.

When you say that you shouldn‚Äôt teach someone about a subject because they don‚Äôt know the subject yet, it‚Äôs a complete oxymoron. Knowledge doesn‚Äôt just appear out of nowhere at a set age. It‚Äôs not like his daughter will wake up at age 9 and suddenly understand what love between sexual partners is. The entire point of this thread is that his daughter doesn‚Äôt exactly understand and he needs to help her get there. Your advice can‚Äôt be, oh she doesn‚Äôt know A so don‚Äôt explain A until she knows A.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

I get it. This is the internet and you‚Äôre anonymous and so this doesn‚Äôt feel real. But I want you to know that following your advice would have had a substantial negative impact comparatively with following expert advice and widely accepted professional and medical opinions about the topic. You could have had an actual, substantial negative effect on a real father and a real daughter and their relationship. It‚Äôs not funny to try and bore her out of learning, and it‚Äôs not funny to make up fictional age barriers of the understanding of a topic.

So... how would you account for or address the following scenario:

1. Corporate developers and landlords see their bottom line impacted by these rent control limits.

2. They turn all of their existing units into condominiums to sell, and do not renew the rental leases of their current occupants.

3. They use the money from the condos they sell to buy cheaper apartment units in poorer areas, and bump up rent prices to account for the rent control limitations.

4. The supply of cheaper rental units tanks. New supply is priced higher in poorer areas.

5. Rental prices and property values increase in these poorer areas, accelerating gentrification.

6. Suddenly, the poor and/or disenfranchised population you hoped to help find themselves in a weird situation. Their rent may be controlled, but if their landlord ever decides to sell or not renew their leases, they have no options, as they're priced out of their area and displaced. Property values and rent prices are now increasing more rapidly.

Earthquakes are an unavoidable consequence of how the earth is constructed. So, why didn't your holy book tell humans not to live anywhere near the Ring of Fire? Didn't your god care? If he is real, why did he make this planet such a death trap? I repeat, *this is how the surface of the planet works.*

2- If your god is real, why did he invent malaria, the biggest killer of our species? Why also invent the perfect delivery vector, the mosquito? What does he have against us?

2553	"&gt; I'm a Millennial with a mortgage who is dumping plenty into his 401k and I'm curious about what I could be doing better.

I assume you mean retirement-wise.

401k is a great start.   Minimally, you should at least be putting in up to the employer match. Optimally you would be able to max it out to get the full tax benefit. 

Also you should consider a Roth IRA which you can put up to $5,500 a year for a single, or $11,000 a year for a couple.   It can grow post tax.

If possible, you may want to consider a Health Savings Account which can also be funded pre-tax and both the gains and contributions are tax-free provided they are spent on medical.  Ultimately, almost everyone will have medical expenses though.  And, under current rules, you can wait to withdraw the reimbursements for many years which allows it to be use as a pseudo-retirement fund.

Possibly something like a 529 plan for future education related expenses can also be a good idea. And a brokerage can help serve as a place to store that growing emergency fund.

I would say those are the big ones.  But it can definitely get more complicated depending on your personal situation.  Start by reviewing [this handy link and associated flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). 

Get rid of debt, pay yourself first, establish good habits, and maybe check out /r/financialindependence/ if financial independence or early retirement is a goal.

2570	The conflicting Shia and Sunni claim are from David Wood's video I linked in the OP. He mentions it in the beginning but am not sure if he provides specific citations from Shia and Sunni favoured hadiths.	"&gt; If you think that no atheist has ever made the arguments that the OC referenced above, you are the one who is wrong.

If they did, I, and probably many other non-believers, would correct that blatantly false statement.  And that isn't the point.  The point is he made that up to be some strong argument that atheists make then easily defeats it, claiming victory.  Thats dishonest and pathetic.

&gt; And saying something like ""No, no atheist has ever said these things. I know because, apparently, I know everything."" is incredibly dismissive.

Its calling out bullshit.  Don't put words in my mouth or you are being just as dishonest as him.

&gt; You might as well have responded ""NUH-UH"" and it would've been virtually the same thing.

I am sorry you can't understand what that person was doing.  There was no need to dive into their baloney when it was so patently obvious what he was doing.  I guess it wasn't obvious to you.  You will know better for next time."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

So, I started looking for the audio-book at the library, and have been listening to the CDs on my commute.  SO AWESOME!  The main reason that I wanted to re-engage (I can't bring myself to say ""re-read"", since I'm not actually reading) is that I knew that I had missed important background layers back in my adolescence and early twenties, the last time I read it.

Dang straight.  Herbert was brilliant."	"I'm looking for books about the process of reading itself. It seems to me that reading is quite a subjective phenomenon. There are times when I pick up a book which is I know is good but somehow I can't read it. Either I can't relate, the language is not to my liking (to challenging, outdated or too simplistic and new-agey). Other times I pick up a book that I can't put down. Yet other times a change of scenery, life circumstances or location makes me much more prone to reading. Sometimes its just my mood.

I want to see if I can maximize positive reading experiences. I have found that too many times I pick up a book that I drop halfway through and feel guilty that I couldn't finish, or force myself to complete a book which I later realize wasn't worth the effort (once I'm done). 

Why is reading sometimes an amazing experience but other times outright painful? What makes some books click with some people and others click with other people? Any books that explore this topic?"	books	books	-1

2574	"&gt;Yes, ok, you can set up the customize ring to be an aperture ring but then you loose direct visual feedback on your lens.

Yeah, if it's just an aperture ring I feel the same way. And personally, I prefer old film camera controls and the way Fuji has carried that on. To me the most exciting possible new camera would be something like an Epson R-D1 update, I'm squarely on Team Aperture Ring. But for this I'm thinking more in terms of using a ""customize everything"" modern system, and to me the custom ring splits the difference between old and new controls very well. Especially for bodies with a top LCD display like the Canon, where you can see settings at a glance."	"I suggest you do at *least* 20 or 30 proper portrait shoots before you start thinking about charging people money. You need to be confident that you can deliver consistent quality, with a variety of subjects and a variety of circumstances. 

These days, everybody who buys a DSLR and takes a few ok portraits thinks they're owed money. They know they can find a decent background, set a wide aperture, and take a picture that looks better than a smartphone. I think being a portrait photographer who's worth money should be a lot more than that. You don't have to be a world class photographer to take some senior portraits for cash, but there are things about poses, expressions, angles, perspective, lighting, and postproduction that simply take more than a handful of shoots to learn to do well - not to mention the social interactions and all the curveballs that a shooting situation can throw at you.  

Don't rush, just put in the hours. It will work out better for your clients as well as for yourself. "	photography	photography	-1
2575	Wow. I filled out my medical exam form thing yesterday to take pilot lessons. Had no idea. (But no kidney stones yet.)	"Oh, please don't misunderstand. I absolutely don't believe opposition is equal to disinterest. I would much rather my party of choice was simply not interested in a favorable (in my opinion) policy, rather than it being against it.

But I also don't believe it should serve as a redeeming quality that any particular party does not consider failing infrastructure worth the political labor. Where a party focuses its lens says as much about its priorities as its members' individual voting records, I believe. 

In shorter terms, I agree that a party does not deserve the same degree of condemnation for simply not focusing on an issue; but I think it is absolutely abhorrent that a party supposedly working for the middle class does not consider infrastructure reform a worthwhile political investment.

2576	"Hey all. Just found this sub and gotta say this community is awesome. I know there‚Äôs posts similar to this and the advice is usually ‚Äúget back on the horse!‚Äù But I feel as though this may still be worth asking. Anyway, I‚Äôll make this as short as possible. 

About 5 years ago I took a basic rider course and got my motorcycle endorsement and couldn‚Äôt wait to get on a bike. I bought a couple of ninja 250‚Äôs in succession- both of which I totaled in the first *two weeks* of having them. The first one slid out on me when I hit some gravel I didn‚Äôt see in a relatively low speed turn, and the second one I rear ended a driver who cut me off. Though I don‚Äôt consider myself a reckless rider or someone who takes risks, my reaction time and hazard recognition wasn‚Äôt fast enough and I need to work on that.

Though I thankfully walked away with no injury from either accident, they have both left me significantly shaken and nervous about getting back at it, even after 5 years. The passion and excitement for riding is still definitely there in full force, and I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of getting another beginner bike (ninja 300/650, FZR 600, CBR 300/500, etc.) with the expectation that I would take another MSF course focused on safe street skill building. I‚Äôm wondering if- given my track record- this is something you would advise against. Totaling two bikes so quickly got me wondering if it was just bad beginners luck, or if I‚Äôm just one of those people who doesn‚Äôt have the necessary skill set for riding. What recommendations do you have for me? Courses? Bikes? Should I even bother? Thanks in advance!"	Maybe you could look into a Honda Cb500x?

Slight tangent, but I recently ordered something online and it‚Äôs scheduled to arrive next Friday. Being so accustomed to Amazon same day or next day delivery, my first thought was ‚Äúare they shipping it from the moon??‚Äù.

2580	"&gt;You have brought up no such scenario where you cannot use the exposure meter of the camera to determine exposure. Please provide me one. Because so far you haven't said anything of the sort.

Concerts, venues with stage/spotlights, extremely dim/bright backgrounds relative to the subject, etc.  

&gt;those are consumer level functions made for grandma who doesn't know cameras.

That's what I was addressing, and used those cameras as examples that are being used for serious work.  My intention wasn't to talk smack, since I'm a firm believer in using what's best for one's own needs, which is why I own the camera that I do and not an A7Riii.  I compared your cameras to mirrorless flagships to see if you would still hold to your stance that they were simply consumer toys, being that they feature ""consumer level functions"". 

&gt;You should not need a feature like that to be able to expose a shot, can it help if you are lazy or ignorant, sure thing, but I would not want someone who was dependent on it.

Exposure preview is a technological advancement, just like the first light/exposure meter.  So why are you dependent on a light meter to properly expose a shot, which is an aid, when you already know the basics?  Dismissing exposure preview is analogous to being Amish.

2584	"&gt; and not NKs nuclear testing site imploding?

Test enough nuclear devices inside of a mountain, and the mountain will fail - that's just the law of physics.

The bigger reason that NK nuclear tests may stop is because they have achieved a successful nuclear arsenal. While the rest of the world continually wrote of their failed tests, they learned from their mistakes and can now successfully deliver a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. That was their stated goal from the start and they have accomplished it.

This is the only reason nuclear testing may stop. If they needed another mountain, they could have built a new test site in a new mountain.

Now, for the question of denuclearization? The Kim Dynasty will never give up their nuclear weapons. It is their insurance plan against destabilization."	Anywhere you can own an acre of land is going to be cheap compared to urban areas, where a majority of jobs are. 40k where i am, puts you living almost paycheck to paycheck. And if you incur an extra expense somewhere  (car repair, hospital visit etc), you may be set back for years. The issue here is that the mefian income in my area is only about 50k, which means about half of the city is just barely msking it. In order to own property around here, you need to be making around 70 or 80k, which is doable for above median income folks that are married with 2 incomes. Now, the kicker? This metro is considered good COL compared to othet places. Also, remember that civil servant jobs usually have a lower salary and much better benefits. Your insurance costs and retirement package are much better than most people's. A 40k job in the private sector may be much worse off than 40k in the public sector. 	pics	pics	-1

The amount of psychological support for either type is quite limited. Mental healthcare for men is a joke. 	"I suspect that these figures reflect sampling bias. She worked with women offenders, and saw a skewed sample. Its a common mistake that even people who should no better (like psychologists) make.

I have no doubt that there are far more women sex offenders than is commonly believed. Current best guesses suggest that 20% of sexually abused males are abused by women, but there are multiple factors that suggest this is an underestimate, starting with a simple denial of the possibility that women abuse. I have heard social workers state that women do not commit such offences. If they believe this they are hardly likely to identify the problem. 

Just like female violence, false accusations and the unlawful killing of children (where women appear to be a very large if not majority of perpetrators), this issue is overdue a rethink in the public mind, but lets not make the feminist mistake of  using dodgy data to 'prove' a point."

2615	"Your regard to our governmental budget and Kentucky is ignorance at best, stupid at worst. Your regard to schools and spending is taken from a few Google searches or reddit posts, as your words amply reflect.

The teachers Kentucky are a piece of a far larger issue reflecting state-wide pensions and local politicians being politicians. The moronic decision to allow a religious theme park tax breaks to help the commonwealth was a sign to Kentuckians who voted blindly. 

&gt;    The budget passed by the Kentucky legislature on Monday night would increase per-pupil student funding to $4,000, up from the current $3,981. But that's still below pre-recession levels once adjusted for inflation.

Note the above figure, Annie, and consider how that reflects a state‚Äôs worth of educators. It is obvious you are not an educator, as teachers all over are NOT simply trying to get money for themselves. 

It is per-student-funding, Annie. Teachers paying for classroom materials out of their own pocket may be alright by you, but THAT type of lethargic attentiveness is why this problem exists currently. Do you pay to work at your job? Can you afford to pay to work at your job? Teachers cannot - but do so anyhow. In Shelby County, Kentucky I personally know teachers who have spent over a thousand dollars per semester.   

Please Annie, share where you acquired your regard to teachers not caring about their fellow pensioners? And, it seems you know the sheer volume of state pensioners in Kentucky? It may behoove you to read a little before helping yourself appear ignorant unnecessarily.

So....per-student-funding. 

$3,981 up to $4,000....that is a lot per student, right?
Well..

&gt;    U.S. states' education spending averaged $10,700 per pupil in 2013, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, but that average masked a wide variation, ranging from $6,555 per pupil in Utah to $19,818 in New York.

Note that said 2013.
Annie, governors and lawmakers are not the only persons culpable. Voters, and even flawed and ignorantly shared opinions do plenty of damage in their own right.

But they go to work at the school everyday, they lead classrooms, they grade papers. When the students say ""teacher"", he turns and give them attention. He never corrects them. He might never call himself ""teacher"", but says he's an educator, he's sent by the principle. The school pays him. He parks in the teacher's spots in the parking lot. He eats in the teacher's lounge and talks to the other teachers. Say some student then says ""you know, I've never heard him call himself a teacher explicitly. I'm going to just refuse to listen to instructions, stop doing my homework and when I get a failing grade, I'll just claim that he never called him a teacher explicitly."" The other students would think that he's absolutely nuts. 

Jesus may never say ""hey everyone, just wanted to let the cat out of the bag: I'm God"" but the reason when he said ""before Abraham was, I AM"" made the Jews of his time so angry is because they knew he was referring to Yahweh's self-title given when he spoke to Moses from the burning bush. He forgave sins. He said he was the Lord of the Sabbath. He received worship. He says he's to be prayed to. He says that all judgment is given to him. That he's one with the Father.

Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Josh Axe, Eric Berg, Thomas DeLauer, ihealthtube.com, nutritionfacts.org, (all YouTube channels) are people I listen to for good information that can help you understand natural health benefits of food especially anti inflammatory food. 

I'd be happy to share all the information I have. Whether that be what I eat, how I work out, the ingredients for my Nutribullets and why I choose them. I don't care. If you want to talk about it let's talk about it and hopefully you're reading this and have been wanting to make a change and now I think is the time to do it. I don't want you to take my word on anything. At the end go check out the research that has been done and see the life transforming power of food as medicine.

The way people view wealth as a stack of food/water/construction material/etc. hidden in a warehouse somewhere that could be used for good is extremely misinformed and misleading. I assure you that billionaires don't have stacks of concrete material hidden somewhere. Less than 5% of GDP is from raw material. Most of the wealth comes from creative activities. Billionaires don't have a stack of billions of cash. They have enterprises that enable people to work, to produce, and to exchange.

Dump statement. Stupid ad hominem. None of us are Valve employees, so at best we are ALL speculating. Unless you are a valve developer, don't make statements like this. From here on out we will understand that we are all speculating unless facts are presented. Thank you. Also I know as much about WC3 Dota as the next person. Thank you very much.


&gt; Shallow grave is triggered heal....

Quote from the skill's description. ""The target is kept alive by having its minimum health set to 1."" This is not healing. It literally is stopping you from going below 1 by setting 1 as your minimum and stopping you from takign damage beyond that. More accurately you could have just said ""discussion is about wc3 dota"" (see last section). To which I would say ""oh yea, triggered heals were a thing then""

&gt; Second, you ignore the fact you CAN'T use HP Removal for lethal instance of damage, it just makes units suicide.

False, you can kill with hp removal UNLESS prevented by interaction. Experiment for you: go get life drained by Pugna.

&gt; Do you really believe that would be intended that whenever you cull/reap/shatter someone, you get NO kill credit?

False again. I clearly stated that Hp manipulation is counted. Experiment for you: Again life drain since it is the simplest hp manipulator in the game with minimal interactions. You play Pugna and life drain peeps. Experiment 2: Go sunder people with TB.

&gt; Third, you make for a bad game dev, no offense. You fail to account for things like Dispersion or Bristleback, as they reduce all damage types, so your version of Culling Blade wouldn't instakill at the same health threshold as any other unit.

First statement, stupid ad hominem again. Secondly, I DID consider those spells and my statements were made based on culling blade the spell. It can be speculated that culling blade is meant as a killing tool. It is not balanced around the damage in the non-kill instance. It is balanced around its threshold in the kill instance. As such, it makes MOST sense for the devs to make it Pure damage, hp removal for easy coding. Dispersion DOES NOT reduce culling blade in the kill scenario. Bristleback DOES NOT reduce culling blade in the kill scenario. Why? Pure damage hp removal. Reduction is only considered for the non-kill scenario which does a fixed amount of damage.

&gt; Also, since it's physical damage, ...

The spell's description clearly states it's pure damage. Not sure why you are still hung up on physical. Unless you want to go tell Valve they are wrong. 

&gt; it also purges you in order to get rid of potential ethereal

This makes no sense. The ability to purge has nothing to do with damage. That's just a property of the spell that was added in 6.72d. As counter points, diffusal blades active is a purge that does no damage. Razor's unstable current is a purge that does magical damage. Physical damage, no damage or magical damage. None of this have anything to do with the ability to purge.


&gt; And last, where the fuck did you get this from?

Description of the spell. Unless again you want to go tell valve they are wrong.

&gt; it wouldn't disable Blink Dagger, for instance, otherwise, and such a damage type just doesn't exist in WC3 DotA.

This makes no sense. HP removal is a damage. Just not one of the normal 3. As a damage it will block blink dagger. The only documented caveat is that hp removal will not interact with consumables. Eg. cancelling salve. Also wrong, Hp removal WAS present in WC3 Dota. It just couldn't kill. I remember that cause no end to bugs involving Lanaya's refraction. They ""fixed"" it in Dota 2 by allowing hp removal to kill.

&gt; Terroblade might get credit in Dota 2, but even if he does, he can't kill with it directly, so that's not relevant at all,

It is relevant because you said in the previous post ""In order to give credit for damage and kills, you have to deal real damage instead of manipulating health."". I said nothing about TB killing with Sunder. I said he gets damage credit. Making this statement false.

&gt; especially in the game in question, WC3 DotA. Stay on topic, will ya?

Literally the only thing of relevance. I admitted to not seeing the (1) in brackets when I responded. The OP civilly pointed this out and I civilly accepted. You on the other hand jumped in and spat nonsense everywhere instead of a simple ""oh that was an interaction in WC3 Dota"" to which I would have said ""Oh yea I missed the (1) in the OP's initial statement as that would make valid some of the things discussed"".

Enunwa @ CLE

Cooper @ MIA

Hogan @ DET

Cole @ TEN

Honestly, I was feeling pretty great about my golden-waiver-goose Enunwa after the morning slate of games. 7rec for 90+ yards is awesome to have any day. And then Cooper, Hogan, and Cole all outscored him. Granted, Enunwa was wide open in the endzone and Darnold missed him, and he would have easily had the highest score had that touchdown been converted. Cole looked flat out electric against the Pats, Cooper (however frustrating) is still the receiver to own in what should be a solid offense and Hogan has Brady tossing him dimes.

As far as downsides, I feel if Fournette plays, Cole's ceiling is capped significantly, which is a shame, because he's a damn playmaker. To be honest I'm hoping Hogan has a bonkers game this week so I can trade him with Edelman returning; Hogan's targets will diminish some in the coming weeks. Cooper feels like he's gonna bust any given week, but he's possibly the most talented of the receivers that I have with the highest upside, and I feel like Enunwa is possibly capped by uncertain QB play; jury is still out on Darnold who had a solid debut but fell back to earth this week.

I still think I'm leaning Enunwa overall simply for guaranteed volume but some of these matchups are pretty sweet. Alternatively, I could add one of them into the FLEX spot where Drake currently sits (vs. OAK). But I'd like to get some advice."	I meant from a fantasy perspective specifically.

Granted, there are some miserable people who don't tip well at all.  I refuse to go out with a group of people at my LGS after seeing them each tip $1-2 on tabs that were $20 each.  I actually ended up doubling my tip to make up for that bs (And I already tip well above average). 


The problem is that tipping allows menu prices to be cheap, even if the entire tab is the same or even lower.  This has a bit of psychological impact on people, as Americans have a pretty ingrained sense of bargain shopping.

Education and relocation expenses are candidates for the ""good"". Education has spillover effects; individuals left to bear the full cost would under-consume. This is skewed in the US however, since so much education is subsidized through means other than income taxation. Relocation also has societal benefits and externalities realized beyond the individual. A more mobile workforce is more flexible; as well it allows for easier adaptation to geographical changes. But again, this particular case is undercut by simultaneously subsidizing individuals to purchase homes at leverage (and we're back to the mortgage interest deduction).

There are other candidates: charitable donations, job search costs, &amp; energy tax credit come to mind. Basically any case with spillover effects and positive externalities.

I think the first part of your criticism is subjective. Some people do enjoy watching gameplay videos than playing the game themselves. Which is totally cool. I'm really interested in why you found Shadow of the Colossus hard to get through.

When you say that you found the controls atrocious, do you mean the key bindings weren't ideal or is it more about the overall way you control the character or agro?

Personally I felt that bow aiming was a bit wonky. Mainly because it uses just one button for drawing and releasing and the way you moved the bow crosshair was tough to control with just one analog stick.

You talk about seeing someone who looks like he's undeserving getting payouts, and you conclude that it's right we should have a clampdown on them. Fair enough. But the thing is, the DWP isn't really clamping down on them at all.

You see, the DWP doesn't really care that much about fraud. Fraud rates are below 1%, and professional fraudsters make it their business to keep track of what's going on and stay ahead of the game. With the DWP under so much pressure to cut costs, clamping down on fraud would be a waste of effort. They need low-hanging fruit.

Oh, by the way, if you check official DWP figures, fraud rates have risen and are now somewhere above 1%.

"A financial asset's present value is usually the discounted value of future cashflows/growth. E.g. An office block's value is the future net rental cashflow's 'discounted' back at the investors required rate of return. Investors may asign different values to the same asset as they are using different required rate of returns or use different assumptions; mortgage costs, repair costs, vacancy etc.

The same can be used for stocks by estimated the future value of growth or dividends.

Bonds are the easiest as they are very simply valued based on their known cashflows (coupons) and redemption value (principle).

2717	"Hi. I'm a 40yo Latino under educated freelance artist trying to take care of my family, 7 month pregnant wife and 9yo kid, and I haven't been able to catch a break for the last couple of years. Been married for 10 years and 5 years ago I moved to Asia to a country I don't speak the language with only 2k dollars. I wasn't able to get a resident Visa until 3 years after we came. My wife, a native, can't keep a job more than a month and she have only tried twice. Today the 7th of January, I have 35 dollars cash, my PayPal account is -150 dlls for almost a month and I haven't paid this month rent yet. My wife decided to get into ""air"" college 6 months ago even tho I begged her to wait until after the pregnancy but her mother offered to pay for it (250 dlls) to or surprise when the actual tuition was 600 dlls and her mom took her money back. Last 2 times we went to buy food for the week we maxed our credit card. We live in the country side and we go to a tiny Mormon church (I just go back to my car to sleep since I work at nights mostly) anyways. Missionaries contacted a pregnant lady in our area, she is only 24ish years old and she is pregnant for like 2 months. She asked to missionaries to bring her food but they don't do that. Her family don't live on this town but her husband send her the minimum amount of 300 dlls a month. She is a local, not an immigrant. Local people here are usually wealthy, and she have family. Yesterday I didn't even had money to buy drinking water. My wife offered to cook for her and get her food from our pocket. I'm really pissed, but also guilty for that reason. I think I'm a huge asshole."	"Nah, you're not an asshole. You were rightfully mad and you did something harmless to express it, sure you're not a paragon of godly grace and maturity but nobody really is. The homeless dude was a dick, and speaking as someone who's been homeless more often than not for a while and dealt with plenty of homeless people with mental issues, someone who's with it enough to ask you a favor should be with it enough to not be rude about tomatoes on the damn food. Bitching awkwardly about it for a moment, maybe, that's not that weird a lashing-out for someone mentally ill to do, but throwing the food down and wasting it? Fuck that guy. Hopefully he regrets the shit out of it. (Actually tbh I wouldn't be surprised if it was a display he promptly regretted and if he picked up the non-tomato pieces to still eat after you left ...

Mid-game, your build is mostly done, there are no real gear surprises coming. You speedily run, jump, or teleport from elite pack to elite pack &amp; annihilate them on a difficulty that is quick &amp; efficient to farm. You gather tons of items by the bucketload just to salvage them all at once without looking at them and work on rerolling/reforging your existing items until you have all the right stats.      
  
Late game, your build was done long ago and you're just getting tiny tiny upgrades and paragon levels and gem levels. You slog carefully through high GRs, dodge every enemy attack, and use AoE to burst down your carefully shepherded packs. If you're not focused on getting somewhere on the leaderboards you should probably find some other goal for yourself.

besides that, there has indeed been change.   
pity the morons running the show have no idea why.   
a decade of no changes is a real problem, basically because kids are now taught in a naplan year how to pass, not how to spell or add. the tuition is centred on purely getting the school a good result in naplan because the schools are held responsible for bad results.   
think about that for a second.   
kids are being trained to pass a specific test, and despite this, they are still doing no better.   
its like saying instead of teaching you maths, we are only testing you can add up correctly, so we are only going to teach you to add up, and they still can't lift results despite that.

2756	"&gt; I don't think that's necessarily true / maybe it depends on where you live?

In many ways it is true, but it does *also* depend on where you live. 

For example, if you live in the Bay Area, there are lots of *options* to be incrementally more environmentally friendly as an individual. Every service you could ask for (and probably your workplace) are within easy reach of the relatively good public transportation. If you do need a car, there's no end to the available EV charging locations, and EVs get perks on the highways. Most of the municipalities in the Bay offer good recycling programs, electricity savings programs, etc. California as a whole has mandated environmentally friendly bags for shopping, and tons of people use reusable bags. So on and so forth.

But if you live in a rural area, you won't have very good (if any) public transportation, you won't likely have many options for electrical/hybrid vehicles, environmentally friendly programs will be of significantly smaller scale (if they even exist), etc. So it would be hard to do much individually even if you wanted to.

That said, it doesn't make a very significant difference either way. The vast majority of waste, electricity usage, fossil fuel usage, and especially emissions come from corporate/industrial use, not individuals. Last I saw for emissions the number was something like &lt;5-10% of emissions come from the combined total of **every** activity by **every** individual combined (in the US). This includes every mile driven by someone in their gas-guzzling cars. I could be off, but the scale is in the ballpark. With such ridiculously unbalanced scales, there's hardly any difference individuals can make even if they *do* try. It needs to come from the big corporations/entire industries/government/etc. before individual people can even start trying to help."

As I recall, WA voted against federating (several times) and NZ voted for federating, so perhaps that‚Äôs where the confusion arises. "	"This needs to be made clear as there is so much misinformation out there.

&amp;#x200B;

The STATES primarily fund public schools. More than 80% of their funding as it stands comes from the States and they have control and responsibility over public schools. This is a fact and is written in legislation.

&amp;#x200B;

It used to be that States funded their public schools fully, but they did such a poor job the Commonwealth (Federal) had to intervene. This is why they provide a small amount to public schools, however as stated above, public schools are primarily funded and are the full responsibility of the STATES.

&amp;#x200B;

If your local public school is suffering, this is not an issue with Federal funding, it is an issue with your State Government.

&amp;#x200B;

Be careful taking sides with certain parties with thoughts such as ""Damn Liberals screwing my public schools again"" as you will find that currently in Victoria it is held by Labor, and they are responsible right now for the poor public schools in that state. Western Australia is held by Labor. Queensland is held by Labor. ACT is held by Labor.

&amp;#x200B;

Labor also introduced Gonski 1.0 which gave record levels of funding to Private schools, particularly the wealthy ones, and the Liberal's Gonski 2.0, for all its criticism, actually reduced it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not supporting Liberals just merely stating that both sides are just as bad as each other, and what you think the Liberals are responsible for may actually be something Labor did, and what you think the Commonwealth is responsible for may actually be the States fault."	australia	australia	-1
2759	"&gt; A jar of pennies has an even or an odd number of pennies, however:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Do I believe it's even? No.
&gt; 
&gt; Do I believe it's odd? No.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Theists are claiming the jar has an even number of pennies and atheists say we do not believe their claim. It is up to the theist to demonstrate his claim that there is in fact an even number of pennies.

Your example (and some others gave similar examples) is irrelevant as it is.

Let us make it relevant:

Two missing elements in your example are as follows:

1. Burden of proof in an example corresponding to God must relate to an consequence. If there is 0 implication of being right or wrong, we cannot speak of burden of proof. In case of God, there are many claimed consequences of being right or wrong, like hell, being ungrateful, irrational for not seeing possible evidences... If the claim of God is true, then those consequences also will be true. If there is no consequence of being right or wrong, there will be no real burden of anything.

2. The proofs or evidences must be accessible. If these are not accessible, then we cannot talk of the burden of proof, since it will never be known whether what is proven is true or not.

So;

Suppose that you are in a contest as a team of two partners.

The question is: Is the number of pennies in the jar in front of each of you odd or even? (Let us omit the weight of the jar for simplicity, and assume that you cannot count the pennies, but there are some data by which you can find the answer or not.) There are three buttons for each of you: 1. Odd 2. Even 3. No evidence seen/no answer/ (not convinced). At that stage, if both of you give the correct answer you get USD10.000, if one gives correct and the other wrong answer, you get 1.000, if one gives correct answer, the other is unconvinced, you get 2.000. If both gives ""no evidence"", then you get 200. If none gives correct answer, then you get nothing. (The amounts are total for the team, and you share the result among you.)

Each of you have exactly same jar, same amount of pennies, and same mechanism.

You start, and your friend finds the answer first. After a while he presses the ""odd"" button and says, ""It is odd, press that button"". You ask why? He says, ""because I discovered evidence for a mechanism where for any odd number of pennies, the electrical circuit is closed and the lamp is on. And accordingly when I put the jar on the mechanism, the lamp is on. So press also the ""Odd"" button. You say, ""I am not convinced"". He says ""Why not, do what I did and you will see""? You say ""You did not fulfill your burden of proof, you came with a claim, so you have to convince me, and I am not convinced and I do not have the burden of proof to show you the opposite, and I will just press 'not convinced button' and this button does not require any burden of proof.""

(In a second scenario, you agree to look at his evidence, but you are not convinced, and you say ""I am not convinced that there is an evidence for your claim, so I will press the unconvinced button"", he says ""prove me that my evidence is invalid, so that I also press that button instead of pressing the wrong button"". Though you have time, you say ""I make no claim, so I do not have any burden of proof, and I do not need to explain anything.""

Atheists' position is very similar to the second person in this adjusted example rather than your initial example."	"That was one of the questions that started my deconversion process.

That said, I still stand by the original point that especially regarding drug legislation that there certainly seemed to be if not racial bias at the very least racial consequence:

Sentencing disparities

In 1986, the U.S. Congress passed laws that created a 100 to 1 sentencing disparity for the trafficking or possession of crack when compared to penalties for trafficking of powder cocaine,[71][72][73][74] which had been widely criticized as discriminatory against minorities, mostly blacks, who were more likely to use crack than powder cocaine.[75] This 100:1 ratio had been required under federal law since 1986.[76] Persons convicted in federal court of possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine received a minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years in federal prison. On the other hand, possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine carries the same sentence.[72][73] In 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act cut the sentencing disparity to 18:1.[75]

According to Human Rights Watch, crime statistics show that‚Äîin the United States in 1999‚Äîcompared to non-minorities, African Americans were far more likely to be arrested for drug crimes, and received much stiffer penalties and sentences.[77]

Statistics from 1998 show that there were wide racial disparities in arrests, prosecutions, sentencing and deaths. African-American drug users made up for 35% of drug arrests, 55% of convictions, and 74% of people sent to prison for drug possession crimes.[72] Nationwide African-Americans were sent to state prisons for drug offenses 13 times more often than other races,[78] even though they only supposedly comprised 13% of regular drug users.[72]"	I agree. But this is still a discussion (the ban and other solutions) we need to have because I think we all agree we want less gun violence even if it's only one less death.	canada	canada	-1

At the same time however, I'm less irritable about some things - I might think you're wrong but get how you personally probably got there and feel better than I used to, and that's had the effect of tempering irritation if the ""how could you be so stupid to think that"" that an angry young me had about a lot of things not even related to the topic at hand necessarily.

As for the philosophical arguments I guess you could say my perception of their value is different - I think they can be useful jumping off points to look into something - a logical manner to form a hypothesis to be tested - but are themselves proof of nothing. Often times in my current profession (programming) perfectly logical trains of thought will work exactly as expected, but sometimes you'll come up with a theory that makes a great deal of sense and is supported by some evidence but turns out totally wrong when actually put to the test.

This actually ties well into your statements about recognizing fallibility - in both cases I recognize people, including myself, are fallible and not all knowing, so things such as philosophical arguments and anecdotes that cannot be put to the test aren't by themselves useful for determining factual information, just good starting points to try to gather said information."

Secondly, I will say that the Qur'an is a unreliable source. It contains many conradictions and plagiarisms within its own base religious foundations. For example, it states that the first Moslem was either Mohammed, Moses, a group of Egyptians, or¬† Abraham in four separate verses. While the bible also contains contradictions, these are generally minor and do not interfere with the moral teaching or foundation of Christianity or Judaism. Furthermore, the Bible is historically reliable, as stated by the Smithsonian Department of Anthropology and the National Geographic Society. The Qur'an was also only witnessed by Mohammed, whereas the Bible has many different authors and sources; it is much more likely that one man created his own religion and holy book rather than the very many sources from which the Bible is comprised. 
I am not capable of condemning anyone. I cannot say with any kind of certainty that anyone is going to heaven or Hell.¬† I believe that the only judge is God.

Moral culpability can be lessened by habit, influence by society, and how you grew up. If my faith was disproved and I found that I was not following the truth, I would convert on the spot. As of yet, this has not happened. Most importantly, I believe that if someone truly wants to know truth, they will find it."	"&gt; It doesn't matter if they were profoundly Christian when their reasons and motivations were secular.

Yes it does matter. It shows that profound Christianity doesn't stop people to fight horrific wars. During WWI the Germans had the parole ""Gott mit uns"" (""God with us"") in their heraldry and written on the coupling-straps of the soldier's uniforms. And each county had its variant: the English ""God with us"", the French ""Dieu et mon droit"", the Russians *–°—ä –Ω–∞–º–∏ –ë–æ–≥—ä!* - ""S nami Bog!"" (""With us god!""). During wars at the beginning of each raid short prayers were done. ""God with us"" was yelled over centuries in all regional languages all over the continent when a battle took off.

It shows that religion motivates warfare and that it makes no difference whether a nation is religious or less religious.

&gt; Most violence and atrocities that occurred in the Age of Enlightenment onward were non-religious, anti-religious and atheistic, and indisputably much more heinous than the religious atrocities in the Middle Ages.

This IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I provided you a link to a list of wars fought in Europe since the Middle Ages. REALLY read through that list and notice how your contentions are falsified.

I wrote that most conflicts are about nationalism and tribalism. So were WWI and WWII. Nationalism and tribalism as such have *nothing* to do with atheism or secularism.

Thirdly, why conflicts take ever greater death tolls in modern times is due to advancing warfare technology and internationalization. In the ME there simply was no technology to slaughter 100,000 people in a few days. There even were no logistical means to fight wars over a whole continent. Also the population numbers were low. In 1200 Europe counted ~100 million inhabitants, that's about the population of Germany and the Netherlands combined today. Even throwing an atom bomb would have taken a death toll far less than it would today.

But advanced warfare technology and smaller populations have *nothing* to do with any *motive* for those conflicts. Moreover, cruelty is not only measured in numbers of casualties. It is also established by the *ways* atrocities are committed. So you think that the ME were less cruel? You really should read [this book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sword-Fire-Atrocity-Medieval-Paperbacks/dp/0304366951) by historian Sean McGlinn (*By Sword and Fire: Cruelty And Atrocity In Medieval Warfare: The Savage Reality of Medieval Warfare*). For your convenience here's the Amazon abstract:

&gt; Sean McGlynn investigates the reality of medieval warfare. For all the talk of chivalry, medieval warfare routinely involved acts which we would consider war crimes. Lands laid waste, civilians slaughtered, prisoners massacred: this was standard fare justified by tradition and practical military necessity. It was unbelievably barbaric, but seldom uncontrolled. Such acts of atrocity were calculated, hideous cruelties inflicted in order to achieve a specific end. Sean McGlynn examines the battles of Acre and Agincourt, sieges like B√©ziers, Lincoln, Jerusalem and Limoges as well as the infamous chevauch√©es of the Hundred Years War that devastated great swathes of France. He reveals how these grisly affairs form the origin of accepted 'rules of war', codes of conduct that are today being enforced in the International Court of Justice in the Hague.

A little example by me: the siege of B√©ziers. As you know, the crusades were religious wars. Not many people know that crusades were not only ordered by the pope to fight Islam in the Holy Land. They also were issued against religious minorities within Europe itself. For instance, the Albigensian Crusade was ordered in the early 13th century by pope Innocent III (what's in a name...) to eliminate Catharism in the Languedoc, In 1209 the city of B√©ziers was besieged because it was known to be a stronghold of Catharism. When the city's defences collapsed, Arnaud Amalric, Abbot of Citeaux, who commanded the crusade army, asked what to do with its inhabitants that still were Catholic. The pope answered: ""Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius"", which means: ""Kill them all because the Lord knows those who are His own."" Consequently the whole city was sacked, all inhabitants were killed, irrespective age, sex or religious affinity. Arnaud was so kind to write it down neatly in a letter to the pope in august 1209:

&gt;  While discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders. To our amazement, crying ""to arms, to arms!"", within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and B√©ziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and burnt.

Gee, it reads as one of the massacres of the OT.

&gt; The genocides in communist Europe was atheistic.

You REALLY mustn't distort history all the time. Here is a short summary of what actually happened, let's take the rule of Stalin, the most notorious of Soviet regimes (there's not much agreement about the exact number, so I merely take the uppermost estimates):

1. the very most victims of Stalin were the 1932-33 famines due to idiotic reorganization, collectivisation and mismanagement of the agricultural sector as well as reinforced resettlements of the kulaks (farmers) - 6-7 million deaths. Also natural causes count, especially draught and plant diseases. The 1930-33 famine was preceded by many other, similar famines during the whole history of Russia and weren't confined to the Communist era. But at least part of these deaths was an unintended effect of Communist policy (but yet, evidently, communism can be held responsible for that). 

2. direct killing of people: 6-9 million people (most historians estimate it to be less though, after the collapse of the Soviet union, when official Russian records became available, the numbers are revised downwards, most likely according to current estimates some 3-5 million people). Most of those killed were political opponents of the Bolsheviks. The ones killed for their religious affinity were many but still a minority.

So the vast majority of massacres by Communism had nothing to do with their atheism. So I could argue like you and say ""doesn't matter if they were profoundly atheist"" but I won't make that mistake myself. Also here the correct conclusion would be: apparently atheism doesn't stop people to kill. Like religion doesn't stop people to kill. It's relevant to observe how profound Christian nations fought hundreds of wars during the post-Roman history of Europe.

&gt; The Holocaust was pseudoscientific

The Holocaust was WHAT?

Above all, the Holocaust was a disaster rooted in anti-Semitism that haunted Europe as long as Christianity ruled the continent. It is deeply rooted in Christianity. It was implemented by a profound Christian nation and instigated by the Nazis, which all were raised Christians. Hitler himself referred to ""the Almighty"" in many of his infamous speeches as well as his ""Mein Kampf"", well up to the last years of WWII, *especially* when he referred to the ""Jewish problem"". Anti-Semitism was vibrant during the last decades of the 19th century well up to the 1940s and German Nazism only was merely a continuation and culmination of it. Look up ""Dreyfuss affair"".

Hitler was very fond of Luther - yes *that* guy, the founder of Protestantism - and called him the greatest German of all times. And he liked him because of Luther's virulent and maddened anti-Semitism. Luther wrote several works on the Jewish problem: *Von den Juden und Ihren L√ºgen* (""On the Jews and Their Lies"") and *Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi* (""Of the Unknowable Name and the Generation of Christ""), the most important ones. The former already scored 5 reprints during Luther's life. It apparently was a very popular work in those days. Let's have a quote from that book:

&gt; First, to set fire to their synagogues or schools ‚Ä¶ This is to be done in honor of our Lord and of Christendom, so that God might see that we are Christians.

&gt; Second, I advise that their houses also be razed and destroyed.

&gt; Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudic writings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught, be taken from them.

&gt; Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain of loss of life and limb.

&gt; Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways be abolished completely for the Jews. For they have no business in the countryside.

&gt; Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited to them, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them.

&gt; Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an ax, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or a spindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earn their bread in the sweat of their brow ‚Ä¶ But if we are afraid that they might harm us or our wives, children, servants, cattle, etc., ‚Ä¶ then let us emulate the common sense of other nations such as France, Spain, Bohemia, etc., ‚Ä¶ then eject them forever from the country.

It almost reads as written by the Nazis themselves during the Wannsee conference.

Moreover, many Nazis, especially the highly ranked, tended to disengaged themselves from Christianity but as an alternative engulfed themselves in occultism of all sorts. Also not quite an atheist thing.

Historian Daniel Goldhagen wrote 2 important books: *Hitler‚Äôs Willing Executioners*, about the greediness of the German people in participating in Hitler's policies and *A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Church in the Holocaust and Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair*. So at least we may conclude that the role the Catholic and Protestant churches played during the Holocaust was dubious at least."	DebateReligion	DebateReligion	-1

2885	"&gt;higher reproductive fitness causes higher future population. So evolution simply cannot favor a result that impairs reproductive fitness.

I'd suggest that the raw numbers of births in and of itself (""higher future population"") is not necessarily a predictor of how successful a species will be. It's required that these young also reproduce, or the passing of genes hasn't truly been successful, at least where long term survival is concerned.

&amp;#x200B;

A real world example would be my local deer population which regularly out breeds its resources, ultimately causing many of its members to die of starvation, run out of habitat, suffer from disease, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

They're very successful at creating more deer in the short term, perhaps like these areas of humanity where women are oppressed, but that ability to crank out young turns out to be detrimental to their ultimate growth and long term survival. Annual hunts are organized to reduce population, a literal 'thinning of the herd', which is beneficial for overall population growth and health. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in your scenario I suppose it would depend on whether or not those higher birth rates are ultimately a benefit or detriment to the population overall, over time. Birth rate alone is not a guarantee for a successful species. 

&amp;#x200B;

Consider in your scenario, where we only take into account birth rate as 'success'. That \*seems\* to indicate that their is no top end that would be ideal, that continued population growth without end is desirable for a species' health. But that's not the case. You can quickly see where that would be an issue for any species. Balance is key ultimately. Imagine this planet with 500 billion humans on it...I think natural selection would deal with us handily. Unchecked growth isn't healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

'Thoughtful' breeding, as it were, deliberately curtailing our reproduction rates, may ultimately be the right choice for the health of the species."

He plays off his backhand a lot, which is going to give the puck to a LW more often than not, whether it's off a pass or rebound. Looking at guys he's had good chemistry with in the past is a long list of LWs: Sheary, Neal, Kunitz, Dupuis, Marchand (in international play), etc. Hornqvist is a pretty good RW match for Crosby because he crashes the net to try and knock in some greasy goals.

"Unexpected excess load will have to sold for negative dollars. 

If the power grid is consistently producing more than is needed, that could be accounted for by increasing export... but export requires huge infrastructure. North America has 4 discrete synchronous grids. Transporting energy between these grids can only happen by first converting it to high voltage direct current. This is some expensive infrastructure. There are high voltage interconnects between grids, but new ones don't just get built on the drop of a dime because one grid produces more energy than it needs to... that should have been planned for so they would be built as the grid's output is built up.

In the short term it would probably be more economical to reduce output--get rid of some solar panels, or retire a baseload power station. But the trouble there is that might require more power from ""flexible"" sources--which is both dirtier and more expensive."	askscience	askscience	-1

2907	"Hello!
A friend of mine (30m) and I (23f) are considering going to Iceland via WOW airlines in January. January 2019 is optimal for both of us because he has no one to complete with for time off work, and I do not have school for all of that month. Iceland has been on both of our bucket lists for a while, a WOW's offer of a round trip flight to Reykjavik for less than 500 a piece is hard to resist.

We are considering exploring some of the more rural parts of Iceland (northwest) and are seriously considering renting a car (one built to withstand possible snowy/icy roads at that, possibly a Suzuki Cross or similar car). We both come from the American midwest and have experience with winter driving. We are also both able to drive manual, but will almost certainly invest the extra money for an automatic. Would committing to a 3 hour drive out of the Reykjavik area in January (assuming we have GPS, fuel, extra food/water, and the expected supplies) be irresponsible? I love road trips and am perfectly happy being behind the wheel, even in not optimal conditions, but I don't want to be naive. Any time we spend in Reykjavik, however, we may rely on public transit.

With limited daily hours of sunlight, what kind of activities or places would you recommend  before 11:00 and after 17:00? We enjoy art, music, theater, museums, culture in general, some nightlife, nature, hiking, swimming, thermal/hot springs, sauna... much of anything, really. We aren't super into sports, though we are open minded about it.

And, on another note, how LGBT friendly is Iceland? My friend is married to another man, and even though I am in a committed relationship with a guy, I am pansexual and very involved with the queer community. We can easily pass as a straight couple when we can't be open about our orientations since neither of us really come across as stereotypically ""gay,"" though Iceland does strike me as fairly progressive.  However, I am curious as to how active the LGBT scene is throughout the country. 

Sorry for the rambling post. Thank you in advance!"	"Rick Steves' are full of great tips. I also like the DK travel ""top ten"" ones for planning an itinerary.

I do think them straight up announcing it is a new game is significant though, and typically when Blizzard talks about their game development history, you always hear they started working on it immediately after releasing the previous iteration with a very small team initially. This can happen even when expansions are still in the works for the previous game.

Whatever they have is very likely to have 4\+ years of work on it, but with Overwatch release a couple years ago, the Diablo team probably grew very large. Also, D3 was announced in June, not at Blizzcon, we could even see something very soon, but that is wishful thinking.

I wouldn't be too surprised though if they announce a D2 remaster, people get hyped, but then at the end of the panel, they drop the D4 announcement. D2 remaster to hold people over until the actual release of D4 would be very strategical move.

**Grounds tunes in to Quintet Partners**

UBS boss Matt Grounds may be lamenting the loss of billionaire gaming mogul James Packer as an exclusive, high-maintenance client of the Swiss bank. But life goes on for the millionaire ¬≠banker.

Alongside his UBS corporate advisory practice, the Mosman-based Grounds, who turns 50 next year, is pursuing a gaggle of investment side projects: in aged care (with former UBS banker David Di Pilla), in commercial real estate (with property tragic Tim Church and an assortment of UBS‚Äôs richest Australian employees) and in tech start-ups like Data Republic.

His latest capital commitment is to fledgling private equity outfit Quintet Partners. The Sydney-based outfit was founded early last year by Douglas Farrell, the former head of mergers and acquisitions and real estate investment banking for Citigroup in Australia and New Zealand.

Quintet provides sweet connections for Grounds, who is a shareholder along with his wife Kimberly Grounds.

Farrell‚Äôs fellow director is lawyer-turned-private equiteer Tim Gonski, 26, who before joining Quintet was an M&amp;A lawyer specialising in private equity at Herbert Smith Freehills.

Others might recognise Gonski as the son of ANZ chairman David Gonski, another Freehills alumni who set off into investment banking before tacking into his present career as the Chairman of Everything.

Quintet focuses on investments in small to mid-sized business in Australia and NZ with enterprise values between $20 million and $200m.

Last year, the fund made its maiden investment in financial services firm One Investment alongside former AMP boss Paul Batchelor‚Äôs Yorkway Partners.

As to be expected of such a well-connected operation, several private family offices supported Quinet‚Äôs investment.

Nothing to see here

Corporate regulator James Shipton‚Äôs ASIC minions were on to the Simon Rothery-led Goldman Sachs nice and early yesterday morning after the bank‚Äôs loyal service for their new trophy client James Packer.

Working for high-profile, high-maintenance billionaires can be tricky.

The corporate watchdog was seeking clarification over the bank‚Äôs dual equity market efforts for the gaming mogul Packer and his $6 billion listed casino empire Crown Resorts, which was flagged in Margin Call yesterday.

On Monday after the market closed, Goldies sold a $105 million parcel of Crown shares (about 1.2 per cent of the casino operator‚Äôs stock) for Packer‚Äôs private company Consolidated Press Holdings.

Earlier that day Crown told the market that Packer might sell some shares. In the same ASX announcement, Crown said it was getting on with the ordinary share buyback it had first announced in August, then postponed in December and ‚Äî surprise! ‚Äî this week decided to pull out of the bottom drawer.

To allay any concerns about Don Meij-style silly business, Crown added that a special committee of its independent directors ‚Äî whose numbers include former AFL boss Andrew Demetriou and private jet enthusiast Harold Mitchell ‚Äî would oversee the capital management program, which would also be carried out by Packer‚Äôs new bank of choice, Goldmans.

On Tuesday, after Margin Call was told the broker had done a block trade with Packer (and that where the billionaire‚Äôs stock ended up was a matter for the broker), we wondered to whom Goldies would sell Packer‚Äôs 8.24 million shares.

Shipton‚Äôs ASIC was similarly interested. After all, if Goldies sold the Packer stake into the buyback it would breach Corporations Law.

But everything‚Äôs kosher.

Goldies on Monday night immediately sold Packer‚Äôs $105m parcel to a clutch of about half a dozen instos, with the bank keen to point out the Goldies-led Crown buyback at that time had not yet commenced in the market.

So nothing to trouble the corporate cops. It‚Äôs just a case of clever investment banking.

Revealing CPH‚Äôs intention to sell down in the same announcement that resuscitated a more-than-six-month-old buyback was a cute way to calm investor concern about any share price impact from the proprietor‚Äôs selldown.

Here‚Äôs hoping Packer is paying the big bucks to his new friends at Goldies.

Car case hits top gear

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles‚Äô humiliation Down Under has finally made it to the High Court in London.

Margin Call can reveal FCA Australia‚Äôs case against Motortrak is presently being heard in the Rolls Building of London‚Äôs High Court of Justice.

The hearing is expected to run through to next week. So there‚Äôs plenty of time for the antipodean operations of the world‚Äôs eighth-biggest carmaker to further embarrass its chairman John Elkann, CEO Sergio Marchionne and, most pointedly, certain members of its global executive team.

Fiat Chrysler‚Äôs High Court appearance has its origins in the storied tenure of its former Australian boss Clyde Campbell.

The carmaker instructed lawyer Leon Zwier to pursue Campbell in a matter that ‚Äî after generating some incredible headlines ‚Äî was settled out of court in 2016.

Readers might remember that Campbell was accused by FCA of misappropriating and misusing more than $30m of the company‚Äôs money on, among other things, a $400,000 yacht, a plane and luxury villas at James Packer‚Äôs Crown Casino.

And then there was the more than $20m FCA alleged Campbell paid to Motortrak, a business owned by Campbell‚Äôs sometime golf buddy Gary Pask and star of the current High Court case in London.

Motortrak made websites for the FCA‚Äôs dealer network for which FCA has alleged it was billed extravagantly.

We‚Äôll find out shortly how Pask responds to those claims.

That‚Äôs my girl ...

Imitation is the highest form of flattery, but it isn‚Äôt always appreciated.

Just have a look at American sportswear giant Nike‚Äôs multi-million-dollar ‚ÄúNothing Beats a Londoner‚Äù campaign.

Nike‚Äôs LDNR branding was remarkably similar (putting aside the odd Nike Swoosh) to that of fledgling London athleisure wear brand LNDR, which happens to be run by Joanna Turner, the daughter of Flight Centre richie Graham ‚ÄúSkroo‚Äù Turner.

The 34-year-old launched the East London-based fashion start-up in 2015 with two mates to cater to London‚Äôs healthier, wealthier denizens.

Two years on and the LNDR brand is stocked in all the right places: Selfridges, Nordstrom, Le Bon Marche and online via the likes of Net-a-Porter.

When Turner and her business partners saw what Nike was up to with its lavish campaign celebrating the amateur and professional athletes of London ‚Äî with ads featuring track and field champ Mo Farah and footballers Harry Kane and Eden Hazard, plus hip-hop artists Skepta and AJ Tracey ‚Äî they went legal to right what they saw as a major commercial injustice.

And in London this week the trio won an injunction against the American sportswear giant. The judge has given Nike two weeks to remove all LDNR material. Just do it.

It‚Äôs not like the Turners weren‚Äôt equipped. By accountant John Stensholt‚Äôs calculations Skroo is on track for billionaire status and few doubt his fighting credentials. Like father, like daughter.

**And 2nd link:**

**Clyde Campbell lays low after settlement**

HALF a million bucks is chump change to our rich and famous. Which is why the peeps from Fiat Chrysler Automotives appeared to ‚Äús¬≠¬≠¬≠--- themselves‚Äù when it was revealed in the High Court in London this week that former head honcho Clyde Campbell settled with FCA for what the top end of town considers a derisory amount.

Former FCA boss Patrick Dougherty was asked by the barrister for Motortrak how he thought the FCA had a case against when it settled with Campbell for a minuscule ‚Äú$500,000‚Äù. It‚Äôs the first time the confidential payment has been revealed.

Campbell was accused by the FCA of misappropriating and misusing more than $30 million of the company‚Äôs money on, among other things, a $400,000 yacht, a plane and luxury villas at James Packer‚Äôs Crown casino.

The scandal hit Melbourne full throttle, with headlines linking Campbell to big-name celebrities such as Elizabeth Hurley, Shane Warne and Harry Kewell.

Campbell said he was not Snow White. ‚ÄúWhen I was young I got stuck in the wrong crowds,‚Äù he previously told Page 13 in his first interview following the settlement.

‚ÄúBut I remodelled myself over the course of 30-odd years. The people I thought would stand by me have. A few hangers-¬≠on have disappeared.‚Äù

Campbell and his wife Simone are keeping a low profile down at Brighton. Page 13 wonders if such a thing is possible.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a lawyer and I‚Äôve been a car salesman. If I go to a party, I‚Äôd rather talk to a car salesman. They‚Äôve got better jokes and they‚Äôre more fun,‚Äù Campbell said."	"I know they say that, but how can it be the case, really.

2934	Yea, this is hitting the point that I would say your clothing interferes with your ability to perform the job without a reasonable accommodation being possible.	"I'm a rape crisis counsellor and victim's advocate, so I can tell you what I tell others. 

Let him choose his own pathway, even if the choice goes against what you think is right (ie withdraws his statement from police.) sexual abuse is about removing people's control and safety, so the biggest rule of thumb is do everything the perpetrator did not. He lost the right to chose, the right to his body, the right to feel safe. So if he wants to do something stupid, your best play is to find the safest way to go through it. 

Normalise his feelings when he expresses something. It's normal to be all over the place, feel unsafe and unsure of your own sense of self and identity. Understand if it's what is needed for him, or your need to talk or not talk that might be getting in the way. Not unusual for men to not talk and find other ways to work through. Not unusual for them to get angry and aggressive as a means to ""run away,"" so be prepared for that, and try to know it's unlikely it's about you.

Counselling is not the answer to everyone, going to see a counsellor  too early can make things worse. Generally I'd say leave it 6 weeks, only worry about what coping strategies that persist after that time and that he views as a problem. People jump on the counselling wagon too early sometimes, and that can make things worse, not better. It's okay to use a crisis service to check in and get you through the rough times, but not everyone needs the full processing work with a counsellor. Some people can do that on their own. (esp. if they're well supported, and have no previous history of trauma... Though everyone responds so differently!) RAINN has some great online info and services if you're American. 

If you do go through court, use those victim advocacy/support services on offer and get them to talk you through the court processes and help liaise with police/courts. They have a different language and it is a soul destroying space. No one gets through it intact, and the victim's voice is easily lost. Get those professionals to do the heavy lifting for you.

Get yourself help. If you feel your partner needs support, but is refusing, it is great for helping you work through the emotions around it. If he discloses stuff about the assault, that can be so heavy to handle, having someone to talk to can help you be the best wife you can be (you already are, btw.) You can only help the ones you love through trauma if you've got your own shit together, and he'll need you. So please think of yourself. 

Good luck to you both, he is lucky to have you.

Of course I never mentioned it, she's a super cool person and that's all that mattered. After first year I didn't see her much, but she'd still come to our house parties and such over the years. Well about 1 year ago, she got serious about losing weight and she changed her lifestyle. So a couple weeks ago I was with my friends and one of them said ""Yoo look at [friend] these days!"" And he showed us her instagram and she looked like a completely different person! She had lost A LOT of weight. She wasn't skinny per se, but she was looking better then she ever has.

So last week I saw her snapchat story, she's been studying abroad for the last year. Seeing her story reminded me of that, so I messaged her to catch up. I told her that what I was gonna say was not me trying to be creepy at all. I just told her that she's looking really great these days, and wanted to congratulate her for her hard work. Also let her know that my friends (we're all in the same friend group) all think the same thing.

Would that still be considered rude? I just thought that she might like to hear that since she put so much effort into making a change for herself. I really hope that I wasn't out of line saying those things...

EDIT: Also wanted to clarify our relationship. We weren't besties or anything. And I never really talked with her unless she was physically there. But we were 100% considered friends. I just don't like talking to people that much unless they're around."	TwoXChromosomes	TwoXChromosomes	-1

* The JP fandom has been discussing ÂÆ∂ like an Armin/Eren/Mikasa shared separate dwelling rather than a Survey Crops dorm building. Though I have to look back and see if they call the barracks something specific (hmm, I was thinking maybe Military Police dorm was given a specific kanji in the past?) Maybe if you remember in one of the guidebooks or something that mentions their living quarters? 

* Again, the redundancy is plain awkward. No one ever says Â∏∞„Å£„Å¶  and follows it up with ÁßÅÈÅî„ÅÆÂÆ∂„Å´. 'Go back home' is built into Â∏∞„Çã by default? So many JP fans think Isayama is hinting at their childhood home being rebuilt, rather than a parallel with CH.6(?).

------------------

* Wwwww~ Of course, it's always the pronoun-less bubbles that get misinterpreted and mistranslated the most. Just intuitively by the flow of the bubbles, I naturally read like ""Eren is at his limit, he can't do anything to Reiner in his condition= Retreat"". So I had to stretch it a bit to re-think the grammar into mistaking that it was Reiner who can't kill Eren. I was wondering if I had gone crazy for a bit. My Chinese reading ability is somewhere like 80-90%, but I was pretty sure your version was also the same pronounless way? But the interpretation and story flow would only have it that way.

* (It must be super convenient for you to be able to read the JP and CH raw every time!)

* I see the official English version do strange things with a lot of idioms and pre/suffixes for titles. I believe that they have to localize everything for the Western translation?

However, one thing that campaigns do to extract money is pay for things at an exorbent rate. We actually did see this with Clinton (they all do it, but at least we saw it happening through her emails) where they'd ""owe"" an ally some money so they'd buy a voter call list that's been curated and sold for way over price. But since there is no real stable and known market value for these things, the FEC doesn't count them in their audit. But trust me, at the end of every campaign, the coffers rapidly get depleted, even moreso if they know they will likely lose.

There are also complicated debt balancing tricks they do to extract money, in almost every campaign I've seen... Again, to funnel money to allies. But from what I've seen working in anti-money in politics PACs is it's usually set up like campaign takes on debt from XYZ, then campaign ends, and debt contracts are handed over to the party and then the party pays it off. These people are almost exclusively well established political insiders who just fundraise and in return get paid huge checks from the party. It's how the game is played.

I've also seen it where the contract is for several years, still paying out years after the campaign is over.

https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/12/the-best-and-worst-countries-for-paying-engineering-grads.html

Switzerland has the highest entry level engineering salary compared to the US (#2), Denmark is #3. 

And like in Germany for example, the average entry level salary is 42-44k euros. If you convert that to USD it's also 50,000 a year lol. 

I'm not saying that the salaries will never downturn, but I think of it similar to lawyers and doctors. Engineers are just always needed in modern society, and the difficulty in becoming one will at least keep the numbers from going crazy. Even like lawyers who it seems aren't having the salary numbers as before still all do well enough. 

&gt;Why not push for people to be awesome critically thinking mechanics rather than engineers, they would have their own upward mobility within their passion.

The problem is it seems that there isn't that much upward mobility for mechanics unfortunately other than becoming the head mechanic or something wherever they work. Perhaps in they could do further training to eventually become managers or open up their own mechanic business or something. "	news	news	-1

"I think the main issue is that society is out of balance. Cost of living is much higher now than it‚Äôs been, in relation to average incomes, in the past, with a few exceptions, such as the depression etc. It‚Äôs a daunting task for the younger generations to generate the same financial success as their parents and grandparents when statistically, they are more than 50% less likely to have enough wealth to own their own home. As well, most graduates will spend the next 10 years minimum in debt from their education, having a hard time finding work in the field of their study, and most likely working minimum wage jobs only to live paycheque to paycheque, never getting ahead of their debt. 

It‚Äôs no surprise that after having all this established success shoved in their face by the media and our society of commercialism, seeing the older generations living the life because insurance was cheap and optional for them, where it‚Äôs costly and bound into law today, where credit was a vague notion to them, while it‚Äôs the only means of making a significant purchase today, because the credit company lobbyists applied enough pressure to enforce their agenda, making you depend on their credit score system to buy the things you need in life. It‚Äôs no surprise that millennials feel ‚Äúentitled‚Äù.

It‚Äôs easy to label millennials as spoiled and entitled losers, because most of them will fail, but just imagine how much harder your own life would be if you were one of the unlucky ones, born a generation too late to get the reality of the American dream.

Even ESB had significant time devoted to the political background and worldbuilding of the Empire. There was no equivalent worldbuilding of the New Republic or even really the First Order. That is the failing of the new trilogy.

In ESB we had the big evil empire and their huge warships and omnipresence in big cities like Mos Eisley. Tatooine and Yavin had specific and memorable architectures we spent solid time in.

Comparatively, there are a lot of people on Takodana in the bar, but it's essentially a big empty jungle with a castle on it.

2965	"&gt; What's the physical problem holding back scaling up quadcopters to human size?

Going to guess a few things make this more difficult than simply ""take this toy quadcopter and make it really big with a seat"".

It's bigger.  Bigger means heavier, which means material and structure considerations.  Airframe stresses will be greater.  Motors are bigger which mean bigger batteries, meaning power management is going to be complex.  How are they going to get the power/weight ratio so that they get optimal flight times and still have it meet the market in terms of the price that will make it profitable?  They will be carrying human cargo, meaning a lot of requirements for safety and design specs that must meet strict FAA guides for certification.  It also means that flight characteristics can't be the same as one not carrying living cargo -- it can't exceed a level of G-forces, acceleration has to be smooth, altitude changes can't be as abrupt.  An autopiloted vehicle carrying people means collision avoidance has to be really tight and there are also considerations that have to be taken including that there will be the expectation that this thing will be flying in aerial traffic and dealing with others also flying in the same airspace.  How does it handle a crash?  How does it deal with sudden inclement weather?  How does it know where to land?  The people on board will not have the ability to take over flight controls and aren't trained in how to fly so this thing has to be *fully* self controlled, always, in all conditions and situations.  That hasn't been done in any other aerial vehicle that carries people, before, ever and is not a trivial issue by any means.  Right now if an engine fails on your flight from Dallas to Atlanta, the pilot knows exactly what to do.  This thing will have to programmatically handle *everything* in terms of equipment, sensor, and engine failures and it will have to do it well.  It is *way* more difficult than, say, a self-driving car and we're not yet in production on those despite *decades* of development.

And this is only the stuff I can think of off the top of my head -- the actual engineers actually on this project are dealing with an incredible amount of other problems they'll be spending years on finding solutions to."

There. That's all of the services you can disable (or set to Manual) for optimized gaming.
Also, afterwards, before restarting your PC, I suggest:
1. Go to ""System"" settings in Control Panel
2. Click on 'System protection'
3. Click on 'Configure'
4. Turn on 'disable system protection'
This might sound risky, but it doesn't affect Windows Defender. It only disables constant hard drive saving in case you want System Restore to happen.

God was not born with the Islam for God is Everliving. What do you think about the rules and rituals in the Islam? Do you think they were born with Muhammad saws? There are many things that were changed back to how God wanted it and there were also new things. We believe in God of the Psalms and God of the Scriptures and the Torah. Does this mean we are adapting those? 

You can also say that God always sent rituals and rulings to other generations. It was forgotten and forsaken by those generation like Tawheed before Islaam. "	I agree with you on a lot of points.

I do, however, know enough about the mechanics of language and translation to know that meaning is not suddenly lost just because a perfect translation does not exist. Latinx was created by English speaking Latinxs in the search for a gender inclusive and neutral term which, as you and I clearly both know, does not inherently exist in the Spanish language by nature. 

You're derailing the conversation to fit your narrative. Regardless of the perceived correctness in other languages, the conversation takes place in English regarding English speaking conventions and correctness by English standards. You're bringing the argument places that it does not need to go because you personally find it incorrect by Spanish speaking conventions. That's not the point. If Spanish speakers have a word they prefer in their language over the Spanglish convention, that's fine. But since the current English convention favors Latinx, in the conversation at hand *that's correct*.

2994	"&gt; Previous SCOTUS precedent runs contrary to what you imagine the clause to mean.

Justices can be wrong.  I get that the precedent is contrary, but it wasn't the original intent of the authors of the Constitution to have it read in such a manner.  You can find that in much of the debates during the adoption process of the Constitution where such expansive reading of the Constitution was feared, and a far more narrow interpretation was intended.

The hole to make the interstate commerce clause mean Congress has practically no limits at all in terms of regulating the lives of individual citizens is precisely what everybody was trying to avoid when the federal government was established in the first place.

&gt; He either purchases the wheat

If the wheat isn't on hand, he could also simply slaughter the animals or switch to some other form of fodder.  It doesn't need to be wheat purchased from somebody else.  That is precisely why it is a fallacious argument.  There are literally unlimited options *besides* simply buying grain on the market.

It is entirely unreasonable to say the farmer would purchase grain, as that is presupposing that there was no alternative at all.

I get this is the justification, but in this case the justice was simply wrong.  These justices aren't gods who pontificate the final word on everything, and they also don't operate in a perfect environment free of political considerations as well.  In this case it was a justice who was trying hard not to get FDR to pack the court with a bunch more justices to overturn his decision and to toss FDR a small bone in his direction to show there might be a plausible legal cover for his actions.

The end result of this decision though is to massively expand the scope of the federal government.  For the most part, the federal government was never supposed to be controlling the behavior of ordinary citizens, but rather to be a referee between states.  The only time the federal government should have been involved with citizens is primarily when they were dealing with citizens of other states or when citizens were going to or from other countries.  This decision threw that whole concept out the window (although as you point out previous courts also disregarded that principle)."

25 F Traveling to Singapore/Indonesia/ Australia in November. I am going on a 19 day NCL cruise along with a few nights stay at each end (Singapore/Sydney). I am flying with Emerites airlines from Boston, with a layover obviously in Dubai before heading to Singapore. 
My stops on my cruise are : Singapore,, Semarang, Bali, Komodo Island, Darwin, Cairns, Airlie Beach, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney

I have a few questions:


1. I check the dimensions /weight for Emerites, and I am allowed 2 checked bags (50lb each)  and ONLY 1 carry on that can not exceed 15lbs. I plan on using the 2 check bags ( we will have 4 in total, since I am traveling with a SO). I understand that this is a lot of bags allowed, but I bring my camera/laptop/electronics/medicine as a carry on.

3020	"Even the most enthusiastic masturbator in the world is unlikely to publicly declare that his masturbation and pornography use are something he is proud of. But is there really any harm in it? The Catholic Church defines masturbation as a mortal sin. In this post I am going to defend the view that the Church teaching on this issue is morally coherent.
     
**1. Maturbation Is Sexually Disordered**

Let me begin with a modest claim about masturbation: It is highly doubtful that a good counterargument can be mounted against the view that masturbation is sexually disordered‚Äîwhere ""disordered"" is understood to mean, ""contrary to the normal and healthy functioning or purpose of something""‚Äîin this case, human sexuality. 

Clearly enough, a boy who is rubbing his genitals has not discovered the unitive and reproductive ends towards which the motivating urge is directed. Who can deny that he still has an important further fact to learn about sex? Or, if the masturbator is an adult man, who can deny that what is missing from the room when he masturbates is as critical to the completion and fulfilment of human sexuality as is an opponent to a solitary man on a tennis court who wishes to play a game of tennis? 
      
Peter Damian, a Doctor of the Roman Catholic Church, has even suggested that masturbation is a form of low-grade homosexuality‚Äîa point which entails masturbation is disordered *ipso facto* for *heterosexual* men. [1] The claim is as amusing at first glance as it is reasonable on reflection. For consider what is happening when a man masturbates: In a room in which a woman is nowhere to be found, a male hand is bringing a male penis to orgasm‚Äîso be it that the hand and penis belong to the same man. In *The Porn Trap*, Wendy and Larry Maltz make the further point that, for this very reason, heterosexual boys have always tried to use pornography to ""heterosexualize"" masturbation, 

&gt;Rather than focus on the fact that they are stimulating male genitals, they can focus on the reassuring presence of a female.

The obvious qualification that *no female is actually present* gives the lie to the attempted deception: For in the final analysis masturbating to heterosexual pornography is no more a form of ""heterosexual sex"" than a shoe is ""food"" if while eating it I look at pictures of bread. But more on pornography in just a moment.
       
**2. Masturbation Is Morally Bad**

**2.1 It Is Paradigmatically Selfish**

That the act is perverse and paradigmatically selfish is, I think, fairly obvious. John Paul II, in his *Theology of the Body*, argues persuasively that, ""pornography and masturbation represent the destruction of the symbolic and nuptial meaning of the human body."" For, as he says, ""God gives all men and women erotic energy,"" that, ""forms part of that attraction between men and women."" [2] That, of itself, is a profound good. But it follows that, 

&gt;Sexual energy needs to find its outlet in love, not lust: In masturbation that erotic energy is turned in on oneself. Masturbation, therefore, is a symbol not of love but of loneliness.

**2.2 It Impedes Virtue and Produces Vice**

Consider: A man who constrains his sexual activity to one woman with whom he is in love enjoys the imposition of what is probably one of the few constraints upon his libido that is stronger than his libido‚Äîlove itself. In other words, a loving husband who only achieves orgasm with the woman he loves quickly discovers that in the interests of cherishing and respecting her he will frequently need to overcome and set aside his carnal urges‚Äîto give up on the idea of performing some sexual act that his wife finds embarrassing, for example; or to give up on the idea of having sex altogether in order to nurse his wife because she feels unwell‚Äîand so forth. In this way, over time, and by force of habit, his love and respect for the other surpasses his pursuit of personal gratification. And as Plato said, ""A man becomes brave by acting bravely."" He means that we shape our moral character over time by our moral choices. The implications of this should be obvious

You might object here that a loving but masturbating husband does all these things too only he also masturbates in private‚Äîperhaps the better to control his carnal urges. But this objection entirely misses the point. For the man who has an orgasm whenever he wants and with whatever fantasy or pornographic aid he wants does not enjoy *any* inter-personal constraint upon his sexual release. C. S. Lewis understood this well when he wrote,

&gt;The real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete and correct his own personality in that of another and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides ... For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity.

**2.3 Pornography Massively Compounds the Moral Problem**

Masturbation is almost always coupled with pornography abuse. Lewis himself wrote well before the spread of online pornography. However, the relevance and wisdom of his warning is greater than ever. On the subject of pornography the Catechism of the Catholic Church reads,

&gt;Pornography does grave injury to the dignity of its participants since each one becomes an object of base pleasure and illicit profit for others. 

It is logical: You cannot love, respect and will the good of another human being and simultaneously derive gratification from watching them do something harmful or have something harmful done to them. The question arises: Is choosing to become a pornographic actress a good thing for a woman to do?

The question can be brought home by imagining that your mother, sister, daughter or wife is the woman in question. Sexual intercourse has the potential to be the most wonderful experience of human life‚Äîfrom its romantic and unitive force in a loving relationship to its production of children and so of family love. Contrast this with the life of a pornographic actress for whom sex and love are alienated so that her body can be objectified for profit.

If you cannot with perfect equanimity entertain the prospect of one of your loved ones becoming a pornographic actress then you are morally compromising yourself every time you watch and masturbate to pornography. For to enjoy pornography and masturbation one has to follow the *opposite* moral path of the man who constrains his sexual activity to one woman with whom he is in love; namely, he has to allow his sexual desires to eclipse his love and respect for the other. And to do so‚Äîand to make a habit of doing so‚Äîis, Plato reminds us, simply to become a perverse, selfish, callous and unloving person.

This argument holds with respect to any form of pornography whatever; but it holds *a fortiori* with respect to the sort of pornography that has become almost normative online in recent times. There are various studies that can now be found on the prevalence and frequency of verbal and physical aggression towards woman in pornographic videos today. A fairly typical example reviews 304 popular videos and reports that,

&gt;88% of scenes contained physical aggressive behavior (such as choking or spanking), and 49% contained verbal aggression (mostly name calling). Almost all (94%) of aggressive behavior was directed towards women and elicited a positive or neutral response.

**Conclusion**

Indulging in masturbation and pornography is morally inimical because it is sexually disordered, paradigmatically selfish, promotes vice in the form of the pursuit of personal pleasure above the good of the other, and supports an industry that objectifies and injures the dignity of its participants. The *a priori* coherence of Catholic Church teaching on this subject is a small item of further evidence for the truth of the Catholic Faith. And I believe the moral wisdom of all this is taught and neatly compendiated by Jesus in Matthew 5:27‚Äì28.

[2] I think the core argument is scarcely affected by the substitution of ""Nature"" or ""biological evolution"" for God as the origin human erotic energy."

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/FNnmZuPBSPM) on how exactly the media actively blacked out Ron Paul's presidential run.

"	"I think the author is wrong on most counts about Bitcoin. Personally, I think Bitcoin has problems, but the fundamental idea (as iterated on by competing cryptocurrency systems) doesn't have many of the problems the author mentions and has a number of benefits the author strangely omits in favor of pretending the whole purpose of Bitcoin was to not pay fees.

The rapid rise in value isn't because of a fixed supply of coins as the author states because... we're far from reaching that limit. It's not because we can't ""print"" money because at this stage, we are able to mine currency which is printing money. The rapid rise in value is because of the rapid rise in how many people value it.

The limit to the amount of transactions Bitcoin can process is largely based on arbitrary technical decisions that were made by the small group of developers that control Bitcoin and could be changed at any time. Also the point about waiting a while for transactions to settle ""unlike"" Visa is misleading. There is often a period of hours to days between when a person swiped their card and when that transaction is actually processed and reflected as well.

The author keeps arbitrarily suggesting that the purpose of Bitcoin is to have no ""fees"" and then suggesting that if it carries fees that it's pointless. That's not really true. We already have a way of paying without a processing fee: cash. Bitcoin's value isn't about less fees, it's about less control. Bitcoin doesn't require you to reveal anything about yourself, doesn't require you to get permission in order to perform a transaction and doesn't carry any ""terms"" you must agree to. With alternatives, payment companies can arbitrarily and without warning deny the processing of funds (e.g. wikileaks, fetlife), generally collect and share information about you and your use of the accounts, try to monetize you and require you to agree to a variety of terms. Bitcoin's appeal is getting rid of that stuff.

&gt; There is, of course, a pretty simple solution here. That's just ... increasing bitcoin's memory. The people who run it, though, have ruled that out. Why? Because that would require a modicum of trust, and they want to abolish that entirely.

The people who run Bitcoin are employed by a company which develops software for doing off-chain transactions. In other words, they directly profit from hindering the capacity of Bitcoin so that is likely why they aren't increasing the ""memory"".

&gt; If you don't want to do that, then you can't really add more bandwidth to the bitcoin system. Here's why: The more data there is, the more computing power you'd need to win the mathematical races that decide who gets new coins. And in that case, mid-sized miners would have a harder and harder time competing.

That's not true. There are alternative algorithms that can be used. And right now, mining is intentionally hard. Difficulty can be adjusted. Also, the block size is far enough from being a burden that decent increases to it wouldn't reach the point of pricing out mid and small sized miners."	Economics	Economics	-1

What I'm getting at is that you seem to be promoting the idea that having large numbers of guns around makes the country safer due to all the defensive gun use you think occurs.  I was just wondering, therefore, why despite a fairly typical overall crime rate for a developed nation, the US has so many murders.  You see it appears quite likely that the very fact so many people have guns for defence is one of the causes of the high murder rate because even minor offences like stealing a car become shootouts when ""good guy with a gun"" runs out of his house with his glock and starts a shootout with ""bad guy with a gun"", turning a minor property crime into a potential murder if good guy loses.  The stats seem to support this to some extent, do you consider it possible?  Or to put it another way, if high gun ownership is the key to self defence, why are you so much more likely to be murdered in the one developed country (I believe?) that allows owning a gun for self defence?

3052	"I remember a professor giving a simple parable example of a [Decision problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem). The [Buridan's ass problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass).

In real world computing, random noise often makes the choice. It randomly biases the decision to one or the other.

&gt;A version of Buridan's principle actually occurs in electrical engineering.[7][8][9][10][11] Specifically, the input to a digital logic gate must convert a continuous voltage value into either a 0 or a 1, which is typically sampled and then processed. If the input is changing and at an intermediate value when sampled, the input stage acts like a comparator. The voltage value can then be likened to the position of the ass, and the values 0 and 1 represent the bales of hay. Like the situation of the starving ass, there exists an input on which the converter cannot make a proper decision, and the output remains balanced in a metastable state between the two stable states for an undetermined length of time, **until random noise in the circuit makes it converge to one of the stable states.**

In computing 1/2 bit of noise is sometimes added to an input for precisely this reason. On a series of sampled data, the random noise can actually give a better precision to a measurement than without it.

Dithering:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither

&gt;Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data, and is often one of the last stages of mastering audio to a CD."	Infant brains are fairly undeveloped.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that people are stupid. I think it‚Äôs more a mental kind of laziness. Very smart people can have this attitude towards a lot of things such as movies. People approach film as a consumable that should require zero mental energy, which I guess is valid for entertainment but is a problem where art intersects with that.

No offence to Americans, but having the bulk of film money come from the US worsens the problem. There seems to be a practice of always remaking stuff from UK, Europe, Australia, NZ, etc.  The way the US version ends up being different is this blunt, exaggerated, often cliche version of the original. It enables this approach to film as something within the safe narrow confines of what people already know.

For example, there‚Äôs a good Australian film called Animal Kingdom based on a real life crime family in Melbourne with some great performances too. It was transformed into an American TV series of the same name, reset as a crime family in California, with the same plot points but this very classic melodramatic American style that overexplains what was nicely understated in the film and that loses what was unique or interesting about the original. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of potentially good movies marred or even ruined by overexplaining. I found it confusing that people found Inception confusing. Primer is confusing. Confusing can be fun.

"Okay, [found a study](https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/419017). My information above was right in some places, but also somewhat invalidated in others. And again, this is in regard to Type 2 Diabetes, but insulin resistance is *the* core component of T2D, so I'm rolling with the assumption that your SO's issue is similar or related 

BTW, be sure to follow up on that ""insulin resistance"" diagnosis further, and get a full panel of blood work and urinalysis. Your health is important.

--------

Technically speaking, eucaloric intake of carbohydrates is not stored as fat, but will be oxidized for fuel as glycogen (that's where the aforementioned resistance training helps, as glycogen is a primary component of the repair process for muscles). *Excess* carbohydrates above TDEE will be stored as fat.

In the absence of carbohydrates, the body will convert fat for energy, hence why low carb diets tend to work, but in the end it's still calories in calories out as the most important component. 

The types of fats and carbohydrates matter too. Sugars and simple carbs (starches, flour, stuff like that) will cause insulin spikes and tend to cause an increase in triglycerides, whereas a healthy caloric diet with healthier fats and complex carbohydrates correlate with a decrease in triglycerides and HDL (""good"" cholesterol).

-----

So take it as you will. The above diet (high fat, moderate protein, low carb) probably just worked for me because fats tend to be more physically dense and satisfying per caloric intake than carbohydrates, and are therefore easier to moderate. Combined with the probability of imperfect calorie counting and food cravings (eating sugar and carbs tends to make you crave more carbs, particularly in foods with HFCS), a higher fat, lower carb diet is simply easier to maintain when trying to lose weight, or was for me."

3078	"&gt; Theologically, Islam is closer to Christianity than Judaism is. Muslims think Jesus was the Messiah and was born  of a virgin and will return. They just don't think he was God.

I really fail to see how this can be the case.  Judaism and Islam both have strong traditions of the oneness of God, either as tawhid or the shema, and place this at the absolute center of their theology.  To both faiths, trinitarianism is a great sin, typically considered avodah zarah in Judaism and shirk in Islam.  It's my understanding that rabbinical rulings allow for jews to pray in Mosques, but not Churches, specifically because Christianity is further away in theology to the point that it becomes sinful.  There are tons of quasi-theological matters that are closer in Judaism and Islam than they are in Christianity- their reliance on scholarly decisions, the privileging of jurisprudence, revelation by prophet-and-text, an indescribability or unknowability to god, etc.  In many ways Islam (barring their desire to proselytize Jews) is an ideal gentile religion.  Not so for Christianity.  That muslims recognize Jesus as the Messiah is not a strong rejoinder considering how extremely differently that title is utilized in Muslim and Christian contexts.  If I'm being honest it's not clear Muhammad knew what the Messiah was or what it implied when he recognized Jesus as such.  Jesus' real meaningful place of privilege in Islam is as an eschatological figure.  That he happens to be included in the Islamic listing of prophets alongside Israelite prophets (while holding comparable significance) does not negate the proximity of Islamic and Jewish accounts of God, especially compared to Christians.

*is a secondary detail* LOL 



&gt;One doesn't need to believe if Jesus rose from the dead to understand why one should follow in his path



The earliest creed was that Jesus rose from the dead and that he was god... *because* he rose from the dead. Jesus Christ's alleged resurrection *is the religion.*



You mentioned babies, let me tell you the ABCs of Christianity: Jesus promises to raise people from the dead after he comes back from the dead. This is the entire point of the religion, Jews were living well before Jesus this is what Jesus and all Jews meant by saying the law is sufficient. There was no need for Jesus in terms of what laws to keep, save for the few he commanded, I mean all the gospels depict a Jesus who knew he would die approx 3 years before he did die



Also since Jesus claimed to be the same God who wrote the Jewish Law, it is absurd to assume he found faults in it. Something about not coming to abolish the law but to fulfill it.

Actually, why even send Titan shifters to do the job? Marley didn't know that the King would not make good on his promise to release the Wall Titans, so any sort of overt attack would probably have been a bad idea. A possible approach would have been to send a couple of Marleyan infiltrators with some fanatically loyal Subjects of Ymir and do a long-term infiltration, long enough to locate, get close to and kidnap the current king in the walls and have one of your subjects of Ymir eat him in his sleep before anyone knew what's up. 

Pieck and Zeke would be necessary for transport and to scale the walls respectively, but they wouldn't have to be involved in the infiltration proper.

Absolute scenes.

"	"Hi everyone!

I'm planning to buy a camera, mainly to take pics when I travel but also as a general camera for all uses (family gatherings, some street photograph etc.). So something lightweight and good for casual use. I am still undecided between two Fuji products, the **X-100F or the X-T20**.  
I read extensively about pros and cons and it just boils down to the question if I want something simpler, lighter, and ready ""out of the box"" but not extensible, or something which requires more study, light but slightly heavier (once you add lenses), but also more flexible because of the interchangeable lenses.  
And of course the price is another big factor since the X-T20 with 18-55 + 35mm (the setup I would go for), is 40% more expensive (~‚Ç¨1,400 vs ‚Ç¨1,000), so I will also have to think about this. None of these two cameras has weather sealing but you can't have it all.

I'd like to know your thoughts about it and also ask you some help about something probably silly for you: **what else should I buy, what accessories, as a total newbie?**

I would like to start slow, buy only the necessary stuff, and build from there. And, as mentioned, I plan to use it for travelling (I'll travel soon) and for a general use. I know that according to the camera I choose some stuff can be more or less useful but I think that there are some accessories which are considered a *must buy*, it doesn't matter the skills level or the usage.

These are my first thoughts / questions:

* **Memory card**: this is a no brainer, unless I want to use the camera as a paperweight. I put my eyes on a Sandisk Extreme Pro U3 128GB for ‚Ç¨70. I think that for my usage one card for now is enough, but I could go for two in case, what do you think?
* **Battery**: Do I really need an extra battery? Or one is enough considering the casual use? Also, I have difficulties to find a compatible NP-W126S here, I guess that the older NP-W126 is not good, right?
* **Tripod**: Should I go for a small, cheap, tripod for my use? Or can I pass on for now? Say I go for an hike, do you see any real utility or at least for now it's wasted money? I've also the same doubt about a possible remote :-)
* **Bag**: I plan to use mainly my backpack so I am not looking for a backpack just for the camera, any suggestions for a small bag? Possibly something I could use with my backpacks, to keep the camera, and in case I go for the X-T20 the couple of lenses (general advices are welcome, no need for specific models in case since they could be hard to find here);

Am I missing anything? Do I need hoods, filters, cases...? Really, anything you could think of.  
Just keeping in mind that this is for an amateur who's looking for the basic equipment, I'm not keen on spending already hundreds of Euros in equipment which maybe I won't even use much, or which is not necessary at least at the beginning.  
Googling on some sites, it seems like *everything* is necessary and no wonder it's like that, since all the articles link to affiliate accounts.

B) Because the actual voter ID laws ended up disenfranchising poor people without driver's licences and passports. Which was typically ~3-5% of registered voters, most of whom were poor blacks and latinos (and democrats). The number of people who would have lost the right to vote from these laws was ~1000-10000x as many as the number of cases of voter fraud.

Another side note: I've lived in Colorado my whole life. I know that weed culture is a big thing here, but it's so commonplace now that it really doesn't seem any different than before it was legal.

It‚Äôs an easy industry to vilify, and I routinely have family members forwarding me articles about the cost of medicines. I get it. It‚Äôs frustrating.

One thing to keep in mind is that these companies provide a ton of upper middle class jobs.  I have generous benefits. A 401k with 6% of salary matched.  A pension.  And enough money to take vacations, save for retirement, and send my children to good schools.  All the things that people keep saying that employers should provide.  

Pharma hasn‚Äôt been subject to the same ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù model of globalization and outsourcing that so many other industries have been forced to adopt. 

In some ways it isn‚Äôt your medicines that are too expensive, but rather your 70 inch led TV, your food, and your furniture are too cheap. The intellectual property models in those industries allow margins and workers‚Äô salaries to be compressed.

"I don't know why you think any place of business should pass up an easy opportunity to appeal heavily to an eager consumer demographic, nor why any consumer should pass up the right to make clear to businesses what they would need to change if if the business wants their money.

And especially in this situation it's really not that hard. A steakhouse shouldn't have good vegan options? There are plenty of great opportunities they have to put in items which all fit perfectly well within the theme of a steakhouse and wouldn't really cost any extra money or appeal less to their usual consumer base.

A steakhouse is already serving soups, salads, and sides to their dishes. Tiny changes could be made to make those items vegan and appealing to a large and ready to pay demographic. It's like, strictly a win win scenario."	pics	pics	-1

It's hard to wrap your self worth up in someone else's dream. Just like you couldn't stay in Maryland for him, he couldn't move to Florida with you, even though it sounds like he tried. I think in the end he just couldn't go through with it even if he really wanted to be with you. It's a difficult conversation for him to have with you, it sucks all around. You're not wrong to be upset with him, but he might have been wrestling with some feelings on this as well. Eventually you'll probably talk and know more.

The question becomes this, then. Correct me if I am wrong, but he was under the legal age of consent, correct? If so, it is statutory rape by definition.

And I also believe that we may be part of a multiverse, or that there is just a whole lot we don't know and understand. But that it's entirely possible that there exist places/dimensions/whatever where space and time as we conceptualize them don't exist, or exist in a different way.

And for me, my notion of 'god' lies both in the reality of our universe (that we are all one, that we arose from the earth/universe and continue to be a part of it even in death/decomposition) and in the mystery beyond our universe (who the fuck knows what that is). 

So even though I'm not traditionally 'religious', I do feel spiritual, and feel that 'god' is a concept that transcends the physics of our particular universe and understanding.

3183	"It's already a retcon. A parasitic worm was found by the Xel'Naga on an ash world called Zerus (barren volcanic wasteland), after they messed with the protoss development. They boosted the evolution of the parasite, enhanced it. It began to take over the creatures it inhabited and started to 'shape' them. 

Xel'Naga then created the Overmind to control these creatures. The Overmind wanted to expand further, attacked the Xel'Naga and consumed them, gaining immense knowledge about biology and genetic engineering - sending the Zerg into overdrive. They infested a bunch of space whales and set out to find the 'other' race created by the Xel'Naga.

The Overmind's pursuit for perfection isn't inherently 'evil' - it is primal. He seeks what it believes is the road to perfection. 

Once it got hold of Aiur it was ready to fulfill its destiny. If any corruption was there, it was the Overmind being 'sidetracked' because of the Terrans and ghosts - leading to Kerrigan.

If the Terrans wouldn't have gotten involved, the Overmind would have claimed total victory and turned the Zerg into the next Xel'Naga. 

Before SC2 was released, when the hidden missions came to light that Duran was working for someone else ... I was hoping that he would have been a last remnant of the true Xel'Naga and that they would indeed seek to remake their race through the hybrids and that indeed Kerrigan was the only thing standing in their way, as the protoss were all but annihilated - and in their arrogance wouldn't see the Terrans as a threat.

The problem is, this company could now charge whatever they want because they have the patent to insert this gene which saves lives. Supply and demand is brutal when the market is ""everyone with cancer"" and those not going to buy are going to die. It still works from a supply/demand capitalist standpoint, but it's very cold hearted. If others could compete, using the patent but having to pay a royalty, the companies can still profit from their research (say you're getting 10% of each of your competitors profits as well as selling your own) but there is now competition. Also, this allows others to hopefully expand off this work, and create newer and better medicine. "	It's that scalars going to infinite values problem, right?

"My mom was very afraid of the concept of my hitting puberty and didn't know how to deal with it. My dad was less freaked out about it but really withdrawn on the subject, to where the idea of discussing sex or anything close was so beyond his level of comfort that we didn't even get close to that. My mom was very concerned because I got my period when I was 10 and started wearing a bra in the 3rd grade. I'd get honked at from cars when I was still very much a child and I think it (rightfully) scared the shit out of her.  
My mom responded by being very, very honest about what I was going to experience from boys and men my entire life and essentially **pounded** the mindset into my head that men are trash dogs that only want to fuck. That level of indoctrination mixed with 12 years of private Catholic school, I developed a rebellious streak that funneled perfectly into using sex as a way to get back at my mom for trying to cage me, or whatever, but also completely exposed me to the kind of guys that I was afraid would hurt me.

3203	"&gt; A deeply important issue if we go further than two and a half thousand years ago, that was supplanted by revolutionary changes in the context of religion around that long ago...

One need not travel 2500 years into the past in order to find polytheists.  You only need to visit India in the present day.  Your assertion that religion is solely monotheistic is culturally myopic and fundamentally unsupportable.

I'm reminded of a joke: 

*A journalist, researching for an article on the complex political situation in Northern Ireland, was in a pub in a war-torn area of Belfast. One of his potential informants leaned over his pint of Guinness and suspiciously cross-examined the journalist: ""Are you a Catholic or a Protestant?"" the Irishman asked.*

*""Neither,"" replied the journalist; ""I'm an atheist.""*

*The Irishman, not content with this answer, put a further question: ""Ah, but are you a Catholic atheist or a Protestant atheist?""*"	"They absolutely are waning. Many studies in recent years have found that developed nations are becoming more secular, these nations generally score better on metrics used to determine societal health, and movements like secular humanism are growing rapidly in the US. You also see far fewer followers of orthodoxy and an explosion of ""progressive"" belief that is a regression of actual doctrine. The new God is more vague and weaker than ever.

I don't think I would agree that god belief is a pathway to rational principles. It seems to me to be almost entirely the opposite. As Steven Weinberg said, it takes religion to make a good man do bad things.

The variety of builds is what makes this entry in the series great, change my mind;)"	I wouldn't say cheese strategies are necessarily zero skill. They certainly can take near-zero mechanical skill, but in order for them to work (outside of balance issues anyways) you need to exploit the other players expectations about how the game works. If some cheese is working really well then other people are going to start doing it and players should learn how to avoid it. Maybe you can get a few wins in before that by just copying the cheese strat, but once people start adapting to it then you need to as well and if you can't then it isn't necessarily that the cheese stopped working but that you were too bad to recognize how you needed to adapt it.
