Who is not dealing with day to day of a business. Also cognitive task in general have shown a negative relation between higher compensation and performance [study](http://www.novarete.com/blog/motivate-employees-monetary-incentives-produce-poor-performance) it mentions two studies. The study in the article I listed in my first response even showed that was not actually true if you look at the research where they looked at a 10 year focus. Yes but multiyear performance metrics are set by the CEO even so the compensation is negotiated by the CEO and the board wants to keep the CEO happy and make it seem that they are doing well so they will take a median pay for a lot of CEO's then pay above that because they don't want to give the interpretation there CEO is performing bad for public image or whatever the reason may be. Metric's are not always company focused but purely shareholder which is not long term focused. Here is a [link](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/how-companies-decide-ceo-pay/530127/) to a piece by the Atlantic it does an excellent job explaining how compensation actually works for these large organizations.

More likely, women have more social and societal mobility to chose their partners and women have the opportunity to remain single if they so desire. Society previously, and I would argue still, puts pressure on women to find their value through their relationships. Modern society has hopefully reduced those pressures a bit therefore changing the demand for relationships, but I don’t see the correlation with male shyness and flirting as these aren’t necessarily relational currency.

25	"&gt; You say it's not true, but I've watched documentaries that detail the tactics I'm referring to. It's funny that you mention your military background as the training is more similar to the combat training you give a soldier than for dealing with civilians.

Your proof is a documentary that you watched and you're calling me biased? Wtf?

Also, I don't think you know how a military base works. Depending on the base, the military police personnel will cover both inside the base, (which would typically be military personnel) and outside (which is civilian). You also forget that military personnel have dependents, which are civilian. You're also assuming that military personnel are void of any irrational thinking. How the heck are you gonna call me biased when you're saying things like you know better than me even though I SPECIFICALLY had to deal with the opposite of what you're telling me?

&gt; I'm sure they also ""teach"" deescalation techniques, but that is not the focus by any means.

How is it not? That was the exact discussion we're talking about.

&gt; How about the video of the man that politely and calmly informed the officer that he had a legally registered firearm in the vehicle, as would be protocol to inform the officer. He didn't reach for anything, the officer was just so threatened by the possibility of a black man being within reach of a firearm that he drew his gun and killed the man on the spot.

This is another thing you think you know about but you don't. The man wasn't shot because he said he had a gun on him. The man was shot after he said he had a gun on him when he was trying to reach for his ID. The officer perceived that as a threat.

&gt; He was instructed to do about 10 different things by different officers with contradictory instructions.

Still means nothing when that wasn't the reason why he got shot. He was also definitely not instructed by different officers at once. He was instructed by one.

&gt; Regardless of that, if you believe that ""reaching for your shorts"" constitutes shooting someone, you should live in the Philippines or North Korea.

Aaah, the good 'ol conservative ""IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GO LIVE IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY!"" argument. Here, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfi3Ndh3n-g. You'll find that reaching for shorts is justifiable.

&gt; There's no other first world country that tolerates the level of force, violence, and intimidation used by police in the U.S.

There's no other first-world country with this level of violence or capabilities to obtain weapons either. If a cops gotta deal with that, expect some shit to occur.

&gt; Not to mention racial profiling and corruption. It's a broken system that needs to be completely overhauled from the top down, and the inexplicably awful training given to police officers is the worst offender.

You still don't know jack shit about how cops are trained other than a documentary that is likely very biased. Racial profiling and corruption exists but probably not at the amount you think it does. In fact, that's probably the case since you believe all police officers are undertrained even though I've told you otherwise."	"I'm not getting any hopes up tho.

And there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!

The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!

Today, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?

And what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!

So rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!

For we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both the heavens and the earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!

Terrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!

And deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!

Trust in me, Whiterun! Trust in the words of Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!"	MovieDetails	skyrim	-1

I love the internet and this video is so sweet, but I hate how infactual everything has become even though that’s not a real word.	"I had a lot of the same problems as you. The line ""All we know about quantum entanglement suggests another go at it will decouple them"" or whatever didn't make very much sense. Perhaps they just know more about quantum entanglement than we do? Still that was mostly mumbo-jumbo about a subject we don't know enough about to dispute, though it doesn't seem to line up with what we *do* know.  
  
The rotating ship with the rotating outer rings obviously made me wonder about the gravity. Also the rings seems pretty small, no?  
  
Eva saying ""I need to save my family"" and the guy just accepting it was nonsensical to me. Obviously nena knows and cares about your family. She could easily tell Eva on earth about the fire and how to prevent it. They definitely should have stuck with her wanting to see her family but that couldn't have worked. Leave her husband/boyfriend here just to share your family with the other Eva? No. I was ultimately really happy it didn't work out.  
  
I also questioned some of the run-ins with the entanglement. The magnetic metal arms grabbing him and pulling him backwards, filling his orifices with threads of metal?? That didn't make sense. I thought initially the polarity of the magnetic pull would switch and he was gonna be impaled by all of the metal tools that gathered on the wall, but they went the more flashy route.  
  
However, despite all these, I still rather enjoyed the film. It helps I was not expecting it and it helps that I enjoyed the soundtrack. The effects, set design and cgi were all top notch and attempting to make a movie with such an abstract premise was brave IMO and I enjoyed that.

I feel like there are a ton of lucrative educational paths but most people ignore them because they are hard / boring. We will never not have jobs for talented engineers and doctors and programmers. Meanwhile a huge portion of my friends got English / Art degrees that don't allow them to do much except work a dead end job and the thing they studied for dissolves into a hobby as the pressures of adulthood mount.

And I think that's a big part of the problem. People chase their passion, rather than a sensible path. A lot more satisfaction can come from an ""arranged career marriage"" than trying to force your passion into a career. A lot of engineers I know didn't dream of growing up to be an engineer, but they love their jobs because it's challenging and rewarding and their paychecks match the value they provide.

Consider the size of the machines both the amount of space the machines will take up such as side by side or, if limited space, do you need stacked as well as how big of loads you need it to handle? Consider the needs of all users. Short people or older people may have difficulties with deep top loaders and find front loading easier to use. Shorter users may have trouble reaching the controls on some stacked sets as usually the dry controls are towards the top of the machine.  If buying used off craigslist or similar, ask if the machine is still set up and if you can run a test load. Sets do not need to match. Opt for more mechanical/manual dials and buttons over touch pads and other electronics.

Or if I say I just want one, people will say, “oh how could you do that to the poor kid!”  In that case I usually say “well I was an only child, and I think I turned out fine!” with a big smile, and that usually shuts people up, because damn straight, I did turn out awesome. ;)"	"No, nothing is obvious and you DON’T know that she wrote what she wrote simply to “purposely piss people off,” or to “provoke.”

1. Chimps hug for the same reasons humans hug. Sometimes during greetings, and sometimes during some kind of excitement - either ""negative"" excitement, like fear or anxiety, or ""positive"" excitement, like celebration or anticipation. In this case, the hugs were an expression of nervous excitement and joy.
2. The chimps in this gif are in excellent physical condition, but that's because they had been at the sanctuary for awhile before this large outdoor habitat was completed. They underwent some quick and startling physical transformations when they moved from the lab to the sanctuary. You can see an example here: [https://chimpsnw.org/2008/10/jody-changing/](https://chimpsnw.org/2008/10/jody-changing/)
3. This was the first time they had stepped foot into this enclosure. They previously had a smaller outdoor space, enclosed on all sides by steel caging. This new two-acre outdoor habitat offered them the most space they had had in their lives, and it was the first time they could see the world without looking through bars.

It's clear you guys are going through some truly trying times at the moment, and only you two know if you're going to be able to weather the storm...but if you can, if it's truly meant to be...let me tell you, that feeling really is great.

I can't tell you how many conversations my wife and I have had concerning how we almost lost it. How happy we are now, and how we almost threw it away. To be quit honest, in retrospect we almost lost sight of our MARRIAGE, and began thinking about our individual happiness. Those really are two different things.  And the MARRIAGES that don't last, are often because individuals put too high a value on INDIVIDUAL happiness.  No marriage guarantees that, and people are mistaken if they think that's a reasonable expectation.
We often reminisce about an agreement we made BEFORE we got married and that was to have the highest commitment to our marriage.  This wasn't based on any religious or particularly high moral standard, it was simply to the principle that we should only get married once.  I remember telling my bride to be that I though we should take our marriage so seriously that we should be willing to fight for it, and that I fully expected there would be times that not only would we be mad at each other, but we might not even like each other, but we should care enough about the marriage to fight through those times for the marriages sake...thank goodness that happened.

I've now hat the great pleasure to watch three amazing children grow to adulthood with an intact, nuclear family (somewhat of a rarity these days)...well almost, still have a 16 year old lol, but he's on his way, I had the great pleasure to watch my wife graduate from college (with honors no less!) this past Dec to now start her amazing career in the medical field after putting her dreams on hold to raise our family and let me chase my career goals all these year.  It's nothing but a bright future ahead as far as i'm concerned..Oh, and I still find her just as sexy and beautiful as the day I met her..

And to think, we could have thrown this all away if we were foolish enough to believe that for some reason marriage = happiness at all times...it can be a job, like anything else.  But like most jobs, when you work hard at it, ya know, really put in the time, the payout can be worth the investment.

I truly wish the best for you and your husband, I hope he gets out of his funk, sooner rather than later, and I hope you guys look back on this time years down the road as just your little ""bump in the road"" and you use it to encourage others.

"A financial asset's present value is usually the discounted value of future cashflows/growth. E.g. An office block's value is the future net rental cashflow's 'discounted' back at the investors required rate of return. Investors may asign different values to the same asset as they are using different required rate of returns or use different assumptions; mortgage costs, repair costs, vacancy etc.

The same can be used for stocks by estimated the future value of growth or dividends.

Bonds are the easiest as they are very simply valued based on their known cashflows (coupons) and redemption value (principle).

Edit: changed weak to unique."	"&gt;The DNC platform advocates for abortion up to and including 24 week mark, that's my issue.

I'm not sure where you're getting that, since if you look at the [actual DNC Platform](http://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.democrats.org/Downloads/2016_DNC_Platform.pdf) you'll find no such language. Here is the entire language of the Democrat's platform as it relates to abortion and childbirth:
&gt;Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to women’s, men’s, and young people’s health and wellbeing. We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment. We condemn and will combat any acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of reproductive health providers, patients, and staff. We will defend the ACA, which extends affordable preventive health care to women, including no-cost contraception, and prohibits discrimination in health care based on gender. We will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on gender, sexuality, race, income, disability, and other factors. We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions.  

Nowhere in there is ""we want to ensure elective abortion up to 24 weeks."" A number of pro-choice advocates, but certainly not all, have advocated against *banning* abortions at greater than 24 weeks, because such bans often do not take into account the health of the mother, or contain exceptions for incest and rape or where the baby would be born severely deformed and unlikely to survive. Since certain tests cannot even be performed until almost 20 weeks, any abortion restriction set at 20 weeks or earlier would essentially force women to carry to term children that were certain to be born dead or near-dead.

I think you're thinking of the issue of ""viability"" as it relates to *Roe v. Wade*? In that case, the Supreme Court determined that the State did not have a compelling interest in preventing an abortion until the fetus became ""viable,"" which the Court defined on the basis of medical science at the time as in the third trimester, or after 24 weeks. At the time *Roe v. Wade* was decided in 1973, that was completely accurate medical science; babies born at 24 weeks or earlier had virtually no chance of survival. Now, in 2018, babies born at 24 weeks have a roughly 50-70% of survival, though quite often if they do survive they suffer severe birth defects that will affect them throughout their lives.

Democrats now often oppose Republican's attempts to ""chip away"" at *Roe v. Wade* through laws which would limit abortions only to 20 weeks. The problem is that there's basically no good medical science declaring exactly where the line of ""viability"" is, or what that means under *Roe v. Wade.* Regardless of that, most scientists agree that 20 weeks is too low; there is virtually no survivability except in extremely rare cases for fetuses born at 20 weeks."	Music	worldnews	-1

Max levels comes around the end of the base game. Even when looking at pure story content there are now also two big expansions of story missions and two seasons of smaller story missions with a third in progress, so there's way more story to be had after max level. Like 3/4 of the game's story comes after max level.

If we compare this to the other topic about good endgame, this is like Pokemon Gold and Sun's second half after the credits, and that was an example of good endgame according to the other topic, so it's unfair to ignore that here.

So that was the ""unrepeatable"" content in the sense that it's kinda boring when you know what's going to happen.

At some point content is going to repeat. If we look at repeatable content, stuff that you do multiple times for rewards, that would be comparable to for example World of Warcraft Path of Exile from the ""good endgame"" topic, where you can create new characters or builds, farm instanced areas, raids.

All of these are in GW2 too. With condition builds being good now (where they were terrible on release) and with the expansions giving all classes new mechanics there are many ways to play professions so there's definitely reason and fun to be had in levelling new professions or builds you haven't tried before.

There's still the dungeons from the core game, and fractals expand on them by making them a bit more random to keep things interesting. Then another step up is to do raids.

And then on the completionist side (unrepeatable) there are so many fun achievements that have you explore entire zones for things you probably skipped over before.

Of course you'll eventually get bored, but that goes for all games from the ""good endgame"" topic. But your point that there's nothing to do after max level is just absurdly wrong."	leagueoflegends	Games	-1

In our educational materials they discuss how often nurses and providers get worried about injuring themselves, etc., and say that it is our hospital's responsibility to provide everything the healthcare workers need to NOT get injured and not have extra stress. That way, they can focus on patient care and not get worn and prejudiced. They also talk a lot about the different causes of obesity and why it's not a simple calories in, calories out thing and why it is not an indicator of moral failings.

To give you an idea of a typical Instagram feed's image size/resolution: here's a link to one of Pryana Chopra's latest images , from her feed. https://scontent-bru2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/64fdc6667ae01461f118c6e627161a2c/5B46623B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/28432663_445610499192407_5531525467561000960_n.jpg

It's not bad. I'm not certain as to whether or not it would print out nicely at 8*11. Should it not be the right size, you could always try squeezing two images onto one sheet instead of blowing up one shot and having it look off. 

Instagram MIGHT have higher resolution images stored on their servers, and they MIGHT share them with you. We're talking about two hypotheticals as far as that goes; but, I would absolutely start saving/scraping those images off of those Instagram feeds ASAP, and start the quality control process asap. Just know that the screengrabs you currently have are going to give you a much lower quality image resolutions than the method that I'm suggesting.

Figure out if you can do anything with the Pryanka's image for the moment. Try printing it (try black &amp; white as it won't be as printer ink/toner intense). 

Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt and please verify this, but I think your modeling talent, portfolio quality, and personality traits are factors which are ultimately going to weight more than whether or not your portfolio's format matches that of everyone else's. 

Sorry to hear about the bad news. Hope you get this sorted!"	Maybe there’s just less pressure to get it right when you’re trying it the first time so you don’t over analyze your movements.

One thing that has changed a lot more drastically than illumination levels at night is view distance. The modern view distance slider’s minimum is higher than vanilla’s maximum IIRC, and its maximum is like 30x further than vanilla’s max.

Now think about how this affects how nights appear: players from 04/05/06, many of which are running just middling view distance, are going to see a lot more silhouettes and sky than someone in 2018. Silhouettes are drawn with the sky’s fog color, which usually dark at night.

209	"To be fair, [in this article alone](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-spacex-nasa-20170301-story.html) they mention 2 billion dollars in NASA contracts that SpaceX received. I have bolded the relevant funding parts in the article below.

In 2006 SpaceX and NASA literally went halfsies on the Dragon and Falcon 9 (Nasa with 396 million and Spacex with 454). You're acting like SpaceX is funding things when NASA was an equal or majority investor in a lot of their projects.

SpaceX is really lean? Know what really helps with that? Fat contracts from NASA who is one of their primary clients. SpaceX is dope but you're riding the hype train pretty fucking hard dude. By their own admission, they would not be where they are today without NASA, and NASA contracts have provided the majority of the funding for big projects like the Dragon 2, so take it down a fucking notch with the ""NASA spent so much money and SpaceX is just so much more economical!"" type of shit. 

SpaceX is super awesome and I'm all for hyping them up, but don't forget who's been there every step of the way with financial and technical support: NASA.

&gt;SpaceX, the upstart company, and NASA, the government agency, both have plans to venture to Mars and orbit the moon. But that doesn’t mean they’ve launched a new space race.

&gt;In fact, NASA has long been SpaceX's most important customer, providing contracts to deliver cargo and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station. And the Hawthorne company will need NASA's technical support to achieve the first of its grand ambitions in deep space.

&gt;SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk acknowledged as much last week, shortly after announcing that SpaceX would launch two private, paying individuals on a weeklong lunar flyby in 2018.

&gt;**""SpaceX could not do this without NASA,"" Musk tweeted. ""Can't express enough appreciation.""**

&gt;NASA, on the other hand, has come to rely on SpaceX and other companies for transport to the space station as its funding has tightened. In today's dollars, the agency's budget is about half what it was at the peak of the 1960s, and down from the 1990s.

&gt;In the wake of the SpaceX news, NASA issued a statement that said it is ""changing the way it does business through its commercial partnerships,"" in part to ""free"" the agency to focus on rockets and spacecraft to go beyond the moon into deep space.

&gt;""The whole idea is that NASA is at the point of a spear,"" said Howard McCurdy, professor in the school of public affairs at American University. ""It's like exploration of any terrestrial realm. This is the way the model is supposed to work.""

&gt;Indeed, the rapid ascent of Musk and other space industry pioneers is validation of the public-private partnership envisioned when Congress passed the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984.

&gt;By the mid-2000s, NASA was signing contracts with the private sector to fill in for its own funding constraints and the impending retirement of the space shuttle program.

&gt;**In 2006, SpaceX won its first NASA award for $278 million to help develop the company's now-workhorse Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon space capsule. It later received an additional $118 million, and SpaceX contributed a total of about $454 million of its own funds to finish development, according to a NASA report.**

 &gt;**Two years later, SpaceX won a $1.6-billion NASA contract to transport cargo to the space station.** The deal came as the fledgling company of about 400 employees was starting to successfully launch the Falcon 1 from an atoll in the Marshall Islands.

&gt;It was not just NASA's financial resources and technical support that helped SpaceX, said company President Gwynne Shotwell, but also the agency's trust.

&gt;**""We would not be the company that we are today without that early support from NASA,"" Shotwell said. ""We would have made it, but it would have been more of a struggle, it would have taken us longer.""**

&gt;A major milestone for the partnership came in 2012 when SpaceX launched its first NASA cargo load, making it the first private company to send a spacecraft to the space station.

&gt;Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at the Teal Group, said the NASA supply missions gave SpaceX ""almost instant credibility.""

&gt;**""Having NASA as an anchor client allowed them to have enough revenue flow so that they could establish themselves and eventually diversify and get some commercial contracts and eventually to be able to get into the military establishment,"" he said.**

&gt;Today, SpaceX and Boeing Co. are developing separate crew capsules as part of NASA contracts to transport astronauts to the space station.

&gt;**SpaceX noted that this NASA program provided most of the funding to develop the Dragon 2 spacecraft, which will make the moon trip.** It is planning to conduct the first test flight of the Dragon crew capsule in November, followed by a flight test with humans in May 2018.

"As a real estate/architectural photographer this is one of the biggest battles we face, aside from lighting. Your mind ""autocorrects"" the distortion you see, because it's smart enough to know that the verticals lines of a building should be vertical. Camera lenses don't have that ability. Photographers have to use special (expensive) lenses and Photoshop to mimic what the mind's eye sees to create a photograph that matches the image your mind produces. It's an art form that is often overlooked. Anyone can take a photograph in this day and age. Making it look like what the mind sees is the art. "	canada	photography	-1

&gt;Max out your Smith and enchantress and start crafting lvl 70 weapons, trying to get level reduction (can roll up to 30 level reduction). if you do not get level reduction right away, an item that has % chance as a secondary is good as well. 

For DHs - don't craft bows or xbows. They often roll discipline - which makes it very hard to get a level reduction weapon. Craft Swords. Grenades, Chakram and FoK don't need a ranged weapon anyways. 

I think lvl 60 weapons can also roll with lvl reduction. Craftable at 42 or so.

Reworked Warwick makes me feel bad if I am not in huge control of the game after like 5 minutes because its so damn easy to jungle as him.

I always felt that unique items should (1) have fixed stats with the RNG depending on the numeric values of those fixed stats, and (2) be reasonably rare.

D3 changed dramatically since launch with regards to improving on the loot system, and it is much MUCH better than it used to be (remember finding an IK piece after 200 hours of a3 inferno with int, dex, gold pickup radius, thorns, and nothing else?)... But I don't really like the direction they went with it. I think that the fact that a super rare legendary item can still roll dogshit stats is frustrating.

It's basically crunching massive amounts of data to understand when those seemingly random situations occur.

That's how sales AI works as well, by feeding the algorithm, it analyses historical figures to predict the algorithm going forward, so that figures you may not have considered allow you to predict the market e.g. it may scan news articles and sales to see that the sales of fried chicken go up, when price of marijuana drops.

But, even if she were balanced, or, hell, underpowered, I think there's no way she should have had her range, her jump, and her ult. It's too much safety. 

Nerfing her range frees up power budget to focus on her other strengths.

"	"If we're talking semantics then from what I understand and what Wikipedia has the nomen (Julius) is a larger unit than we would typically use in the modern West to mean a family, hence the use of ""clan."" So it has the Julii *clan* not family. The cognomen (Caesar) began as nicknames but took on the meaning of a smaller branch of the nomen that would be more like our sense of ""family"" within a larger clan. And since there were relatively few praenomen they were less useful as identifying characteristics except for people close to you, which is why they abbreviated Caius to ""C.""

""During the period of the Roman Republic, the praenomen and nomen represented the essential elements of the name; the cognomen first appeared among the Roman aristocracy at the inception of the Republic, but was not widely used among the plebeians, who made up the majority of the Roman people, until the second century BC. Even then, not all Roman citizens bore cognomina, and until the end of the Republic the cognomen was regarded as somewhat less than an official name. By contrast, in imperial times the cognomen became the principal distinguishing element of the Roman name, and although praenomina never completely vanished, the essential elements of the Roman name from the second century onward were the nomen and cognomen.""

Maintaining a wall like that would cost the income of a small country on a regular basis. I could say the same about Winterfell and Storm's end. Apparently the walls at Storm's end are 40ft thick.

"At this moment, since there are only 25 participates and the city must be cherry picking their hires to make it look like the program works - I'd say the homeless probably don't use drugs at all, not even pot.

If this program were to be opened up to the masses, yes, many of them would spend the money on drugs and it wouldn't be just legal pot.

I think the program is a waste of taxpayer money.  The streets would get much cleaner if you hired actual workers to clean the roads for the same amount of money as undoubtedly the homeless will work at a snails pace compared to regular workers.

Will this program help homeless get off the streets?  Absolutely not if they continue to do it the way they are.  The homeless are restricted to 4 hour work days, 5 days a week max according to another poster here.  That is not enough in San Jose to get off the streets.  All it is fun money for homeless which I personally do not want to give them with my tax dollars.

For this program to even have a chance at working,, employees need to be drug tested routinely.    The work needs to be just one part of the program.  They need to  mental health counseling/medication, support groups, etc. They should be put in touch with housing support for the homeless.  And 4 hours of work isn't enough.  It would be a good stepping stone to get them used to working again but the City would need to find other jobs for them that are full time after an initial period.  And they really have to screen their applicants well.

Overall though, I don't like the idea of the people who litter being paid to clean up their own litter.  Would rather find them something else to do.

370	The easy answer is yes, it is more profitable to sell additional features than to include them for free but the harder to swallow answer has more to do with development than it does corporate. Major games these days have a lot more competition, and they stand out usually by advertising features. As a developer you want all your players to at least be aware of (if not interacting with) every aspect of the game you make. Where tony hawk pro skater 2 had hidden levels and cheat codes to play as spiderman, thats dead. And its not just because you want players to get to it, but games back then were not treated with the same professionalism as they are now. THPS2 was made with a team of about 180 people, working under a major publisher like activision, and had a development cost estimated under $2 million. Remember, those cheat codes and secret levels and characters still have to be programmed and debugged and licensed and everything. Compared to Gran Turismo 5, estimates say that it cost roughly $60 million excluding marketing costs. That game came out only ten years after THPS2, and its almost a decade old now. Costs to devlop have only continued to rise and rise and rise, with ever tighter release windows with increasingly complex code. Introducing a hidden level costs assloads of money and time to make now, for no guarantee it will ever be found, and it creates potential for game breaking bugs. An increased focus on multiplayer connectivity makes it thrice as hard, because you have to make sure that cheats can't carry over into multiplayer. It just isn't worth making any more, and its a shame but thats the reality :/	"No it was a guillotine style snap trap. No one ate from it.

If it was, it would be with his left hand, not with his right. The right is throttle. Left is clutch.

The rider is also gripping both bars because he has a steering wobble (you see the headlights bobbing subtly L/R). Doubt he had time to raise the visor because it would compromise steering control. Even if he raised his right hand as the blurry image shows, I doubt he was pushing on the visor.

411	"It's worth noting that while the Pulitzers are less affected by ""popularity"" (certainly moreso than the Grammy's), they have always accounted for how ""relatable"" and ""approachable"" the medium is. That's the ""journalism and the arts"" part. Academia and lab reports aren't what they're looking at, because presentation matters, and that's journalism and art's domain.

While you can argue about which Kendrick Lamar album is your favorite, and therefore should have won the award, you can't argue that not only DAMN. but the entire rap industry is a larger, more appreciable medium now than it was even 5 years ago. That matters quite a lot. We've seen several movies with Hip-Hop themes beyond ""learn to dance"" in recent years, delving into the deeper issues the genre covered that people outside of the fold either didn't acknowledge or didn't care to.

This award is certainly an oddity, and probably shouldn't set a precedent of main stream ""pop"" music winning Pulitzers, but what it does is open a door for the entire music industry, showing that excellence in writing and lyricism is not ignored just because it had a funky fresh beat over it.

I congratulate Kendrick, and the entire rap industry for this foundation-shaking award. Hopefully we'll see the popularisation of additional artists with gifts similar to Kendrick's with this victory. I am excited to see where the industry will head, and am eager to see where Kendrick's craft takes him and us with him."	"This theory is silly.

Teaching occurs in all walks of life. It happens in Universities, corporations, federal organizations, etc. Corporations can also be run on obedience and adherence to the rules rather than promoting free thinking and employee creativity. A lot of school superintendents are not trained on how to run an organization or how to solve problems. They create a culture of hierarchy vs community.

Every organizations has hierarchy. The most successful corporations don't promote hierarchy though. They emphasize teamwork and community. ""We all work together to make better product."" Schools emphasize heirarchy. They ~~don't~~ see the kids as the product. Which means you have to whip your product into shape so you look better. The best schools see the grades/performance as the product. What are the kids gpa? How are the sports team doing? How are the schools groups like FIRST robotics, Honor society, Orchestra, etc. doing?

457	"I think you switched the order you cited things in. In my response I'll assume ""Men among men do not take norm enforcement seriously"" is Source 2 and that ""Why Are Women Still Calling Each Other Sluts?"" is Source 1.

""Why Are Women Still Calling Each Other Sluts?"" was written by Sophie Cullinane, who herself is a feminist, arguing in an opinion piece that women ought to end the use of the word ""slut"" in order to further gender equality and further the cause of feminism. At no point does her article or the scientific paper she cites contradict my statement that the ways that men and women engage in slut-shaming are different and therefore are not comparable on a mere quantity scale. Furthermore, her claim that women slut-shame more than men is entirely unsourced, as the Social Psychology Quarterly article only talked about the ways in which women slut-shame (correlating the use of slut-shaming to class), not the quantities in which they slut-shame in comparison to men. In fact, ""Men among men do not take norm enforcement seriously"" actively disproves your assertion, describing how women only punish norm-breaking more in comparison to men in certain scenarios
&gt;all-male groups are less prone to punish, compared with all-female and mixed groups

and that on average there is no gender divide in regards to shaming norm-breaking

&gt;► We investigate whether men and women differ with respect to their inclination to punish norm-breakers. ► Generally, there is no such gender difference.

Assuming we can consider slut-shaming a type of shaming in response to broken norms, this would suggest your assertions are untrue.

""Men among men do not take norm enforcement seriously"" also disproves the argument you made with this source that women are the primary enforcers of gender roles. Your own sources disproves you on this.
&gt;► We investigate whether men and women differ with respect to their inclination to punish norm-breakers. ► Generally, there is no such gender difference.


I apologize, as I accidentally misinterpreted your original statement on catcalling, but you are still wrong. Catcalling is not a means of actually soliciting sex, but a performative ritual meant to empower men's confidence at the expense of women, who feel harassed. 
https://www.theodysseyonline.com/understanding-street-harassment?sec=poplifetime&amp;utm_expid=.53hHQ_sIS_GVYl9TPM4psw.2&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F

It is possible women at some point might adopt a similar custom of harassment to boost their own confidence, but I doubt that that eventuality is a given, and believe that even were that situation to occur that many feminists would see it for the problem it is and push back on it.

Feminists claim that the abolition of rigid gender roles helps both genders in order to convince men to sign on to abolishing rigid gender roles, not as a declaration of intent. Again, expecting women to do all the work in freeing you is ridiculous and spoiled. Feminism gives you the opportunity to free yourself, not an obligation for women to do it for you. They have their own priorities.

Before Pangea, other 'clumps' were Vaalbara, Ur, Kenorland, Arctica, Atlantica, Nuna, Rodinia, Pannotia, Gondwana and Laurasia, and probably some others we don't know about.

I've had to deal with a coworker coming on to me in the past but luckily that guy didn't persue things for very long. Unfortunately it appears that this is starting to happen again, though. This new guy keeps asking me things about myself (and taking an unusual interest in what I respond) interspersed with talking about how he feels depressed/lacks self esteem/feels inadequate/etc. It's all very off-putting, honestly. He hasn't come out and asked me if I'm in a relationship with someone and I'm just not really comfortable with blurting out that I'm not single (and I get the feeling he'd just intensify the self pity talk).

519	"This hypothesis only goes so far when you factor in environmental events. Learned diseases like anxiety (e.g. Generalized Anxiety Disorder), as well as concepts taught in various fields (e.g. Quality Assurance, Crisis Counseling, and even basic scientific skepticism) all require the ability to transition outside of basic formulaic responses to handle unforeseen variables. Formulaic responses (e.g. algebraic math and other systems based primarily on rote memorization) are only as efficient as the system that evaluates their efficacy. 

Otherwise, pattern matching (no matter how complex) would elevate savants with otherwise debilitating mental deficits into the category of super-genius. The reality is that they're just hyper-efficient at understanding a certain set of logical patterns while being completely incapable of handling the larger segment of the world's problems.

I'd also argue that there's no statement in the paper on whether parallel searches are ongoing alongside the primary focus. Search depth could be shallow for the formulaic response and deep for a tangential response that's running just behind or tangentially to the primary focus. Or viceversa, there could be a deep search initially with multiple follow-up/parallel shallow searches that are given ""holding"" pattern treatments while the deep search runs its course.

Now, what this finding does imply (my own wild speculation) is that more intelligent humans have a neurological architecture that's optimized to complete certain pathways ahead of or after a larger pruning event without losing track of the data completely. Essentially, their neuronal pathways have been built around faster completion of formulas (by virtue of having fewer halting points for data input/output) until it hits a different threshold of completion than the average individual (aka parsing larger chunks of ""true"" data before going to the next calculation). 

Truly intelligent people would then be individuals who can both quickly chunk data into a solution and then discern where to apply either the formula's methodology or solution outside the scope of its initial bounds ahead of other individuals (e.g. they aren't making logical leaps, but rather connecting the dots between disparate formulas at a far more prodigious rate).

Or remember prohibition? Or prohibition again of marijuana?

You should really re-evaluate the standard of morality and ethics you hold yourself to. Willful ignorance and the complicit spread of incorrect information is super damaging for any society. 

It’s also ethically and morally disgusting.

BUT HELL TO EACH THEIR OWN, RIGHT?

Well, honestly, no one will care if you PERSONALLY choose to be stubborn and believe something without researching it or forming a legitimate opinion based on critical thinking. The problem is, just like freedom of speech, when your opinion becomes damaging to those around you, you are not only being willfully ignorant you’re causing harm to real people.

So, in closing:
1. Keep your uneducated and completely arbitrary opinions to yourself before you hurt someone. 
2. Think critically, do some research on morality and ethics, and reevaluate who you want to be in this society. Teach yourself how to change your opinion based on fact. Once you establish a factual and accurate opinion, THEN share it with people."	apple	sex	-1

556	"The ""let"" syntax is the equivalent of C's type declarations.

In C, you might write:

    int x = 1;

In rust, you write:

    let x = 1;

and let the compiler figure it out.

Having a separate syntax for declarations vs mutations is really nice because it makes it very explicit whether you are creating a new variable or modifying an existing one. This is especially important because variables in rust are immutable by default, so you also need to specify if a variable is mutable when you declare it."

The reason isn’t because they don’t know how to report critically on energy — they do regularly when it comes to non-renewable energy sources — but rather because they don’t want to.

I think this is an important point, but also one that doesn't tell the whole story. The article ignores the negative externalities of traditional energy sources which renewables don't cause.

What exactly are you doing here again?

&gt;You have no figures and are making an incredibly bad analysis from the start by ignoring the cost of marketing (if you're gonna use the full sales profit, you have to count marketing despite the reason you used being ""it's their choice"" which is asinine in and of itself in there because those sales would be far lower without it, that's just ridiculous to do) and assuming a $60 game sells for a $60 profit. Even if it comes directly through the publishing company they will never get the full price, from the discussion I've seen it goes between 90% being a best case and generally the profit is more around 50%-60% of the base cost.

No one has figures because they won't share them. Yet claim we're wrong and definitely don't provide the data to prove it. If they have the data to prove their claims, why don't they provide it?

And lets not forget digital sales accounting for a shitton of almost pure profits. They only make about 60% of the money from games sold at retailers. About 90% from digital as you mentioned. And don't forget I left out a whole million sales.

&gt;I've said it already, but this is stupid. I won't even entertain that notion. Marketing is critical to reaching, ya know, the market. That thing that you say lets them easily make profit. The fallacious thing is using titles like Pubg and Hellblade to say ""see you don't need marketing"" when they are the exception and not the rule. I mean honestly, that is incredibly asinine. I'm actually annoyed that you're actually even arguing this, you should never use this line of reasoning in the context of this argument, and certainly not when you use extremely generous estimates off of sales figures which were significantly aided through marketing efforts. I mean for fuck's sake.

How they decide to market the game is entirely up to them. If they are a competent company, they are spending exactly as much marketing as they feel is profitable for them. If they can't handle their own resources, they deserve to fucking go out of business. Its a non point.

&gt;It's risk aversion, stop using moralistic terms and judgments, that's a different discussion. You cannot chalk up to greed when every company that's successful avoids risks, they still funded a third title despite underperforming and that one didn't do nearly as well as the second.

Except its really not. You can't justify extreme things like this as just plain risk aversion. The industry functioned just fine with far less profits, its idiotic to think that suddenly it changed.

&gt; Minecraft especially merchandizes massively

Merchanidizing is entirely different than MTX. And if you think it needs those to be profitable... lol

And Fortnite is a F2P game. 

Please tell me about struggling indie devs that need MTX, tell me specifically which ones. The games I mentioned aren't exactly struggling games trying to make it by.

And you literally can't justify ""oh we're making over twice as much as we put in"" as a failure, no matter how much of a spin you try to put on it. End of the day, there are record profits for games, excellent margins, before MTX even enter the equation.

They do *not* need MTX to pad their lines, they just want them.

I started playing nandgame. It's fun.

I had a question about RAM

In the (current) instructions, it says 

""cl (clock signal) synchronizes state changes. X is stored when cl=0, but emitted only when cl changes to 1.""

However, when you go to complete the level it seems to contradict this. 

My understanding of the statement is, when cl=0, the value of d is stored (depending on the address and store) in it's appropriate register. WHen cl ticks to 1 (cl=1) then whatever the current address is, is emitted to the output. so if ad=0, st=1, d=5, and cl=0, you should store 5 in register 0, but NOT output 5 (not emit 5 to the output). Then when you change cl to 1, cl=1, with the same ad, then you get 5 as the output.

However, the level complete seems to mark this as incorrect. If ad=0, st=1, d=4, it doesn't start with cl=0, it jumps straight to cl=1. So if you build your gates such that you first need a clock of 0, the solution won't work. 

I guess my confusion is, when cl=0, it seems like the value of X should be stored as the value in the register. Am I correct in this understanding?"

694	"A hologram is a ""smart"" diffraction grating. When you make a hologram, you capture the interference pattern between your target object/scene and a reference source of illumination in one plane. 

Shining a similar source through the hologram recreates the original interference pattern. This reproduces a 3D view of the object you can see through the ""window"" of the hologram. 

Some holograms are reflective. Sometimes the object/scene appears in front of the hologram instead of behind it. 

But the basic idea is the same - the hologram diffracts/reflects light to capture and reproduce the light rays you'd see being reflected from a real object in a hemisphere around the holographic plate. 

You can only record a hologram with coherent light. If you use broadband light, you get a 2D sum of the colours in the plane instead of a diffraction pattern which projects the light into 3D.

The US was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic ties with Pakistan. We used Pakistan against the USSR, and later on as a sort of a ""forward base"" for many things in the area, Afgan shenanigans included. 

That pushed India further towards the USSR than we would have liked. But they stayed neutral all things considered.

IMO one of the reasons we loved Pakistan so much was not only because of their location, but their more authoritarian government and the fact that they're a smaller country right next to India. India can become a major force, Pakistan will never challenge the US. We like propping up small countries as allies to counter major regional powers. 

But really, in hindsight, if we knew India would have stayed neutral and how much we could have benefited economically bilaterally, and the fact that a modern and strong India would have been a very effective counter to China right now.

699	"I could give a very long answer, but I'll keep it short. 

1. Ethiopia as it exists is a very young country, only [a couple decades old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Civil_War). Since then, it has had [regular political unrest](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/28/589090717/in-ethiopia-bitter-social-conflict-plays-out-on-the-soccer-field) and continuous issues of [government corruption](https://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/ethiopia/). 
2. Economically, politically, and socially, Ethiopia has faced [ instability](http://addisstandard.com/commentary-ethiopias-unstable-political-landscape-unstable-region/) as different factions keep trying to take control of the resources of the country. There is good likelihood that artifacts recovered will be sold off to highest bidders. 
3. Some say ""Well Addis Ababa is very civilized and modern, these should be safe there!"" to which I note that the government has randomly arrested [journalists, teachers, and other political dissidents](https://www.opride.com/2018/03/27/massive-crackdown-overshadows-political-reform-and-new-prime-minister-election-in-ethiopia/) and will seize people's property if they find it valuable. So giving it to universities or private entities alike will not guarantee it stays there. 
4. Lastly, Ethiopia has made MANY human rights violations in recent years, and have [indescriminately killed](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/ethiopia) citizens in the hundreds. 


So to those who say ""They should have the artifacts because they're brown"" I would argue that my priority is not with the color of skin or even cultural heritage, but on ensuring that artifacts significant to humanity be kept safe. 

If they can be kept safe in Addis Ababa, then by all means send them there. But we have VERY good reason to believe they will not be safe there.

That’s not because women are bad with money. To oversimplify, it’s because traditionally women are the ones responsible for running the household.

I'm on my second marriage and I think I'm actually experiencing it with her now, but NEVER with my previous wife or girlfriends.  It was just such a common thing for me, how could it possibly have ever felt special?  People may argue and they may be right for them, but think of it like this...if you kissed 100 people many times, how hard is it to kiss the 101st?  That's what it was like for me.  Doesn't mean sex isn't still fantastic, it is, but I wish it had more of that deep emotional bond that people talk about.

706	There will always be a new phone coming out. If you phone is unusable now, I say get there pixel 2 XL now. 	"Saw there were tons of responses for getting through the month but had a couple ideas that might help in the slightly longer term. 

First: Check out Dollar Tree and check out some of their frozen foods. Dollar Tree does take TANF according to the signs they post at the ones I've seen. They have a variety of frozen veggies, some of which you can get at Walmart for similar prices, but their frozen fruit is a lot cheaper than you can get elsewhere. Their canned goods are not always cheaper, so write down prices from other stores and compare. Dollar Tree has the cheapest peanut butter, bagels and bread I know of. Google to find information about starting a ""price book"" to keep track of grocery sales. Depending what you are looking for, there are some things cheaper at Wegmans. 

Second: Start a garden to add nutrition to the basic rice/beans/eggs. Veggies are a better choice to add nutrition than trying to step up to buy meat instead of just beans/eggs. You can do this (on a smaller scale) even in most apartments. I grew a garden pretty successfully on a Virginia second floor balcony. One of the other posts sounded like you were in Maryland. When I was in Northern Virginia, early Feb would be a good time to start seeds indoors. Dollar Tree also has seed packets for $.25, and now would be the time to buy. I think Walmart's cheapest seeds start at $.99. I *think* some states do allow you to buy seeds with TANF money. Try spinach and lettuce right now to put outside once they sprouted, and tomatoes to start seeds inside to put outside in a couple months. But tomatoes need big containers with a lot of soil (5 gallon buckets at minimum), and soil can get expensive. But if you have a house with a garden, then tomatoes are easier to do. Sugar snap peas are another good choice for this time of year, but I haven't seen seeds for those in Dollar Tree. Use any plastic storage container you have (that has never held chemicals) to plant in, and poke holes in the bottom with a nail or kitchen knife. Start seeds in egg cartons.  Wash some milk jugs out well and cut off the top half. Nowadays, people start seeds out of store-bought sterile seed starter soil, but my mom used to take regular garden soil and put it in a baking pan in the oven for a while. She said it stunk up the house though. You may also want to post to gardenweb.com in the mid-atlantic gardening forum and see if anyone has extra seeds or would start a couple extra veggie seedlings for you. Serious gardeners often start far more seeds than they need, then keep the best for themselves and give the others away. 

Third: Asian and Hispanic grocery stores. If you are within 45 miles of DC (where most of Maryland's population is) then there are probably some Asian and Hispanic groceries near you. Asian groceries usually have cheaper vegetables than your typical American grocery store and many things are cheaper than Walmart/Aldi. Hispanic groceries are worth checking out if you are doing price comparisons on large bags of beans/rice, and their spices (in bags) are often cheaper, if you can't find what you are looking for at Aldi's/Dollar Tree/the bottom row in Walmart's spices.

Fourth: Budget recipe ideas.  Buy a big thing of sweet potatoes, cut into large french fries, and bake in oven. Dust with cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice if you feel like getting fancy. Should please your son as something that usually would be more of a treat. Pancakes (with cheap flour and eggs) with frozen/canned fruit would be another idea. If you do have chicken thighs occasionally, save the leftover thigh bones, put them in a baggie in the freezer and make chicken stock from them when you've got a dozen or so. You can turn chicken stock and beaten eggs into egg drop soup as another cheap meal. Hot dogs can be cheap. One of my favorites as a kid was Rancher's skillet. Hot dogs chopped into bite sized pieces, along with tomato sauce and beans. Mom usually put green beans but kidney beans were more to my liking. Cabbage is usually your cheapest winter vegetable. Try a cabbage stir-fry or cabbage soup (usually with tomato sauce). It's too low calorie to be a meal if you weren't dieting, but it would be a filling side dish. Oatmeal. I used to buy big things of oatmeal, mix with applesauce or peanut butter, sometimes cinnamon or raisins then bake for a healthy snack bar. 

Fifth: Processed and pre-made snack foods aren't that frugal. While cornflakes and breakfast cereal may seem cheaper than some other foods, oatmeal and eggs are some of the cheapest foods you can get. Any pre-made, pre-proportioned snack foods for lunches probably are relatively expensive. Try PB&amp;J  sandwiches with cookie cutters, or huge bags of pretzels and put into baggies. Raisins would be a lot healthier than Gushers. "	Android	Frugal	-1
707	"Kids here get into daycare by age 1 at the latest (that's when they're guaranteed a place, but it's possible to get them in earlier). It means both parents can go back to work after they've both taken their parental leaves, and the kids definitely gain from it from a developmental perspective.

They socialize with other children and build relationships to adults, they get incredibly many opportunities to develop all kinds of gross and fine motor skills; staying at home (in a nourishing environment, obviously) is by no means detrimental to these skills early on, but one simply can not provide the same quantity and variety of experience as a good daycare can.

Really the only ""counterargument"" I can think of is in case of children who might be flooded in daycare if they're introduced to it too early (either insecure-difficult or slow children), but in those cases it should be a goal to work towards introducing the child to daycare.

In my opinion, it's the natural thing to do nowadays... Women have (pretty much) always had aid in raising children in one form or another.

"DoR is probably my favorite take on the series. As a long-time fan, many of the small quality of life improvements were really appreciated - especially the naval and air force changes which made them far more accessible in the early/ mid-game economy, and more functional on the battlefield. There were still a few lingering balance issues surrounding things like anti-tank which felt shoe-horned in, but it generally worked.

The story mode was a nice touch and worked well for the game with its character ensemble ""anime-esc"" plot. It made for some really creative missions. Unfortunately, the characters weren't quite as charming and memorable due to the way the game was fundamentally structured. Only the core starter characters stand out.

That said, I doubt we'll ever see another game like, nor should we, precisely because the comedic tone of the franchise was a key part of its identity and ditching it for a dark post-apocalyptic war story simply hurt the game's appeal.

The primary problem in here is the department, and by extension the municipality or county or state, is looking to insulate themselves from liability.

"I believe what /u/succulent_headcrab meant was that it's weird the study felt it necessary to mention they contacted police, it should be a given and isn't relevant to the study in any way

As for the study itself the mentioning of the deaths as a side note feels dubious (as we understand).

The count of 36 patients isn't exactly a representative sample size for anything, especially since only 7 ingested just cannabis while 29 also had ""other ingredients"" which could mean anything without sifting through their sources.

That graph is laughable in how little it actually tells and the information explaining it doesn't help either ""The evolution is favorable in most cases (92%).only one nursling was admitted to intensive care for altered case of consciousness with respiratory distress. two deaths were noted""  
They don't explain what ""good"" ""intensive care"" and ""death"" means, presumably the ""good"" patients didn't need to come to the hospital at all and the 3 others obviously did but without any further explanation of the patients the deaths and intensive care could as much be caused by existing problems being exacerbated by the cannabis high as it is just the cannabis itself. For example if a child dies from an asthma attack brought on by peanut allergy it isn't fair to peanuts to claim they are fatal in children.

Also going through the references I'm not sure what the references were used for given that the this is a descriptive study from a certain hospital during a certain period while the references are all from different time periods and locations.

This isn’t something I can control, but also something I can’t function at all with at times.  If I don’t take meds, and I’ve trialed many, taken breaks, reintroduced, cycled through, etc., it’s a matter of time before I end up with thoughts like, “I wish death would come find me.”  Depression and Bipolar disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, these disorders will take over your life and not allow you to even see that they have.  There are patterns to these disorders, and there have been enough people who come for help with these types of mental health problems that they have been able to categorize them in the DSM.  Thus, like diabetes has symptoms, so does Depression.  All of these disorders hijack executive function, concentration, sleep, appetite.  Even if my OCD was a variant of normal, I cannot live a normal life when it’s really bad.  I begin to question everything.  One good book for you to read might be the Noonday Demon.  This helped me back off of the type of warpath you’re on.   	travel	conspiracy	-1

Then I would wake up around 1 or 2am and remain awake reading or doing things throughout the night. There's very few distractions being awake at that time and I managed to get a ton of reading done, then I would gradually get ready for work and go in at the usual time having already been up for 6-7 hours. It worked well during the winter but it was also very lonely and precluded me joining some social functions. The only reason I tried it was due to my existing sleep issue and I thought that if I simply sleep when my body wants, then I will reliably not waste time and fall asleep, instead of tossing and turning when trying to force myself into a regimented work/sleep schedule.

Ultimately, after consulting with my doctor, I am now forcing myself up even when tired, trying not to nap as much, and hopefully that will cause me to be reliably exhausted by normal bedtime standards. I get up if I can't sleep and never spend more than 30 minutes laying there sleepless.

Delta activity is strongest in the frontal cortex where much of the mental activity of the brain occurs.  If you put a person's hand on a vibrating platform so that you stimulate the somatosensory cortex corresponding to the hand, you will see increased delta activity in that same region of the brain.  If you take a person out for a stimulating day, they will have increased slow wave sleep.

796	"As a current graduate student I definitely agree. Academic writing is inherently built off of a wider knowledge set and takes a specific theoretical approach, which is usually explicitly stated in an article but not explained in depth. It can’t be for the sake of brevity but the sources are always listed right there. Academic reading/ research is similar to getting caught in a YouTube wormhole. The sources snowball into a general knowledge set. Reading a single article alone can be like flipping to a random page in a novel and taking it as a complete work. It won’t make a lot of sense.

All that jargon and nitpicking over seemingly trivial definitional understandings can certainly seem like elitism. Which, in a sense it is. Most people don’t have the time, interest, access, or finances needed to get deeply involved in academic literature. It’s a luxury no doubt. But that doesn’t denigrate it’s importance. Academia can reflect society but also steer its course. I think of universities as high concentration areas of knowledge/ideas, and those ideas diffuse out to lower concentration areas or society more generally. The diffusion can be direct i.e most of my professors are also intimately involved with political organizations (I study public policy), or the academic origin of the data analysis used by Cambridge Analytica. It can also be indirect, i.e. policy makers using academic research to inform decisions or journalists relying on academia to argue a particular point or back up their own investigations. I think journalists and policy actors have a responsibility to accurately understanding and representing academic research. If academic’s are the gatekeepers of information as argued, then journalists are the smugglers, the fence-hoppers, who bring that information to the public, and as such have a lot of power over the flow of that information and how it’s used. 

I’m coming from a social sciences perspective but I think the same is true for ‘hard’ sciences. Scientific data is easily manipulated or misrepresented if not explained fully, something media outlets seem to do fairly frequently. A good example of the subtly of this process is the climate change debate as it has played out in the U.S. media. The journalistic commitment to fair and balanced coverage, fundamental to good reporting, resulting in undue attention given to the minority of scientific skepticism of climate change. This (among many other things) encouraged a wider public skepticism of climate change, and a lack of political action on the issue. Media representation of academic knowledge is a really important issue I think.

To be clear though I really respect the work of good journalists. It can be really in depth and personal in a way academia often can’t. But it also needs to stay true to the academic knowledge set in my opinion.

Sorry for going on a bit of a rant but I’m just super interested in knowledge flows especially in our increasingly big-data driven world. Information is the new currency."	"I'm like rubber, you're like glue. Whatever you say, bounces off of me and sticks to you!

And I mention it because this situation falling apart isn't all on him. Everyone on reddit is siding with you because you're asking the question, but it sure sounds like he's had to live alone without the love and support of his partner for basically 6 months while he slipped further and further into gaming addiction, with no friends and no help, while you gave him stuff to do.  That's really hard position to be in.  If you think he was the only bad guy in this situation, you're just going to end up here all over again with someone else.  If you HAVE to be long distance with your partner, you have to talk and connect and bond, even if you have to do it over email.  You can't just be their task master.  

Your partner needed a human connection and you gave him a checklist.  He did fuck up in some major ways, but a part of this is on you.  From his perspective, he's probably been miserable and lonely (while cultivating an addiction that is in many ways as bad for you as alcoholism), and then when you finally came back after 6 months you pestered him about the dogs, which he was probably already stressed about.  

You guys need to go your separate ways, but you should strongly *strongly* encourage him to get help for his gaming addiction.

You don't need mass to have momentum. There is no reason for that other than ""that's the equation we know from newtonian mechanics"". In relativity, particles without mass have momentum p=E/c  


You can calculate the momentum of light from Maxwells equations and it's nothing new. People have known that light carries momentum since forever (actually since maxwell) and we use that fact to predict a lot of stuff. I haven't read the article but I'm sure it's more than just ""we saw light has momentum"" because that has been known for decades or even centuries.  


To expand a little bit, momentum is a conserved quantity in translational invariant systems. In particular cases, which correspond to everyday massive non-relativistic particles, you get that it's p=mv, in other cases it's not. The actual definition of momentum is based on other concepts in physics (the Lagrangian)."	nba	science	-1

"How very interesting! *Archaeopteryx* and *Deinonychus* are both members of the dinosaur group named ""Paraves"" or ""near-birds"". Within that group, *Deinonychus* falls within the dromaeosaurs (also called ""raptors""), whereas *Archaeopteryx* is part of the other group, the ""Avialiae"".

Your professor's example is indeed very relevant, since it was exactly that line of reasoning that brought Prof. Ostrom in the 1970's to conclusion that a century-long old theory which had received little attention but is accepted today, namely that birds are dinosaurs, may actually be true!

If you look at the wrist of *Deinonychus*, you will find that the hand connects to the arm with a half-moon-shaped bone, which is also called exactly that (semi-lunate carpal). This bone allowed *Deinonychus* to sweep its hand to the side, which we ourselves cannot do. *Archaeopteryx* also had this bone, and in modern birds it is preserved as a similarly-shaped portion of a fused bone: the carpometacarpus. Exactly this anatomical aspect allows birds to fold their wings along their sides and over their back. Because it is present in both the raptors and the Avialiae, we suspect it was also present in the shared ancestor of those groups.

Having a lot of people willing to work for peanuts will take you some of the way, but they're not going to manage to be a ""dominant economic superpower"" for very long while maintaining a communist dictatorship. And GDP doesn't tell the whole story. Not to get all rah-rah-America on you, but personal freedom, free markets, and the rule of law really are crucial to our success and I believe anyone else that wants to sideline us. China's strategy is not self-sustaining. It's doubtful they can maintain an economy as vibrant as our own without these things, and they're very dependent on our trade/IP. I would fear more from India (very) long-term, for all its problems right now. I don't think we should get complacent or not worry that China might adopt a more aggressive military posture, but for straight up economic competition, the Western world will continue to dominate long after 2029 even if China's GDP (propped up by 4x as many people) technically overtakes the US's, barring the unforeseen. China's government will either need to be radically reformed or overthrown in order for them to truly compete with us, and if it's not, they'll likely strangle their own progress eventually by trying to centrally plan things to maintain their grip on power."

866	"Let us use the EU as a substitute for California.  If all of Germany votes liberal, and all of France votes Conservative, and all of Italy votes 50/50, then the votes come out pretty even.  However, under what you are proposing, France must send one liberal and one conservative, Germany must send one liberal and one conservative, and Italy must send one liberal and one conservative.  Doesn't seem fair to the individual nations.  They chose how they wanted to be represented.

Either that, or since Germany has all of the liberals, and France has all of the conservatives, the conservative representing Italy is sent from France, and the liberal representing Italy is sent from Germany.   This way would have Italy not being represented for its needs.

So, instead, we let the localities picked their own representatives and send them to fight it out.

The good news is that in the case of California, the lines are a bit more flexible, as we wish to balance for population.... IE: no representative has more or fewer constituents.  The better news is that the elected officials do not draw those lines in California.  An independent council does in order to ensure fairness.

The bad news is that the rest of the country has yet to catch up with the independent council idea.  Thus we have some places that democrats have fudged the line in their favor a bit and a whole fucking lot of places republicans have fudged the numbers a lot in their favor.

Now, you must also consider that states like California are much more varied in climates and industry and economic needs and a slew of other factors than most of Europe combined.  There are areas like Great Britain, there are some like Southern Italy, there are some like the Alps region, and there are areas that are like Northern Africa.

[The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus) allows us to use integrals to construct antiderivatives to any nice function that you can ""easily graph"". For instance, an antiderivative of sin(x)/x is the function Si(x) that outputs the integral from 0 to x of (sin(t)/t)dt. This is a function, it is differentiable and its derivative is sin(x)/x (due to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus), so it is an antiderivative of sin(x)/x. This is the [Sine Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_integral#Sine_integral).

Now, it doesn't have an antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. We should expect this kind of thing to happen fairly often. It is analogous to squares and integers. With integers, you can explicitly compute N^(2) for any integer N. This is thanks to the niceness of multiplication, which gives us algorithms to compute it efficiently. But, given an integer N, it is much harder to solve the equation x^(2)=N explicitly. In fact *most of the time* the solution to this equation is not itself an integer, even though we started with one. We can compute this solution, using roots, but we often leave the real of nice-simple-easy numbers and get into irrational numbers.

If we have an elementary function f(x), then the Chain Rule and Product Rule allow us to easily and explicitly compute the derivative f'(x). But, given a function f(x), it is must harder to solve the equation y'=f(x). A solution to this is like taking a square root, sometimes, if you're lucky, you get a solution that is also an elementary function, but most of the time you should expect the solution to be an ""irrational function"" (or, non-elementary). But, just like roots, a solution usually exists. For square roots we apply the square root to get an irrational solution. For function we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to get ""irrational solutions""."	todayilearned	askscience	-1

He was doing that thing where he doesn't initiate conversations or talk to me unless I initiated things and he didn't tell me anything was bothering him when I asked him if everything was okay until I was wondering what was going on and asked him what was going on with us, why there was distance between us. We got in a huge, nasty fight, I cried my eyes out, we haven't talked since. We were friends for over 10years. He's apparently fine with the way things are now. I'm not.

928	"I made a previous post on it, but it takes way too long to start matches for how short they are. I spend more time out of matches in queue, going through menus to pick my stuff before a match (every single time), and waiting on others than actually playing the game. Sometimes you wait like 10 minutes to get into a match, it starts, and then it ends within a minute... or you know, you get a very laggy, unfun one. This could've been easily solvable with a rematch button, longer matches, remembering my decisions on my setups without me having to confirm them, faster queues... but they won't be in the final game. The longest a match can go is like 6 minutes at best, and if this time limit is hit, both teams lose. The technical issues this game has are going to drag it down badly.

As for the actual gameplay, it's a bit stale. Some characters have interesting mechanics (at least on paper) but that's about the extent of it. They took a 1v1 game, made it 3v3, and then had it run over more than just an adhoc connection. The game is slower, clunkier, less complex, and less fun. You get hit with an HP attack and you are forced into a hard knockdown which feels like an eternity, you do attacks with huge recovery times to them... it's really barebones attempting to trade blows with another person. The optimal strategy is switching targets nonstop to attempt to blindside people that may not see your attack coming and protect your allies by abusing the opponent's long recovery windows to strike them. That's not fun. It feels like you're playing a super sluggish underwater version of the original game. That game definitely could've used some revisions to the general flow of combat and changes to shake it up, but this is not what was desired.

The class system also forces characters into specific ""roles"" that limits creativity and makes them all not on even footing with one another. Characters are good at doing very specific things, they play a role, sort of like a MOBA... but this game doesn't have the depth or interesting gameplay that a MOBA has. It just ends up feeling shallow, especially with how short the matches are. The characters are also very dumbed down compared to the old game in many cases. This can be attributed to the 3v3 combat but also what I'm guessing are budget/time constraints on design and implementation. Characters like Golbez are stripped down to what the community refers to as a ""ball mage"" where they just throw very simple orbs of elements at enemies, with varying speeds and tracking; it is barely functional/interesting gameplay. Many mage characters are like this. Not only is there very minimal skillcap, but the gameplay and decision making is only barely there.

Lastly, summons are an unbalanced mechanic that feel tacked on more than anything. There's a few summons that everyone seems to choose because they are the best (yes, even in Japan), and you see them over and over again every match. The same exact (unskippable) summoning cutscene happens every time, then it does a bunch of random AoEs that have to be dodged while giving a buff to the team that bothered to do it. It's important, it's good, but I don't feel like it adds anything to the gameplay. The goal seemed to be to add an alternative objective for the teams to fight over, but with how short the matches are, it doesn't feel very rewarding or interesting.

I'm a fan of Final Fantasy, and I was a big fan of the original Dissidia. I play a lot of fighting games, MOBAs, and other team games. I didn't really mind the transition they were doing to 3v3; it just seemed like an interesting way of taking the game. However, after playing it, I've all but decided not to purchase it. There is fun to be had, but the technical constraints hold it back hard, and it's nigh impossible to convince any of my friends to deal with them to play it with me. Add that all on top of what is terrible timing to release the game with games like Monster Hunter and DBZ releasing... I'm sad to say this is probably a pass."	I really don´t feel like there are too many bugs. GTA probably has more bugs and is out for much longer, yet no one gives a shit. If the game isn´t a complete shithole I can accept a few bugs in a released game because EVERY game has bugs in it, early access or not. Witcher 3 at release had more bugs than PUBG right now.

It's authoritarianism, first and foremost, and in terms of looking out for the majority of people, it's just a middle ground between European style liberal democracy and Russian style kleptocracy. It might be communitarian, but it's still highly oligarchical, I'd argue likely due to really heavily ingrained Confucian ideals of filial piety and loyalty. The government is trying to increase prosperity of all citizens (at least, citizens it deems ""important"", ie predominantly Han people in the east, as opposed to ethnic minorities in the west/south), but only in that it recognizes that failure to provide for those it rules is a threat to stability, and stability is valued over all things. 

I get that it's more communitarian as opposed to individualistic. But at the same time, I think the ""left vs right"" divide has a lot more to it than just individualism vs communitarianism (at root, anyway). 

Besides, you could argue that there are places like South America that are extremely leftist, yet the socialism-fostering aspects of culture there are strongly tied to or supported by the Church, at least locally (see; liberation theology) and how"	videos	worldnews	-1

932	"this is an example of why people good at dealing with technical problems are not good at dealing with social problems. they get so used to buttressing their logic with assumed invariants that they are completely adrift in situations where everything is negotiable and inter-connected.

so for example, one false invariant he's relying on is that idea that criminals are in jail for good reason. this is not true. people are in jail because the state doesn't like their behavior. sometimes it's legit (like murder) sometimes it's not (like being a communist). so what he thinks he's advocating is ""bad people can't have kids"" but what he's really advocating is ""i want the state to be able to arbitrarily sterilize people"".

another one is he's relying on the idea that people with mental problems are accurately diagnosed by people without agendas. the soviet union was especially known for having psychiatrists diagnose political rivals of the party as mentally ill and then involuntarily committed.

another one is that he relies on the idea that ""desirable parents"" is at all definable and that society's idea would be congruous with his. again not the case at all.

people who can deal with toy problems with very defined rules and boundaries are extremely bad at setting policy. this is also why ""just let scientists rule the world"" is an awful awful awful idea. so as a practical takeaway from this: *do not ever let a systems-level engineer in charge of any human being or policy ever*"	"I think the implication is the opposite, however. 
If people really felt that masculinity is truly toxic, then they would say that masculinity were at fault rather than toxic masculinity, a term that would seem redundant to them. Putting the word ""toxic"" before the word seems to be a concession that masculinity comes in many types, some good and some bad. 

If someone actually hated the issues that appear in some black communities, they would call it blackness rather than toxic blackness, which is what happened in the past.

Also, let's remind ourselves that the Nazis referred to ""Jewishness"" rather than putting ""toxic"" in front of it.

With all that in mind, ""toxic _____"" seems to be a friendlier phrase, meant to be constructive rather than to attack a group."	todayilearned	MensRights	-1
933	"Vaping won't get you the same high from taking gravity bong rips in my opinion. Vapes can produce a more ""cleaner"" feeling high"	"The purpose of the 25th is for something like when a sitting President undergoes surgery or is in a temporary coma or something like that.  It may even apply to when he's been attacked or injured in an accident.  The idea is that *something* has occurred that has *incapacitated* the President.  Before the 25th amendment, this scenario would have been a constitutional crisis in the sense that succession or what to do was ill-defined.  The 25th provides a mechanism to figure out what to do.  But that's why it's both immediate and temporary.  The need is to get someone acting as President immediately.  But the entire context of the problem being solved is a temporary thing.  The President doesn't cease being President, per se.  It's just that the VP slides into ""acting"" President immediately.

This was never meant to be what to do if the President has slid into dementia or whatever.

To be frank, you could consider that scenario to remain as ill-defined.

But be that as it may, with impeachment and the 25th we do have two courses of action available: impeachment and the 25th.  Both are clearly defined.  There's no doubt what to do.  There's no reason for either to be entertained by any lower court to say nothing of the SCOTUS.

In any case, if your goal is permanent removal of Trump (no matter the motive) then using the 25th is silly.  It will *never* result in permanent removal.  Kinda silly to stage a coup if every four weeks you have to ask permission to continue with the coup.  Furthermore, if you already have the support in Congress for impeachment and removal then just do that.  The support required just to keep the president out for another four weeks via the 25th is **greater** than that required for impeachment and removal.

What was troublesome about your earlier post was due to the stated motive being out of sync with how the 25th works.  If your goal is some strange corrupt removal of a President to push forward an alternative government then the 25th doesn't work for that goal.  The President becomes ""temporarily relived of duties"" and the VP becomes ""acting President"".  That's the *only* change and it's temporary.

As far as I can tell, there's another problem with the 25th that might arise.  Say the cabinet does this and then while Pence is ""acting"", Pence dies or is killed.  What in the world happens then?  What should happen then is the President appoints a new VP which is ratified by both houses of Congress.  But if the President were truly incapacitated... then what?

Next, you seemed to be suggesting Mueller's investigation would be closed after this cabal takes over.  Invoking the 25th wouldn't change anything unless you believe that Pence would immediately do what Trump hasn't yet - fire Sessions and Rosenstein, etc.

If that's what you believe, I'll retract the ""nonsense"" claim.  I remain unpersuaded.  But that idea is indeed possible and may merit consideration.

Lastly, as much as it pains me to say this, your determination of Trump's ""unfitness"" is essentially just your opinion - one I share, by the way.  But if the US electorate **chose** this, appealing to the 25th isn't our best bet.  If the voters wanted someone who acts like this, then a democracy is going to give them what they want.  Our real battle is to convince the Congress that we (the entire electorate) really don't continue to want this.  Then, and likely only when that's clear, will they finally move for impeachment."	science	politics	-1

"Why shouldn't they? Rich people being rich doesn't make the poor worse off. What ought to be of concern is the standard of living those in poverty have.

935	"According to the research I've done, Disney still had a 70%+ market share on the Orlando theme park industry in February 2015. That constitutes a large monopoly and dominant presence. Statistics also show that it takes, and took, several years for Universal to even gain a few to several percent in the same market share, due to Disney's monopoly.

Even then, the main reason for Universal's success, and increased market share, was solely due to the building of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park expansion(s). Before WWOHP's existence, the Universal theme parks had been badly underfunded and poorly managed, neglected by the brand's parent companies. 

&gt; In terms of market share, Disney remains dominant, with 71.2%. But is has lost nearly 4% since 2009 to Universal, which increased its market share from 16% to 21.6% [by 2015].

As for ""doing anything unsavory or illegal"", Disney literally directly copied J.K. Rowling's management of, and approach to, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (WWOHP) at Universal Studios / Islands of Adventure in Orlando.

&gt;Facebook today responded to user comments and concerns about privacy by announcing it will introduce simpler and more powerful controls for sharing personal information. New settings will give the more than 400 million people who use Facebook the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share, all with just a few simple clicks. In addition, new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third-party applications or websites.

&gt;“When we started Facebook, we built it around a few simple ideas,” said Zuckerberg. “When people have control over what they share, they want to share more. When people share more, the world becomes more open and connected. Over the past few weeks, the number one thing we’ve heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information. Today we’re starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier.”

Even if our record on privacy were perfect, I think many people would still rightfully question how their information was protected.

&gt;**January 26, 2017: Introducing the New Privacy Basics**

&gt;Today we’re introducing a new Privacy Basics to make it easier for people to find tools for controlling their information on Facebook.

&gt;We’re making these improvements as part of Data Privacy Day, held each year on January 28. We’re joining state attorneys general and other policymakers who are sharing their own privacy information on Facebook, along with organizations around the world like National Cyber Security Alliance, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology, who are working to raise awareness of how to take charge of your information online.

&gt;**January 28, 2018: Giving You More Control of Your Privacy on Facebook**

&gt;As part of Data Privacy Day, we’re introducing a new education campaign to help you understand how data is used on Facebook and how you can manage your own data. We’re also announcing plans to make your core privacy settings easier to find, and sharing our privacy principles for the first time. These principles guide our work at Facebook.

&gt;Facebook was built to bring people closer together. We help you connect with friends and family, discover local events and find groups to join. We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone – including with us. It’s important that you have choices when it comes to how your data is used. These are the principles that guide how we approach privacy at Facebook.

&gt;**May 11, 2012: Enhancing Transparency In Our Data Use Policy**

&gt;When we launched our redesigned Data Use Policy last year, our goal was to create a more transparent guide to how we use data when people use Facebook. We structured our policy to have a layered design that puts the most important information up front but lets you click on particular topics to see more details. We believe this flexible, transparent format strikes the right balance between simplicity and accessibility.

#and this: 

&gt;**November 20, 2017: Enforcing Our Policies and Protecting People’s Data**

&gt;We’ve seen allegations that we don’t care how people’s data is used. While it’s fair to criticize how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy. The facts tell a different story.

&gt;We’ve listened to feedback from people who use Facebook, experts in privacy and security, and regulators on how we can do better. We’ve devoted hundreds of people and new technology to enforce our policies better and kick bad actors off our platform. To name just a few examples:

&gt;First, it’s always been against our policy for a developer to collect data it doesn’t need to operate its app. But in the past five years we’ve significantly improved our ability to detect and prevent these violations. All apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process where developers must explain how they are going to use what they collect – before they’re allowed to even ask for it.

&gt;Second, when developers are permitted to use our platform, we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time. We introduced this more than three years ago.

&gt;Third, we enforce our policies by banning developers from our platform, pursuing litigation to ensure any improperly collected data is deleted, and working with developers who want to make sure their apps follow the rules.

&gt;We’re not stopping here. Our privacy program, created in 2012, includes hundreds of people from a variety of teams across the company. This group works with product managers and engineers to protect people’s data, to give people information about how our features work, and to provide people control over how their data is used. This program is audited as part of a 20-year agreement we have with the US Federal Trade Commission. We’re held accountable for what we say and what we do.

&gt;Our approach reflects the laws and regulations we have to follow – both in the US and around the world – but it also reflects something more fundamental. *Facebook may be successful today, but our future isn’t guaranteed without the trust of the people who choose to come here every day.* It’s why we promote a culture inside Facebook that questions decisions and that is relentless in finding ways to improve. We’ll continue listening to feedback and finding ways we can do better.

At the end of the day, employees are valuable for the work they perform, not because they’re willing to go bowling with coworkers. Is it worth losing good employees because they don’t conform, they’re introverts, or they prefer keeping their work and personal lives separate? Part of diversity is having people with different personalities, and you’ll lose some of that when you expect everyone to socialize the same way. "	"I feel I need to preface this by saying that yes, I do understand that creepy guys looking for very young girls do exist, they're considered creepers for a reason, but that's not necessarily the case for everyone.

I didn't see much in the way of wider statistics in the article, but based on general demographics, wouldn't this just make logical sense and not necessarily just be able creepers trying to hookup with younger women? I don't have numbers and I could be completely wrong, but I would assume there are more *active* 18-25 year olds on dating sites than there are 30+ year olds of both genders, so people likely need to look for a younger partner out of necessity rather than just wanting someone young. There is also the matter of kids to factor in. If a man or woman is looking for a partner without kids, the pool of potential partners their age without kids diminishes the older they get.

Again, this is just an objective opinion, not trying to justify creepers."	business	OkCupid	-1

The moon was (based on current theories) formed by a large impact with the earth early in its life, which means the earth and moon are composed of the roughly same stuff. Since the moon is smaller and cooled faster, its less geologically active than the earth, so subduction doesnt happen there. We took samples of lunar rock and did the same radioisotope dating experiments.

&gt;You are presenting the false dichotomy of either working hard or learning about politics

I didn't present a dichotomy at all. And I didn't say anything about working hard. It's that the work is narrow and time-consuming, not that it is difficult. Getting a PhD in something like herpetology literally means you're spending &gt; 4 years (and typically &gt;6) of your life painstakingly confined to one niche field of study that has no relevance to politics, with very little opportunity to explore other domains. Now, there are some bright PhD students who do find the time to study other things (like politics), but by and large PhDs are extraordinarily time-consuming and energy-consuming. 70 hours a week of confined study is nothing trivial, especially when PhDs have concurrent commitments and are even working another job. 

Hypothetically, let's say a PhD student and a businessman are working the same hours. In business you are dealing face-to-face with politically-relevant matters: the economy, budgeting, social relationships, efficiency, et cetera. Although a limited amount of your job, it transfers to political understanding. But a PhD, in many cases, does not transfer to political understanding. History, *perhaps* English, perhaps philosophy (especially if continental), will definitely transfer to political understanding. But either a sizable minority or a majority of PhD studies do not. This means that even if a PhD and a businessman are working the same hours, the businessman is more likely to be acquainted with politically-relevant ideas or data. 

&gt;people need to learn to think critically which is encouraged in school where an instructor pushes an individual to think critically

I think you are overestimating how different it is to think critically about a political issue as opposed to thinking critically about an essay or an historical phenomena. This sort of ""thinking critically"" is grilled in every American for 12 years of primary education, and I think we can both agree that it hasn't been helping make politically-informed citizens.

1001	"i hung out with a really great girl. pretty, intelligent, talented at things i also was interested in, interesting to talk to, and she liked having me around.

one day (after maybe two years of knowing each other) i scrounged the courage to ask her out. before i got to actually say what i wanted, she figured it out and cut me off by saying she's engaged and will get married soon. i had my suspicions she saw what was coming, but she never gave me a hint of being in a relationship.

i could not take it and stopped talking to her. soon after her fiancee started visiting her at the univerisity and i just had to walk away from wherever i was to avoid the sight of them together. it was just too much. i never found the courage to ask another girl out, after being shot down like this. but somehow managed to get into a few decent relationships anyway.

later on, it turned out she was super religious. the kind of religious that not only goes to church every sunday but also participates in various festivities and helps organize them. that gave me some consolation, because that's not my cup of tea.

i got really burned by this one. and the next one as well. since then, i keep my emotions on a tight leash and whenever i feel like i am getting infatuated with someone, i step back and analyze the situation for whatever traps."

I needed a new farming/crafting fix after two years of **Stardew Valley.**  My Time at Portia is still in development, but if the devs flesh out the relationship and story aspects, it will easily be my new favourite relaxation game. I’ve played for 23 hours so far. 


Unlike Stardew, this game focuses on developing your workshop and helping your town. You craft items that allow you to explore a post-apocalyptic world, and develop your community’s infrastructure, like transit and lighting.  Farming is simplified, crafting is king -- you’ll be mining and logging and killing monsters for components, but you can also grow crops and raise animals on the side. To be fair, I just got two calfs, so I haven’t explored much of the animal stuff yet.   


There are dungeons with boss fights. Combat is somewhat more challenging than Stardew, although that’s not saying much.  Portia’s dungeons do have more interesting obstacles, like dodging giant boulders, but it’s not hard.


There are regular events that I won’t spoil here, only to say that they need to be fleshed out imo. I’ve read that players can romance certain NPCs, but I haven’t encountered that yet, and any kind of improved relationship or story elements would be greatly welcomed.  The dialogue needs improvement, and some lines fall incredibly flat. My Time at Portia is currently a rough sketch still being coloured in. 


This game feels super-grindy right now, possibly because the story is still being worked on.  Stardew Valley’s interpersonal aspects really made that game shine and gave it a charm that is currently missing in Portia. There are basic beginnings of a better story, as if the developers left anchors for future plot development. I really hope this is true, because that’s exactly what this game needs.

1016	"&gt;The ATF form that you fill out when purchasing or transfering a gun asks you questions about your mental health and if you use drugs including antidepressants

Uh, no. 

TL;DR you're only banned if you've been committed to an asylum or found mentally incompetent by a court. Drugs only matter if they're illegal, OR you're addicted to them. Legal prescription medication doesn't matter. 

Here's what it says:

11.e Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance? 
Warning: The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or 
decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.

11.f Have you ever been adjudicated as a mental defective OR have you ever been committed to a mental institution? (See Instructions for Question 
11.f.)

Question 11.f. Adjudicated as a Mental Defective: A determination by a court, 
board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked 
subnormal intelligence, or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease: (1) is 
a danger to himself or to others; or (2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or 
manage his own affairs. This term shall include: (1) a finding of insanity by a court 
in a criminal case; and (2) those persons found incompetent to stand trial or found not 
guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility. 
 
Committed to a Mental Institution: A formal commitment of a person to a mental 
institution by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority. The term 
includes a commitment to a mental institution involuntarily. The term includes 
commitment for mental defectiveness or mental illness. It also includes commitments 
for other reasons, such as for drug use. The term does not include a person in a 
mental institution for observation or a voluntary admission to a mental institution. 
 
EXCEPTION: Under the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, a person 
who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution 
in a State proceeding is not prohibited by the adjudication or commitment if the person has been granted relief by the adjudicating/committing State pursuant to 
a qualifying mental health relief from disabilities program. Also, a person who has 
been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution by a 
department or agency of Federal Government is not prohibited by the adjudication 
or commitment if either: (a) the person's adjudication or commitment was set-aside 
or expunged by the adjudicating/committing agency; (b) the person has been fully 
released or discharged from all mandatory treatment, supervision, or monitoring by 
the agency; (c) the person was found by the agency to no longer suffer from the 
mental health condition that served as the basis of the initial adjudication/
commitment; or (d) the adjudication or commitment, respectively, is based solely 
on a medical finding of disability, without an opportunity for a hearing by a court, 
board, commission, or other lawful authority, and the person has not been 
adjudicated as a mental defective consistent with section 922(g)(4) of title 18, 
United States Code; (e) the person was granted relief from the adjudicating/
committing agency pursuant to a qualified mental health relief from disabilities 
program. Persons who fall within one of the above exceptions should answer 
""no"" to question 11.f. This exception to an adjudication or commitment by a 
Federal department or agency does not apply to any person who was adjudicated 
to be not guilty by reason of insanity, or based on lack of mental responsibility, or 
found incompetent to stand trial, in any criminal case or under the Uniform Code

Countries around the world should be developing fisheries on land in separate environments and farming techniques that can sustain their whole population. Its not a matter of if we will fish all the fish in the ocean, it is a matter of when? 

&gt;A major threat to both this crucial intermediate trophic level and the entire upwelling trophic ecosystem is the problem of commercial fishing. Since upwelling regions are the most productive and species rich areas in the world, they attract a high number of commercial fishers and fisheries. On one hand, this is another benefit of the upwelling process as it serves as a viable source of food and income for so many people and nations besides marine animals. However, just as in any ecosystem, the consequences of over-fishing from a population could be detrimental to that population and the ecosystem as a whole. In upwelling ecosystems, every species present plays a vital role in the functioning of that ecosystem. If one species is significantly depleted, that will have an effect throughout the rest of the trophic levels. For example, if a popular prey species is targeted by fisheries, fishermen may collect hundreds of thousands of individuals of this species just by casting their nets into the upwelling waters. As these fish are depleted, the food source for those who preyed on these fish is depleted. Therefore, the predators of the targeted fish will begin to die off, and there will not be as many of them to feed the predators above them. This system continues throughout the entire food chain, resulting in a possible collapse of the ecosystem. It is possible that the ecosystem may be restored over time, but not all species can recover from events such as these. Even if the species can adapt, there may be a delay in the reconstruction of this upwelling community.

I ended up swapping Feed the Demon (Tier 4) with Fracture and it made quite the difference. Turns out that Fracture acts a lot like Demon Spikes, so you have two charges that independently drop off cooldown, so even with one charge left, it's recharging back to two. That ultimately meant a lot less rotation downtime than expected. I kept the Void Reaver (Tier 7) trait for the time being because even with this change, Soul Cleave is still used.

New rotation is (after jumping in) Fracture, Fracture (generating 4 fragments, putting you at max if you traited in Fallout), Spirit Bomb, then Soul Cleave to use up any unused pain leftover (Soul Cleave doesn't require soul fragments, so you can use it as long as you have enough Pain).

So, I stand corrected on the idea that there's less to press. There may be a slight dead time, but it's nowhere near as bad as I thought. Throw Glaive can even fill that downtime until Fracture is up.

Difficulty continues to go up - I'm at 117 and some enemies are starting to hit hard in dungeons, but the DH seems to be faring pretty well so far, some of that attributed to the new rotation."

The problem was that Blockbuster was afraid to see the writing on the wall (to be honest though, all movie companies still struggle to read it, and probably had very strong limitations on block buster doing streaming). The service was a money loss, and they couldn't pivot by shifting the stores. Basically Blockbuster struggled to completely shift their service into something radically different. The problem is not comparable to Ford, as basically changing the source of energy of a car is not as dramatic, I'd worry more once we see what happens with self-driving cars (something that is a more dramatic shift IMHO) and could lead to Ford changing it's relationship to cars. I could envision Ford becoming a supplier for a self-driving car creator instead of it being the other way around. We still aren't there.

1035	"Devs may not work more in terms of hours than people in many other occupations, but it's often a very different kind of work that's exceptionally draining. A physician may work a lot, but has a much nicer balance. They talk with patients, treat a variety of issues, prescribe medication, meetings, research, visiting patients at home, etc. These different tasks engage different parts of their mind and body.  

In contrast, many devs are just constantly doing nothing but being hunched over at some desk writing code, basically continually forced to do creative work, never really given the time to zone out and work on auto-pilot. 

It's not like that's truly unique either, but it is particularly common within the field, hence the common complaints."	"focusing on this card for what it is, ignoring that it doesn't fit the theme of the face commander of the deck: TLDR, pretty good combat commander, but 6 mana is pretty steep for what it does.

Thantis is actually a deceptive card. Boring at first look, but after having some time to muse on it, I see what they were going for now. The trick is that the abilities *by themselves* are not considered strong, but having all of them on one card makes a synergistic effect that is pretty good. With one card, you are forcing your opponents to attack into an ever growing monster, which will crack back (with most if not all of their team tapped) for commander dmg and then be back on defense.

So the floor on this card (besides constantly being counterspelled) is you're in a field full spellflinger decks with no creatures to speak of, and you play a 5/5 commander with almost no relevant abilities. 

The ceiling, however, its quite high, with utility creatures forced to crash in against you or your opponents, leaving you open to eat said creatures with your commander and other good creatures on your board. If they only attack other opponents, well then you have a repeatable pesudo-[disrupt decorum] effect, which is amazing against other creature heavy decks. 

The problem? It's 6 daggum mana and has no way to protect itself from removal or deathtouch. 6 mana does mean it won't come down till people have begun to build up their boards, when it's ability actually matters, but it also means it has to start swinging the game in your favor pretty fast to be worth the investment and inevitable repayment of commander tax.

Good play and risk management can lead to many successful outings, but must like XCOM a single slip can turn a mission tits up and recovery from such a thing can easily take hours, if not days to recover from (if its even possible).

I highly recommend you play it if you love grim dark aesthetic, challenges of skill *and* knowledge that you will accrue over many long, potentially unsuccessful runs, and a wee bit of sadomasochism to see your pawns in the most dire situations that only your quick thinking and lady luck can pull them out of."

1040	"Man here, with an observation that may comfort you. You don't need to have an orgasm from penis-in-vagina sex to enjoy it. Let me make an analogy. I really enjoy helping a partner come with my hand or my mouth. It doesn't give me any direct orgasmic stimulation, but the sounds and sensations of a partner having an orgasm can be a big, big turn-on. See whether you can enjoy penis-in-vagina sex like that. As long as you have a partner who can help you orgasm in other ways, there is nothing wrong with that. It's fine if you never come from penis-in-vagina sex!

On the other hand, you may learn how. I had one partner who could sometimes come from penis-in-vagina sex, but only if she was on top and moved in a very specific way. I'm not sure, but I think it was because she figured out how to press her clit against my pubic bone, a bit above my penis. To be honest, her movements in this position didn't give me the stimulation that I needed to come. But who cares! I loved feeling her work for it and feeling her shudder and moan at at the end.

In other words, don't worry about it. Penis-in-vagina orgasms aren't required—at all!—for a great sex life. Good luck and have fun."

They have to pass them to keep people from going solar.  The utility  company can only scale down so much.  The company needs a certain amount of people on the grid in order for it to work properly.  Too few and it would cause damage to equipment and power outages.  So lets say if 25% (made up number but there is some cutoff point) of the population went solar, then the plant would have to shut down and then the other 75% of people would be out of power.

"If the website can send code to your browser (which is absolutely commonplace), then that code can evaluate your password as you type it, and in principle could do it without revealing it to any other party.  

In practice, nearly all password authentication implementations communicate the password from the user to the authentication service when the user is enrolled and every time the user authenticates with the password.  (It is possible to design password authentication systems that keep the password secret to just the user, but almost nobody has adopted such systems.  See, e.g., the [Secure Remote Password protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol))

The most-recommended technique for the server to store passwords is for it to throw away the plaintext and store in its records instead a *randomized, costly hash* of it—an operation that scrambles the password in a way that’s:

1. Randomized: the same password when scrambled in the scope of two different password entries will produce different results.  (This is achieved with something called a “salt,” a value that’s supplied as input in addition to the password.  Salts should ideally be chosen at random with negligible chance of collisions.)
2. Repeatable: Every time the same user provides their password to the server, the latter can reproduce the exact same randomized computation.  (This is achieved by using the same salt each time you verify an user’s password as was randomly picked when that password was enrolled.  Which requires the salts to be stored along with hash outputs.)
3. One-way: For randomly generated inputs, output of the function is of little help to an adversary that wishes to guess its input.
4. Costly: It is costly for the attacker to compute many instances of the function in parallel, but not too costly for the server to compute it for the users it authenticates.  This should be true even if the attacker uses specialized hardware that is much more efficient at parallel computation than the defender does.  (This is meant to thwart attacks where the adversary exploits the reality that most real-life passwords are much easier to guess than a uniformly chosen random value of the same length.)

Sadly, it’s very common for organizations to use weak password storage and management practices.  For example, just the other day there was some buzz on Twitter about the fact that Fidelity Investments looks like they may store plaintext passwords.  Programmers also often aren’t aware of the “costly” requirement on password hashing, or of the specialized algorithms that have been designed for this application (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt).  On the use of “salts” for randomizing password hashes there’s also commonly much confusion, with programmers using and recommending practices that aren’t optimal (ideally salt values should be picked at random)."	news	askscience	-1

That with a large enough sample size your “ outliers “ can be a significant number. 

So take any population set adjust for other factors and arbitrarily assign a 1% number defined as a problem. 

Within any large city the 1% will achieve numbers greater than a smaller population size 

I grew up in a small rural community which had one murder in ten years. My community consisting of 3,500 people at the end of the ten years had a representative sample of the area around, but only one known murderer. 

I have attended Dodger games for 35 years. We are not allowed to tailgate. They stop serving beer in the seventh. They have LAPD policing the parking lots and in the Stadium. The LAPD presence is paid for by the Stadium. 

I have seen two fights in person, both involved intoxicated men. 

When Frank McCourt owned dodger stadium I was at the 2009 NLCS game against the Cardinals. After watching the dodgers win extra innings basically the whole stadium emptied at once. Approximately 12,000 cars and 48,000 were left to their own devices. No one directing traffic, no one policing the lots. 

Cheap Ass McCourt decides he didn’t want to pay for basic crowd control. 

I remember thinking it’s a good thing this game went long, plenty of time for people to sober up and it’s a good thing we won, people were in a great mood.  

What does this have to do with the population of a community ?
If we decide that in any given group 1% are shitheads and you draw from a larger population base it pretty much guarantees at any of our sold out games that hold 54,000 people we have at a bare minimum 540 idiots. Baltimore averages 20,000 so based on that they have a total of 200 idiots. 

Throw in some random data that both decreases and increases the chance for an idiot causing trouble. Layer on the lack of crowd control and I believe you will find that 540 potential idiots will potentially cause more problems than 200 potential idiots with basic crowd control in place.

1193	"It is correct, and this article was written by someone who speaks from both sides of their mouth - or has no idea what they are talking about. 

Sure men and woman are different.... 

But that doesn't mean they are different. 

Pro-tip, any differences on a normal distribution has huge relative differences on outliers. In other words, the article concedes everything required to prove Damore's assertions, and proves only that so many people can appear articulate without basic statistics comprehension. 

In other words, looking at the data sets they could look identical in the center, where the bulk of men and women are similar, but if you accept that men aren't women, you concede everything necessary for massive extreme differences in the tails of a normal distribution. So an ignorant person could look at the middle and say they are the same, when someone else is showing that the tails are widely different. 

Edit:
Its also worth noting that if the normal distribution is 'stretched' that is the average is the same, so the middle of the curve is the same, but the standard deviation is larger, this would mean that there would be more mentally disabled men than women, and more genius men than women. Despite both averaging the same IQ/intelligence. There are 4x as many men with severe mental retardation 70 IQ as women. It's plausible there are also 4x as many men at the high end 130IQ to women, despite most men and women being equal, the tails could stretch leading to massive differences at the tails.  

When you combine this with other factors, such as men being more thing oriented, and women being more people oriented, and you have a difference in outliers, its possible that you would only expect 20-30% of the population of high intelligence careers to be women due to distribution (Scientist/Programmer/Engineer/Doctor). Then this might skew for preferences. Intelligent women are more likely to be able to do whatever they want (like intelligent men). So if they don't want to be programmers and would rather be doctors, you could have 30-50% doctors being female. (There are more female doctors graduating now in Canada than male). So those might be eating up intelligent women, taking them from other high intellect careers, so they might be less than 20% of engineers.

* If interest rates fail to rise then existing holders of money may lose with the value their assets falling in real terms (while existing borrowers may gain as they have to repay less in real terms)

If both rise to reflect the impact of inflation, it is much harder to identify who is bearing the cost

1239	I'm almost exactly in the same boat, pal, my shit just began an ended a little earlier in life. That's why that phrase stuck with me. 	"Aside from the extinct species of camel native to North America, in 1862 Europeans started to import camels to British Columbia during the colonization of the region and the explosive time in history that was the gold rush. Bactrian camels helped in hauling heavy materials up the mountainous and rugged terrain of British Columbia. They could comfortably survive freezing winters and boiling summers, and were able to travel long distances without drinking or grazing.

B.C. stopped importing them fairly quickly though because of various issues. First of all, horses, which were much more widely used by Europeans, were terrified of camels and would flee in terror at the sight of them. Camels also had a bad tendency to eat the cargo they were supposed to carry, including clothes and soap (vital to smelly miners). Camel feet were quite soft as well, and they needed special boots to walk the rocky terrain. The final straw was when all of camelkind managed to piss of a very prominent politician in the Crown Colony of British Columbia at the time. Chief Justice Mathew Bailie Begbie had a traumatic experience as his camel went rogue and darted into the wilderness with Sir Begbie hanging on for dear life. He would despise camels until the day he died, and he played a major part in stopping camel imports to British Columbia. (Begbie was just sort of a douchebag in general, and has earned the posthumous title of ""the Hanging Judge."" That is another story, though.)

Domesticated camels in B.C. would be abandoned, killed, or left to chill on pastures. They ceased to be used as labour animals only a few years after being imported. Some camels escaped to the wilds where they would survive as freecamels. These wild camels, dubbed ""Cariboo Camels,"" were spotted until the early 1900s.

[Just for fun, here is the only known picture of a Cariboo Camel.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Cariboo_camel.gif)

He's a nasty little thing"	"well keep in mind, the Rich and powerful don't necessarily need University accreditation to participate in high level leadership and accomplishing their goals..

Examples:

* The Queen of England was tutored most of her life
* Prince Harry holds no Degree but Received Officer Training
* Prince Williams was the first Royal to Enroll at Eton 
* In Fact Prince Charles  in 1970's started it:

&gt;Prince Charles entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1967, where he read history, archaeology and anthropology and graduated with a 2:2 degree in 1970. This was the first time in history that a British monarch or heir to the throne had completed a university degree.

When your life has been planned out for you, and your future secured, you will be trained to take on those roles by those doing the planning. You are groomed for the role from day one. I'm not trying to make this a entitled nepotism argument bemoaning the unfair nature of the rich and famous. It's just the way it is, these kids have a different trajectory than others and to not get trained to capitalize upon that is a waste of their potential. 

And in no way do I mean to diminish the Royal family for not having a traditional modern formal education. In fact people are learning that reliance on university and college education is not a requirement to be successful. If anything the importance of holding such accreditation has been over embellished  in the last 40 years. 

In the article they mentioned that two students raised over a 100,000  for a hospital they had visited as part of humanitarian efforts. It's great, but honestly how successful would your everyday person be to raise such money for a cause. It's like saying I will be a youtube celebrity tomorrow by copying what another YouTuber does. These students have connections with deep pockets, to make that kind of donation feasible. It doesn't diminish what they did, or why they did it, but they are not playing under the same rules as everyone else, and have different resources to capitalize on to make them successful. If you or I tried to Raise money for a similar cause, will we get close to a 1000 dollars in donations? 10000 even? 

All I'm saying is that University is a time sink and goal for people who need it, or want it. 

The Rich and powerful don't necessarily need to invest that time in that are and some for security concerns may never want to expose their family to the public that way. Who wants to have the media lampoon your son or daughter for not ranking valedictorian, or a drop out even. We already make fun of people with art degrees as waste of time for people who are going to be working fastfood. Participation in public systems open you up for the same public judgement.

1260	"Pressure treated 2 by 4 in an 8 foot length is just under 7$ last I bought (month ago).

Pressure treated is a frugal choice on a fence cause the maintenance required to even have a chance of normal wood lasting long will cost much more, not to mention time.  From what I can see you didn't use pressure treated (can't tell for sure from pic)- most of the stuff bought today has a copperish brown cast and up close you'll see little score lines.  

Did you intend to make your fence look like a mess?  Usually people keep their rails evenly spaced (the cross pieces you attach the fence boards to) and section to section will match (depending on grade).  A good fence stain will make everything look better, but first take a couple hours to build it right.  You'll be looking at this fence for decades.  And people who come to your home will try not to laugh at you but word will spread, ""Oh yeah, I went to Tom's, would it be rude to give him a toy toolbox for Christmas? Maybe This Old House dvds?""

Just realized how snarky this comment can come across and that you worked hard on it so sorry (that you worked hard for those results), forgive me, been bedridden sick too long and the azithromyacin has started messing with me.

Looking at your picture again I am sensing that your rebuild didn't actually follow what was there, which can be fine.  Ideally you have a three rail fence, but two can work.  I just did a two rail for a friend and it's fine a month later except for three boards out of 172.  Those three are way warped now.  Anyway, with a two rail fence you're best served havid that top rail much higher, say a foot down if those are six foot boards.  I like using screws for fences.

Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, Dabo Swinney. That's it.

What makes a great coach in my opinion:


1. Do you win games you are supposed to win?
2. Do you generally win ranked games?
3. Do you keep your team in playoff consideration?
4. Do you win rivalry games?
5. Do you have sustained success doing 1-4?

You need to hit those five ticks to be a great coach in my mind.

Saban is the epitome of all of these. He miss stepped on the Auburn game, but aside from that has been lights out in a sustained period of time. Urban Meyer has teetered a little lately with a 31-0 blanking to Clemson two years ago, losing at home when you're favored by 8 points to Oklahoma, and getting blown out by Iowa, but he is still a top level coach in football and is always in the playoff picture.

Dabo is hitting all of these points outside of the random once a year Clemsoning losses, but nobody's perfect. These three coaches are as good as they come.

Still, making huge tax cuts while the economy is already doing well, with no plans to pay for it, is just not good planning. The economic growth we've seen over the last couple of years has been roughly the same as what we saw under Obama, while we've had to borrow more money from China, increasing the deficit, with very little benefit to the poor and middle class. We will have to pay for that eventually, probably after a recession and under a Democrat. Ruining our relationships with allies and trading partners is not going to help.

I think you focus a lot on talking poo because it's the primary place where it's actually visible.  The main benefits of faceid for me, are that it's almost invisible.

My SO looks at my phone, and there's a notification that says I have a new message from Fred.  I look at my phone, and it adds the first line of the message.  She doesn't see that, I do.  It's so smooth it took me a while to figure out it was even doing it.

When my alarm goes off, it goes quiet \(not off, just significantly quieter\) as soon as I'm looking at the screen.  It waits for me to action the alarm to actually dismiss it, but it chills out as soon as it knows I'm aware.  I wake up at 5am, so my SO appreciates this more than I do.

Logging into websites, the faceid logo flashes past before it unlocks the password from my keychain.  Not just on web forms, I've a few apps that use touchid/faceid to resume an existing login \(amazon, our weird oncall app for work, etc\), and it works there.  It's so frictionless that they had to add the double\-click thing to the appstore to stop purchases going through before you could read the price tag.

FaceID is a weird one because the better it works, the less you notice it.  If it's working perfectly it's hardly a feature at all.  This is a great example of the Apple I remember \- the best features are invisible.

Edit: I just checked, if you lock notes, they'll unlock with FaceID too."	My view is that this would be used from the exact opposite scenario.

A lot of the claims like ""women are more likely to take up STEM if encouraged"", and the ""peer pressure of asking questions in class are not mutually exclusive across gender"". There is no concrete statistic that proves women are less encouraged than men.

&gt; Not all slavery was the mass selling of innocent civilians for profit and the sake of industrialization like ours was. I know history can be tough for you to look at because of how much you hate context but if you look back to the time period, civilizations had disputes back then and occasionally out of either the need from a new home from being driven from the old one, or self defense, or even militarism in some nations histories, sometimes they would take each other over and their people as a consequence. Now you had to make a decision what to do with those people, we call them refugees and they called them slaves. They were a lower class sure, just like most shitty people see refugees as a lower class than nationalized aristocrats or upper class citizens. The people they didn’t kill and chose to re-integrate in their society would have been called slaves. They gave them homes and food and jobs and they lived in much better conditions with much better treatment than our version of slaves for instance. I also don’t see how serfdom isn’t slavery, and it’s a fine line between controlling the lower class and prison economy or outsourcing our labor to labor camps and sweat shops oversees than if we had a well treated slave economy. It’s just a term or word, it’s the application in society that mattered. There were plenty of ways you could biblically mistreat your servant or slave and there were also ways you could treat a conquered person with dignity and respect. Owning a slave throughout history did not require roots type behavior. 

Now this was my question: what is the context the makes slavery as condoned and approved by THE BIBLE not immoral? 

I shall try to make sense out of your attempt to answer that question:

&gt; civilizations had disputes back then and occasionally out of either the need from a new home from being driven from the old one, or self defense, or even militarism in some nations histories, sometimes they would take each other over and their people as a consequence. 

We are talking here about SLAVERY in the bible.

&gt; Not all slavery was the mass selling of innocent civilians for profit and the sake of industrialization like ours was. 

Irrelevant. When slavery wasn't mass selling for any purpose, it *is still* slavery.

&gt; Now you had to make a decision what to do with those people, we call them refugees and they called them slaves. 

Are you talking about the bible when referring to ""refugees""????? In the bible we have SLAVES and SLAVERY. NOT ""refugees"".

&gt; They were a lower class sure, just like most shitty people see refugees as a lower class than nationalized aristocrats or upper class citizens.

We are talking here about SLAVERY in the bible, not about lower classes.

&gt; The people they didn’t kill and chose to re-integrate in their society would have been called slaves. 

And that's SLAVERY. And it's condoned and approved by god.

&gt; They gave them homes and food and jobs and they lived in much better conditions with much better treatment than our version of slaves for instance.

How do you know in the first place????? The *only* thing the bible tells you that you may beat them almost to death. We also have direct evidence that females were held as sexual slaves which also defines successive rape. Jewish fathers were allowed to sell their daughters (""of course* *not* their sons, the denigration of women in the bible is *disgusting*) as slave. Now what would happen to such a girl. For the rest this is fantasy.

Anyway, even granting this point for the sake of argument, this fails to answer the simple question: is owning another human ever moral, or not? The relative kindness of a slave owner does not enter into the basic moral question of owning other humans as property. Natascha Maria Kampusch is an Austrian woman who was abducted at the age of 10 on 2 March 1998 and held in a secret cellar by her kidnapper Wolfgang Přiklopil for more than eight years, until she escaped on 23 August 2006. She was treated extremely well but was basically a slave for Přiklopil. Přiklopil, knowing that the police were after him, killed himself by jumping in front of a suburban train near the Wien Nord station in Vienna. When he wouldn't have done that, he probably would have been sentenced for decades in prison.

&gt; I also don’t see how serfdom isn’t slavery

We don't talk about serfdom but about SLAVERY in the bible.

Until now only lame attempts to redefine slavery into ""serfdom"" or the like. Which is plain deceit. The bible talks about SLAVERY. Then we have the unsubstantiated argument that slaves were treated not as bad as in more modern times which does not even provide any context for slavery. And that's about it.

His ult is like a worse version of Axe's Call, his hook is like a worse version of Batrider ult and post 6.80 comeback exp became a thing and made Pudge's snowballing a lot less effective. It also doesn't help that his passive doesn't provide as much as it used to in a relative way. Everybody has more health now, but Pudge's skills have dropped in efficiency.

1437	"We don't need to cut the budget and also yes we have cut the budget in the past. What really needs to be done, is a crack down on fraud waste and abuse of funding. If you are familiar with how bugets work, basically a unit or organization in the military is given a budget decided by someone up the chain from them. If you don't demonstrate a use for all your funding in a FY, you aren't going to get those funds next year. This causes a wave of wasteful spending in September right before the FY ends.

For example, say you give me a budget for this FY of 100 dollars. September comes around and I have only used $75. When you see my amount used vs amount allotted when trying to determine my budget for the next year, you are going to see tgstbi only used $75 and only give me that $75 for the next year.

To prevent this, what I would do is when September comes around is find a way to spend that left over $25. I might buy candy bars that I don't really need but can justify having. So that I use my full budget of $100.

This process is wasteful. Sometimes units spend less some years and more in others. It depends a lot on equipment and unexpected costs. Say I have a fleet of trucks and half of them break down one year. My cost of repairs and parts is going to be huge that year. The next year since everything is fixed nothing breaks so I don't have to spend that money to fix stuff,

Instead of decreasing a units allowance, the unused money should just go back to other government functions, but I should still have the same allowance for the next year just in case."

1440	"I had a very similar experience with my uncle. He is only a few years older than me, and we ended up having very similar interests in a lot of things. I always looked forward to hanging out with him, though he seemed flighty and would never stick around for long which was the first warning sign.

Everything culminated when my parents decided to homestead and my uncle came along with them to help. I moved out with them about four months after they arrived on their new land. I could tell things were tense, but it seemed to just be because of the tensions of living in a cabin off the grid together and issues in dividing the workload.

I invited my wife out with me a couple of months after I had settled in. Around this time, my uncle moved off the property under some pretense of helping my grandpa who lived nearby. Shortly after, my mom wrote me a letter explaining that my uncle (her brother) had been molesting her for the past fifteen years and she finally had the courage to come clean about it. When they first moved onto the property, the three of them (mom dad and uncle) had to share a tent while they built the cabin and the molestation continued every night, which was the source of the tension. I'm really glad he left before my wife arrived.

It was really hard for me to stop seeing him as I always had, which was a close friend and a role model. He is extremely manipulative and charming. I confronted him via text after the letter and he completely twisted the story, so much that I refused to take sides on the matter (which was a really shitty call on my part, and I know that now). I kept in touch with him until I found out a few more things about him from my sister and female cousins. My mom called me one day in tears and told me he was trying to contact her. I gave him a call. Once more, he was extremely friendly and charming and it was very difficult, but I never backed down and told him what the situation was and that he would never be contacting my family again. He never has so far.

I now know him for a sociopath and a sexual predator. It still bothers me, thinking back on the friendship we had, but in the end you need to protect the victims of those kinds of predators no matter what, especially before they assault somebody you care about. I assure you there are better friends out there, ones who don't have that sickness in their hearts."	You can also see Rudy in the show Surviving the Cut.

The anchor is lowered to the bottom, chain is let out, the brake holds while the flukes are set.  Once you are holding, chain is let out.  It is the weight of the chain that holds a ship in position.  The chain link in this incident gets wedged on the lip of the chain pipe.  The brake men released too much brake to get the chain moving.  When it finally broke free there was no friction and once the momentum built there was no stopping the chain. Everyone cleared the area quickly and injuries were prevented. The team shifted to the alternate anchor and we anchored quickly and safely.  The anchors today are the same as they were in WW II and a replacement came from a mothballed WW II ship.

German jail is either keeping you locked up or makes you realize what you did is wrong and then makes you live with the knowledge that you did that wrong thing.

"I'd expand on this to say that different car models will have different depreciation curves. 

Look for what car you want to buy and then look at how it loses value over time. It's usually 2-4 years.

If you're dead set on ""new"", I'd look for a 1 year old car, or something that was purchased and then the buyer had some sort of buyers remorse and needs to get rid of it.

"	"I'm seeing a fair amount of posts over the last month on /r/leagueoflegends outlining how they feel League is being purposely shifted by Riot into a game where only if you act as a team can you win the game.

I'd say that it is true, League is being made into a game that is much more fun and enjoyable if you work as a team compared to attempting to solo carry. Yet I think many people are too quick to blame Riot for dictating that team-play is the path that League should follow.

Due to League being one of the most, if not the most, popular games over the past five to six years content for League is on the rise both in terms of quality and quantity. A large part of League content has always been educational but with the rise of sites such as op.gg, champion.gg, probuilds.net etc. with huge amounts of information that is easily digestible and free for anyone to use has made the game knowledge of the average player much higher than where it used to be when the game could be solo carried. There has also been a huge rise in more expensive/higher quality ways of improving at League such as Vod reviews, op.gg reviews and coaching websites.

So because the average skill is increasing and the number of players is also increasing this means that the skill difference in each division is decreasing. This means that yes one player will probably win the lane over the other but due to them being very close to the same skill level the winning players lead is going to be less than what the winning player could have achieved in the same division 2 years ago. In order to make the lead bigger the winning player has two options A) try to keep the lane phase going and build up such a lead that they can solo carry, or B) work with their four other teammates to gain leads elsewhere and win the game by becoming greater than the sum of their parts (or in this case players). Obviously the safer and more consistent of the two options is to work together with your team to win the game.

Why am I telling you this? You already know that League is being made to be a team game. The point of this long winded post is to show that League becoming a team game is due to how the game  was designed from the start, the most optimal way to play the game, has always been and always will be, as a team. Therefore Riot isn't changing their game to be this way because it's their new direction, they are simply doing what they have always done. 

So if you don't like the fact that League is becoming more and more of a team game, don't blame Riot for making a game that you used to be able to solo carry in into a game where you have to work as a team. You should instead realise that League was never supposed to be a solo carry game and either adapt or find a game that better suites your want to solo carry.

TLDR: Due to LoL being a popular and successful game for many years now educational content has increased, making the average player more skilled, therefore reducing the impact of the solo carry play style, which results in the game being easier when playing as a team and it isn't due to Riot changing their vision for League, it's simply because that is how the game has always been designed to be played.

Even then, it’s rare that such cases are ever successfully reintroduced to the wild, and the average crow lifespan is about 8-10 years. It’s more than just money and knowledge, it’s time. It’s not something just anyone can do.

That said, there’s nothing wrong with having some buddies that visit your house every now and then. Still, they are wild animals, and you have to be careful of accidentally hurting them.

1577	"&gt; By taking a moral stand. It’s illegal collusion.

It’s not illegal collusion to turn away a media circus of a player who has alienated the Cuban-American community like the kind in Miami, the victims of Hurricane Harvey and their families, and people who don’t consider Steve Bisciotti worthy of a comparison to a slave owner from the Confederate south.

It’s only collusion if they can prove some kind of gentleman’s agreement between owners to avoid signing him altogether. That slave owner quip may have soured his reputation a little within the pro football community.

&gt;What’s wrong with a Fidel Castro t-shirt?

I can’t tell if you’re being facetious or if you really don’t see any problem with a t-shirt like that after playing the Miami Dolphins. Miami has a big Cuban-American community with many people that have lived to see friends and loved ones exiled, tortured, and murdered by the Castro regime. It’s a real shame, too, because if he had avoided a stunt like that, he might have had a shot at the backup position at Miami when Ryan Tannehill was out a few games on some injury. 

That was all before he basically made fun of Hurricane Harvey victims on IG and his girlfriend’s slave owner quip, so things might have gone differently if he had a bit more maturity and maybe saved the Castro t-shirt for the after party.

&gt;NFL team owners are exactly the type of people, for the most part, would have spent the Antebellum Period being like DiCaprio in Django Unchained.

That’s fine if you sincerely believe that for whatever messed up reasoning that might be, but they don’t owe you a paycheck if you refer to them with such terminology, and the same goes for Mr. Kaepernick. Even if he had starter numbers, he should have been prepared to have trouble securing any position within the NFL by standing by his girlfriend as she compared them with *literal slave owners*."	That's a fair point. But OP is the one with dagger, wearing plate armor. He's fighting someone who's blasting him with an OP spell. So, the appropriate answer to OPs question is to sneak. He should be avoiding a situation where his enemy would even be arming his spells. A weapon like a dagger would influence your armor.

1591	"What Hearts or events do you recommend to do? Hearts that are interesting or fun or tell a good story?

I know, I know, the common wisdom is that Hearts are not great for leveling, and players should aim to level up doing whatever it is that interests them like PvP or exploration or whatever instead of just straight shotgunning Hearts.

I sort of feel irresponsible just hording every extra penny that I have when we have such a huge issue we are facing.

&gt; Frugal can mean investment now for long term gain.

It depends what you compare it to. Making energy efficiency purchases with extremely long paybacks may be less financially wise than taking that same money and investing it, in addition to exposing yourself for a longer period of time to other events that could extend or destroy that payback.

For example, years ago I spent about $2,500 in my attic doing air sealing, radiant barrier, attic door insulation, duct repair (for air leaks), and a lot of insulation. It reduced my power usage about 20% on a KwHr basis, but dropped my bill even less due to the fee structures.

When I looked at it, just that work had like an 8 year payback, and I think this was before natural gas prices crashed.

At normal market returns, the above project will always lag just having the money invested. At 20 years, a 7% return on the original $2,500 money will be ~$9,000, while the above project will be at around $6500 of value (that includes investing the savings at the same 7% rate once the payback is reached.)

Some of this stuff will depend on a lot of factors, so for you it may make sense. It depends on local energy costs, lifestyle, house condition, and climate. Carbon wise, it probably always makes sense to do.

I looked at getting storm windows on my house (I have a historic home). They were like 550 / window. Even if they reduced my power bill to $0 / month (they won't), I'd be looking at a 7 year payback.

The situation is similar with Solar here. New solar isn't getting net metering last I heard because of some peak power limit that was exceeded by solar. A friend is having this issue and is now looking at adding a battery array.

I'm also not sure of the solar tax credit at this point, but you could be looking at a solar panel array that has a very long payback.

Carbon wise, the above makes sense. Financially, the longer the payback, the longer of a time that you're exposed to other risks on that system where you're not 'building equity'.

1615	"I actually have a general problem with Magical Realism in the US *because* it's ethos is tied to the manifestation of the religious element; the exception being Southern Gothic, which is a regional Magical Realism that focuses on the uniquely pious nature of the South - Latin American Writers *were also greatly influenced by Faulkner and the Southern Gothic for this reason.* Magical Realism without the piousness doesn't make sense.

I haven't read Letham, but I remember a New Republic essay about 4-5 years ago that discussed Letham against DFW, saying Lehtam's style ending up winning because it was a Post Modern Mix of High and Low Culture that created works that were just pensive enough to be considered Art, but certainly more entertaining which lent to their popularity. Again, I haven't read Letham so I can't certainly say, but if what you say is true about the influence of comics on his work I work categorize it completely differently from Magical Realism; say, Pulp Fantasticalism. 

I think when discussing magic in art you have to discuss it in a way that informs the worldview of the artwork. John Constantine/HellBlazer, or Preacher aren't Magical Realism (even though they discuss the religious element); they have more in common with Southern Gothic, and I'd categorize them as London Gothic and Western Gothic, respectively. Kafka, if you accept turning into cockroach is magical, isn't magical realism, it's Absurd and/or Surrealism. I don't think the US (with the exception of the Southern Gothic) can really *do* a Magical Realism based on teh nature of our piousness. The US/West *can* do magical stories though; ""American Gods"" is still on my shelf to be read but it seems closer to the Southern/Western Gothic. 

You hit the nail on the head with Drown. I felt like it was a cheap, Dominican knock-off of Carver. He did no magic in his short stories, which is why it felt fake in the novel. And holy shit, it is a little too close to Bukowski for the New Yorker.

1 - I don’t mind walking, and feel good about possibly leaving a closer space available for a customer with special needs;

2 - I care about my car, and don’t like people throwing their doors or carts/carriages into my car, so some distance from the masses helps mitigate my anxieties about all that;

3 - If the person has parked apart, s/he must also care about her/his car, so is less likely to be careless with respect to my vehicle;

4 - I did not realize it would bother you if I was parked next to you, since I see you as a kindred spirit;

5 - And, finally, this is important - it is easier to properly line-up my car in the parking spot with your car next to me as a guide.

1639	The whole situation is fucked. KNVB lets teams from the 2nd division vote on whether or not the league continues during international play. Due to the low level of the league, most teams don't have any internationals, so they voted in favour of continuing to play during international break. This obviously hurts the teams that do have internationals, such as Twente, Sparta and NEC this season. The youth teams used to only play against each other (I presume it's the same this season) so they'd get even matchups but for regular clubs there is no such 'compensation' (for a lack of a better word). In essence, teams with either a good youth system or with a good scouting apparatus get fucked over massively because of the KNVB wanting to be democratic.

Ever drive through a tunnel listening to the radio?  Sometimes it dies out, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it stays longer than others.  That has to do with the attenuation of the signal down the tunnel (which is acting as a waveguide).  If the channel is higher frequency, that means the carrier wavelength is shorter so the waveguide (in general) will carry the signal further (there will be an ideal waveguide design for any particular frequency that will carry it the furthest but that's another detail).

What does this have to do with microwaves?  Well the holes are actually tunnels that are reaaaaaaaaly short.  Tiny demons driving their flying cars through the holes would hear microwave radio stations die out part way through the drive because the waveguide is too small for the signal to propagate far.

Now, Trump (as the usurper) are trying to took down the pillars of power one by one and took over, while the Kings (the shadow govt) are trying to pull his army off and took him down.

2) Stock roms have honestly gotten better. The device I flashed most heavily was my old OG HTC Desire. Because the stock OS *was* trash. Fortunately it was basically a Nexus One clone so we had lots of options :)

Lots of people like to tweak the hell out of a rom,,, but much of it was borne out of just fixing things that should have worked but didn't, porting updates that didn't come to your device, or making noteable performance improvements. Stock roms are much more optimised so there's much fewer performance gains to be had, and generally things being broken just doesn't fly like it used to, so there's lots less to fix. Porting updates is much harder due to point 1 above.

People still make roms for the nature of having options, but there isn't the necessity for it either. Your phone works how it should out of the box - it doesn't *need* a custom rom."	"*Market rejects the pay for the position*

Other studies have concluded that even in the worst of the recession, only about 6% of analysts ratings were ""sell"".  In short, it is easy to disparage analysts recommendations based on their prior inability to predict larger market trends.  Here they have split almost on a even distribution between buy/hold/sell which brings attention to their lack of consensus.  Either the metrics they are analyzing are credible or they are not.  If they are just vengeful, overly defensive suits who allow their feelings to get hurt, then they aren't being sufficiently dispassionate to allow the numbers to make the decisions for them, and it is fair to discount their opinion.

1715	"In Puerto Rico the system of emergency shelters and the evacuation of at\-risk residents works very well.  That's not why hurricane María was so deadly.  [This CPIPR story from Dec. 7](http://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2017/12/nearly-1000-more-people-died-in-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria/) sheds a lot of light:

&gt;The majority of these deaths were men and women over 50 years old who died in hospitals and nursing homes from conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, kidney disease, hypertension, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. When compared to the same time period from 2016, there was a significant increase in deaths, especially in hospitals and nursing homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although September saw increases in deaths for all groups over 50 years old, in October, increases occurred in all groups over 18 years old.  
&gt;  
&gt;In September, the highest peak of increase in deaths was seen among people between 70 and 79 years old. In October, that peak pertained to people over 90 years old.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, the October data also showed significant increases in deaths for people between 30 to 39 years old (36&amp;#37;), and also between 40 to 49 years old (23.3&amp;#37;).  
&gt;  
&gt;\[...\] The revelation of this new data also coincides with accounts from relatives’ reports of victims that point to problems with essential health services such as dialysis, ventilators, oxygen, and other critical circumstances caused by the lack of power in homes and hospitals throughout Puerto Rico.

On Dec. 9 the New York Times published [its analysis of the same data](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/08/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-death-toll.html) which adds to the above:

&gt;The deadliest day was Sept. 25, the day the governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo A. Rosselló, [warned that a looming humanitarian crisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/puerto-rico-maria-fema-disaster-.html) could prompt a mass exodus from the island.  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump responded that night by [taking to Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912481556127780865) to say the island had to deal with its massive debt: “Food, water and medical are top priorities \- and doing well. #FEMA.”  
&gt;  
&gt;It was [over 90 degrees](https://www.accuweather.com/en/pr/san-juan/00901/september-weather/275478?monyr=9/1/2017), and power was out on most of the island, even in most hospitals. Bedridden people were having trouble getting medical treatment, and dialysis clinics were operating with generators and limiting treatment hours. People on respirators lacked electricity to power the machines.  
&gt;  
&gt;On that day, 135 people died in Puerto Rico. By comparison, 75 people died on that day in 2016 and 60 died in 2015.

Note again the above paragraphs are about Sep. 25, but the hurricane struck on Sep. 20.  At this point evacuations were no longer a relevant factor.  The article just keeps going on like that:

&gt;On Sept. 29, Héctor M. Pesquera, Puerto Rico’s public safety secretary, said in an interview that the death count would not swell by much.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Will it go up? I am pretty sure it will go up,” he said. “It won’t double or triple. It’s not like an earthquake where you have a building and you don’t know whether there were 20 in the building or 300 in the building until you get all the rubble out.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The day he said that, 127 people died, 57 more than the year before.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Oct. 3, nearly two weeks after the storm, Mr. Trump visited the island and praised the low official death toll. He [referred to the 1,833 deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/us/puerto-rico-trump-hurricane.html?_r=0) in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina as a “real catastrophe.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Sixteen people certified,” Mr. Trump said. “Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together.”  
&gt;  
&gt;By that visit, an additional 556 people had died in Puerto Rico compared with the same period over the two prior years.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Times estimates that in the three weeks after the storm, the toll was 739 deaths. If all those additional deaths were to be counted as related to the hurricane, it would make Maria the [sixth deadliest](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/dcmi.shtml)[ hurricane](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/dcmi.shtml) since 1851.

The NYT story also details the clinical causes recorded for the deaths:

&gt;Records from Puerto Rico’s government show that some of the leading causes of death in September were diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, although the causes of death are still pending for 313 of the September deaths. The number of diabetes deaths was 24 percent higher than it was last year — and 39 percent higher than it was in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the highest surge was in deaths from sepsis — a complication of severe infection — which jumped 50 percent over last year. That change is notable and could be explained by delayed medical treatment or poor conditions in homes and hospitals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pneumonia and emphysema deaths also saw spikes.

Note that both these news stories I've quoted are from December.  **All of this information was available months ago.**  The death toll is Puerto Rico received a lot of attention recently since last week with the release of a Harvard study, but that study actually didn't contribute much new information, it mostly just confirmed information that the public already had."

"To answer your question, that would be because making videos and similar entertainment on the internet is an entrepreneurial job, for starters. He is not an employee of YouTube, he's an employee of himself. YouTube isn't his employer, it's his platform. A job on YouTube consists of a couple things; talent, and business savvy.

If you're not able to make money on YouTube after investing time and energy into learning how to and then producing and marketing content, and investing capital in the tools to make it and somebody else is, why do *you* think that is? I'd guess it's because they're ultimately doing something better than you are. Either your content isn't good enough, or they're just much better at marketing theirs.

If two people do the exact same work, but one makes millions while the other makes nothing, they're probably not doing the exact same work, they're just trying to.

I actually studied the connection between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and HSV while an intern at an AD research foundation a few years ago. While I have no sources with me at the moment, we found that there was a statistically significant correlation between the beta-amyloid plaques characteristic of AD and an HSV infection in the central nervous system. Herpes viruses lie dormant in the neurons of the brain, but can activate and reactivate throughout the course of its host's life. It is a common opinion that the beta-amyloid plaques form from an aberrant protein folding, which causes them to self-aggregate similar to prion diseases. The exact relationship between AB-plaques and AD was not entirely certain during the time I was an intern, although I'm sure advancements in that correlation have appeared between then and now. I chose to pursue a less-common opinion: that the aggregation of amyloid-beta was an antimicrobial response to pathogens in the CNS. AB seemed to have a similar appearance to a few types of antimicrobial proteins found in other parts of the body, and HSV was commonly found entangled in AB plaques. One counterpoint that I considered but did not have time to explore further (mine was a summer internship) was that amyloid beta plaques were simply sticky, and picked up cellular debris at random. It has been years since I have studied this field, and my memory has lapsed a bit since then. If I were not on vacation away from my work computer, I would include links to the studies I researched to come to the tenuous conclusion that more research was needed into AB's possible antimicrobial function. I am overjoyed to see that this possibility is being explored. 	funny	science	-1

It seems to me that you don’t know what you asked her to sign up for when you joined and that’s fine, it’s really impossible to understand when you are young, but it’s not necessarily her failing, and it seems like you have zero idea of what life is like on her side. I notice that a lot with the younger married guys on base.

I just want to caution you that this does not reflect well on you as a person and I think you might come to regret it when you are older. You will never again meet a woman that you can “grow up with” like you have the opportunity to do with your first wife. You will be giving that up without even trying to save it and you just have no idea how valuable it is. I almost gave it up too and I’m thankful I got my ass into counseling.

She is young and will move on and get married to someone who will cherish her and you might do the same, there are definitely positives that can come from this, but the alternative, staying with the woman you promised to love forever and being a man of your word and finding out how to grow back together despite pretty difficult circumstances (that YOU chose to expose her to) is what will actually make you a better person than you are right now, and that’s what life is all about."	skyrim	relationships	-1

"As a metaphor, consider plugging electrical items into a socket - so to switch from one item to a second will involve turning off the first item, unplugging it, plugging in the second item, then switching the second item on. Simple enough, but there is a notable period in the middle where you are switching items and there is nothing active.
Instead consider having two plugs available - with your items plugged into a socket each, all you need to do is turn one off and turn the second on without having to unplug anything as you are doing it.
If you want to use a third item, you can then switch it over with your unused one in preparation for the next swap.

This is similar to a dual clutch gearbox - by having two clutches with one gear attached to each, shifting between them can be done far quicker as the gearbox does not have to move around the mechanical elements of the gearing at the same time, only activate and deactivate the clutches.

This is something that only really matters when you are considering high performance sports cars - driving a normal car around town, a typical driver can easily shift a (far slower to use) manual transmission more than fast enough to drive comfortably. When you look to areas like racing however, the difference between a great change of tenths of a second and hundredths of a second will add up and can make a big difference when races can be won and lost by those margins."	books	explainlikeimfive	-1

"You stop arguing and let them be, until you realize that thigs are not so black and white. There are many different interpretations of the OT writings and laws, so your parents are not really being ignorant when they say that. Certain things can only be understood within a lot of historical context. For instance, the Torah/OT included a rule that said that disobedient sons could be put to death after being found guilty by a council of elders. Barbaric, right? Well, actually, this rule represented a great moral progress for the time: with one stroke, it preserved parental authority and at the same time put an end to arbitrary honor killings (which were very common at the time, and actually still happens today in some parts of the world), since it required an independent council to judge each issue. And there is no evidence anyone has ever been condemned by such a council.

People want to barter and haggle and some deem that personal contact necessary."	"since there's so many systems that operate so differently, best I could do is give you a specific example.

Let's say my goal is to produce human protein X in an immortalized animal cell Y. 

1. Step 1 is getting a construct that can express human protein X. I would take human cells, extract the RNA, run a reverse-transcription reaction to turn mRNA into cDNA, PCR amplify the cDNA coding for protein X, and ligate the PCR product into an expression vector. 

2. Step 2 is preparing the delivery system. I may use a process called transfection to insert the expression vector into a cell line along with a viral packaging system. The host cell will produce the viral proteins and package the expression vector. The virions are then released from the cell. I would take the culture supernatant and filter it to remove any host cells or debris.

3. Step 3 is transducing the animal cell Y. Basically just mix the virus with the animal cell. The viruses don't have a copy of the full viral genome, only the expression vector and integration stuff. This is called a single round infection. The virus goes into the cell, produces integration machinery, and integrates a portion of the expression vector into the host genome. the vector may also carry a resistance gene, which allows me to poison and kill off cells that don't have an integration event. 

4. Step 4 is verifying the expression of protein X. This is typically done by Western blot. 

and that's it, I now have an animal cell that produces a human protein, forever. That's one form of genetic modification. "	explainlikeimfive	askscience	-1

The fact that we don't live in a perfect meritocracy doesn't mean we can throw ability out the window.  You're doubling down on this insane argument, and I'm not going there.  It's absurd.  Some engineers are simply more valuable than other engineers to their teams, companies, etc.  It's irrefutable.

&gt; Now in once point your saying biologically women are inferior at performing the job of being software developers

I never said that.  I'm suggesting that on average, males and females are different, including our brains.  That's scientific truth.

There isn't enough evidence to say that those differences should result in a higher percentage of engineers being male.  But there is enough to demonstrate we can't claim females should represent 50% of the engineering work force.

But if there were scientific evidence that say, females should make up 18% of the engineering force, that shouldn't change the feminist argument.  Females should be judged on their ability and value to the company, not their sex.  Arguments that are based on imaginary notions of idealism that could potentially be debunked by science are weak arguments.

&gt; I also don't see the negative impact of diversity

Again, neither do I.  I see a problem with mandated diversity.  I've seen more qualified people passed up.  I've seen positions created out of thin air to hire a female in order to fill a real position with a male who happened to be the most qualified for that position in order to meet diversity metrics (which is ultimately a disservice to the female going into the made up position).

(Bear in mind, most teachers and I do lots of these things for all students because it helps the kids and makes it easier on us.)

Examples of goals students must measure: 

""With minimal prompts by teacher, student will be able to identify the main idea in a text and follow its development through the text. Student will respond correctly and in complete sentences 4 out of 5 times with 75% accuracy."" 

(This is not an actual goal of any student of mine, but it is very typical of one of three or more goals measured per student.)

This is all to be done in a 30-student classroom and other kids who have challenges and some who perhaps need special ed themselves.

You do your best and keep in mind how each kid must feel. Some of them report feeling dumb or thought to be dumb, unaccepted, unable to make friends, bullied stared at, criticized and laughed at by peers when they want to be ""normal."" 

These kids can learn, but perhaps they cannot express and/or understand it in the singular, same, old way we have taught for way too long. It's a mess.

I have a hard time with the ""gosh, we didn't know"" stance the school presents. If you have a burnt-out or unqualified teacher like the one in the recording, they have likely exhibited this same attitude in faculty/staff meetings, casual conversations, in front of mentor teachers, or even the principal! Word gets around. It's hard to believe no one there knew about or talked about this.

Special ed students his age are considered unable to advocate for themselves (They're too young!). The parent does. Just my opinion of course, but the tape should stand. The school was not forthright with the inability of their staff to meet the qualification levels of the school's advertising and promises, and the mother advocated because she suspected wrongdoing at the expense of her minor child.

I am astounded anyone could look at that adorable kid's smiling face and have so little feeling for him. I try not to judge, but there I go. Guess I still have some work to do, too. "	todayilearned	news	-1

1792	"This isn't a paper, it's a comment on a post, and on a response to an ELI5. There's places for formal correctness and strictness.

I agree that my statement could have been made more specific by adding a ""more ways"". It's true that this solves a very specific type of matrix transformation problems that, itself, is only applicable at the moment on a very specific type of use. This isn't the most revolutionary or great paper out there, but it has value. If the ability to convert from one to the other were so obvious, someone would have done it back in 2016, and they wouldn't have started the paper with the assumption that ""you can prove there's no way to do this on a classical computer"".

So yes, we do have a new way of doing a transformation. Does it help with Shor's algorithm? I don't know but I doubt it. But that's like someone inventing a better hammer and someone saying this hammer will help us hammer in things better, and then someone responding: ""Well I don't see it working well for an imperial screw"".

I mean, why even publish this if saying that it has value to build more on is just ""wishful thinking""? Mathematical proofs have concrete value when they are non-trivial, otherwise they'd leave it as an exercise to the reader. 

But you like facts, not giving them since you have no evidence or case that I'm misguided in my beliefs, and simply handwave them away, but certainly ask to receive them, and I shall give.

Let me quote the paper:

&gt; Thus, we argue for the following guideline: when QML algorithms are compared to classical ML algorithms in the context of finding speedups, any state preparation assumptions in the QML model should be matched with ℓ^2-norm sampling assumptions in the classical ML model.

That's mostly focused on how you can prove some types of quantum algorithms have solutions that are just as quickly on a clasical computer. Here's a bit on how you can do the mapping:

&gt; How a classical algorithm can perform as well as the quantum algorithm. The classical algorithm we present cannot be compared to classical low-rank matrix completion and approximation results requiring linear time. Rather, the key insight is that the data structure used to satisfy state preparation assumptions can also satisfy ℓ^2-norm sampling assumptions (see Section 4).

&gt; So, a classical algorithm whose goal is to “match” the quantum algorithm can exploit these assumptions, which are known in the classical ML community to be quite strong (as seen in Frieze, Kannan, and Vempala’s paper [10]). From there, performing an implicit projection of a vector onto a subspace to get a sample recommendation is not outside the realm of feasibility. Our algorithm just puts the two pieces together.

As the last line says, the paper mostly works by grabbing two facts and putting them together to prove a path from assumptions of a quantum algorithm -&gt; assumptions in a classical algorithm, which allows translating between the two.

Will this matter for other linear problems? I can't be sure. This is a common issue in ML. This offers a new tool: you can now convert certain assumptions in a matrix into a quantum scenario (and maybe find a solution that cannot be translated to a classical problem due to separate reasons) or you can find a quantum algorithm that takes advantage of similar properties and translate it to a classical one.

It's a very specific tool, but it's still a new tool. Notice that there's many other tools that are done to translate the quantum algorithm into a classical one, previously known tools. You can look at the references part in the paper to see more about these.

The thing is that we have to be realistic that this is a minor addition. You can spend years adding a few grains of sand to the castle of human knowledge. Over decades this will actually get to a new tower. Still this is how human knowledge increases, by slowly adding a grain, not knowing who will build what on it, but knowing it's a new platform for something even higher."

I think you focus a lot on talking poo because it's the primary place where it's actually visible.  The main benefits of faceid for me, are that it's almost invisible.

My SO looks at my phone, and there's a notification that says I have a new message from Fred.  I look at my phone, and it adds the first line of the message.  She doesn't see that, I do.  It's so smooth it took me a while to figure out it was even doing it.

When my alarm goes off, it goes quiet \(not off, just significantly quieter\) as soon as I'm looking at the screen.  It waits for me to action the alarm to actually dismiss it, but it chills out as soon as it knows I'm aware.  I wake up at 5am, so my SO appreciates this more than I do.

Logging into websites, the faceid logo flashes past before it unlocks the password from my keychain.  Not just on web forms, I've a few apps that use touchid/faceid to resume an existing login \(amazon, our weird oncall app for work, etc\), and it works there.  It's so frictionless that they had to add the double\-click thing to the appstore to stop purchases going through before you could read the price tag.

FaceID is a weird one because the better it works, the less you notice it.  If it's working perfectly it's hardly a feature at all.  This is a great example of the Apple I remember \- the best features are invisible.
