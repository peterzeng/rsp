First off, a lot of employees get incentive compensation that is directly relative to there performance which is a lot easy to look at a metric to see rather than a CEO. Who is not dealing with day to day of a business. Also cognitive task in general have shown a negative relation between higher compensation and performance [study](http://www.novarete.com/blog/motivate-employees-monetary-incentives-produce-poor-performance) it mentions two studies. The study in the article I listed in my first response even showed that was not actually true if you look at the research where they looked at a 10 year focus. Yes but multiyear performance metrics are set by the CEO even so the compensation is negotiated by the CEO and the board wants to keep the CEO happy and make it seem that they are doing well so they will take a median pay for a lot of CEO's then pay above that because they don't want to give the interpretation there CEO is performing bad for public image or whatever the reason may be. Metric's are not always company focused but purely shareholder which is not long term focused. Here is a [link](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/how-companies-decide-ceo-pay/530127/) to a piece by the Atlantic it does an excellent job explaining how compensation actually works for these large organizations.

8	I know you're just making a joke, but if you were curious about interest rates on bonds: Bond rates vary with a lot of factors, one of the largest being the 'quality' of the issuer, which is basically a rating agency evaluating the creditworthiness of the issuer, in this case Comcast.  Bonds with grades over a certain threshold are considered 'investment worthy', which means there is a relatively low risk of default.  Investment-worthy corporate bonds will probably run you around 4-5% in this market.  Lower rated bonds, called 'junk bonds' have a higher interest rate, as they have a higher risk of default, and can run up to like 8% interest.  Not having researched Comcast before this comment, I would guess them to be an investment-grade company, so if you want in on this action, they may be issuing at around 4.5% 	"IF this is per month, a lot of these things are off:

The Mortar elite kit has the longest range of anything available to engineers and is great for picking stuff off at way beyond its own range while people are distracting it.

13	"Catholic theology on original sin is generally a lot more nuanced and less fire and brimstone Calvinisty than other denominations though, so it seems weird to go after this in a Catholic context.  Mainstream church teaching on original sin is that people aren’t culpable for Adam and Eve’s actions, since, obviously, they’ve personally done nothing wrong, but rather that the consequences of original sin are still present in human nature, which church teaching describes as ‘wounded’ and stIll dealing with the aftereffects.   

I think it’s also important to keep in mind this is usually paired, in Catholic teaching at least, with the idea that even while dealing with original sin, humans are ‘made in god’s image,’ and therefor have a natural tendency towards good.  So even at your worst, a person still has the ability to be good and kind, and to move forward, and even at your best, you shouldn’t think of yourself as higher or better than others, because you’re still always capable of doing wrong and acting cruelly.

&gt;Trends in CEO compensation last year:
Average CEO compensation was $15.2 million in 2013, using a comprehensive measure of CEO pay that covers CEOs of the top 350 U.S. firms and includes the value of stock options exercised in a given year, up 2.8 percent since 2012 and 21.7 percent since 2010.

&gt;Longer-term trends in CEO compensation:
From 1978 to 2013, CEO compensation, inflation-adjusted, increased 937 percent, a rise more than double stock market growth and substantially greater than the painfully slow 10.2 percent growth in a typical worker’s compensation over the same period.
The CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 20-to-1 in 1965 and 29.9-to-1 in 1978, grew to 122.6-to-1 in 1995, peaked at 383.4-to-1 in 2000, and was 295.9-to-1 in 2013, far higher than it was in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s.
If Facebook, which we exclude from our data due to its outlier high compensation numbers, were included in the sample, average CEO pay was $24.8 million in 2013, and the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio was 510.7-to-1.

45	"&gt;I think your anger is misplaced on a short sighted problem. 

The federal allocation of the discretionary portion of the budget is not ""short-sighted.""  Nor is *states'* and other local governments' short-sighted response, to sell essential infrastructure to the highest bidder, contractually cutting all prospects of future infrastructure improvement within your and your childrens' lifetimes.  

&gt;The issue is more so on where tax money should go. If it went into infrastructure instead of bombs in the first place we would not be having this discussion about secondary clauses. 

True.  And if I could reallocate federal budgetary funds, I would.  But it's easier to get local governments to *not* sell highway lanes and bridges to the highest bidder.  Ultimately, yes, this is due to a combination of factors.  

&gt;The current state of infrastructure is that you can't just rely on public money. 

...Because of how discretionary spending is broken down.  Which is a large part of the *real issue.*  

&gt;New projects are too expensive and because much of the current public infrastructure is maintained from tolls exacted by the state, there are shortfalls just to pay for basic maintenance. 

Again, because of budgeting.  And also because many local governments have realized that they don't *have* to pay for new projects.  It's much cheaper to *sell them,* because then they don't have to cut any existing programs or pass unpopular taxes or bonds to pay for improvements.  

&gt;Historically a lot of infrastructure gets built because of private interests. That's how capitalism works. 

Yes and no.  The best example of this would be, what?  Probably the trans-continental railroad.  Which has faithfully generated income for and served private interests for nearly 150 years, now.  The moment you start talking about things like highways, that average consumers use on a daily basis, the situation changes.  I, and many other people, simply avoid toll roads.  There's a box you can check in google maps to do that.  And the *public* road system is good enough that you can do that.  It is not unsustainable.  Current federal, state, and local budgets are simply not allotting the funds necessary to improve them.  

&gt;Most of the fiber networks and railroads were built by private corporations. 

Are you serious?  ISPs are facing numerous lawsuits for refusing to expand networks as they contractually promised to do in order to obtain operating licenses in many states ([1](http://www.govtech.com/network/Comcast-Sues-Vermont-over-States-Request-to-Roll-Out-Broadband-to-Rural-Areas.html)) ([2](https://qz.com/213995/comcast-promised-poor-americans-cheap-internet-but-most-of-them-didnt-get-it/)).  Better yet -- companies like Comcast lobbied for and received large Federal and State subsidies to expand their service networks in rural areas, and [never followed through](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/the-book-of-broken-promis_b_5839394.html).  To the tune of $400 billion.  

That money never went into the promised infrastructure.  I'd be oversimplifying if I said it went anywhere in particular, but it went straight to those companies, and stayed there.  Profits.  

&gt;There's an infrastructure boom in Europe and Australia right now because of these public-private partnerships. 

Yes and no.  A large part of that is [increasing competition in the market](https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/is-our-great-mobile-ripoff-about-to-end/3378051/) -- a market that, if you read the previous link, was previously monopolized to the extent that wireless providers were pulling in 40% net profits.  

[That's an insanely high figure](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/093015/whats-good-profit-margin-new-business.asp) for a large business. They're raking in money hand-over-fist.  And they're not using it to improve networks or infrastructure.  That's going to dividends and stockholders.  It's a business.  

That said, I'm comparing cell and internet networks to bridges.  You don't need *competition* to have a *successful bridge.*  You just need *a bridge.*  

&gt;I would rather there be infrastructure built than not built and you can't protect your billions of dollars investment without some sort of protective clause in place. 

A *bridge* shouldn't be an investment that needs to be protected *from other bridges.*  

&gt;It would be fiduciary negligence on the part of the investment firm. The fact that private firms managing public money own the roads is not a problem for me. 

They charge money for services and infrastructure we already pay for.  It's like FedEx versus the post office.  Except...I can choose to use either one.  It would be like FedEx prohibiting USPS from offering overnight shipping because they wanted to protect their own business.  

The fact that local legislators would sign on to ideas like this is *insane.*  It's not in the best interests of consumers.  The best thing would be for a municipality to set aside _% of their budget until they could *pay* for the [bridge].  Or levy a small tax.  After all, what's a toll?  *I take that back.*  A toll levied by a local transit authority can help to cover the costs of maintaining infrastructure.  A toll levied by a private company does that, but profit is skimmed from it.  Inherently, less money winds up being reinvested in the infrastructure.  Right?  

&gt;Oftentimes the best maintained roads are privately owned and operated. 

True, and that's most often due to the [decreased traffic they carry](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/12/570248568/are-40-toll-roads-the-future).  

&gt;I suggest that you complain about budget allocations to your state to favor public infrastructure. 

You're kidding, right?  Many of these infrastructure projects can't be altered for *a century.*  There's nothing they, or I, can do.  

&gt;I know that it's easy to point figures and be angry about traffic but attacking the creation of infrastructure is a short sighted goal since the creation of these toll roads will alleviate some traffic by definition (the private firm identified an area of congestion and built a toll road to allow people who want to pay to escape traffic to do so) and any free lanes created as a byproduct is only of public benefit.

No.  Just, no.  Selling these projects to private companies means that profits will be skimmed from bridges that would otherwise have paid for themselves, or had to have been subsidized.  The crippling contractual agreements that prohibit additional infrastructure improvements for *centuries* are just the icing on the cake.  

If you think traffic is bad now, just wait *50 years.*  These contracts even prohibit the construction of additional mass transit, like trains and subways.  *There is no way out.*  

It's simple profiteering.  Local municipalities have sold out for campaign contributions.  Their constituents just haven't realized *how badly* they've been screwed over, and they won't for years to come.  Urban sprawl will continue.  Traffic will get worse.  And there's nothing anyone can do about it, now.  "	If you're cold, you should put a sweater on.

51	"When I was in school, I was fine with dress codes and I was never mad when they were strictly enforced. This is coming from someone who then and now loves to dress up and who takes pride in how she looks. My opinion was then and still continues to be irrespective of men's clothing and what they are allowed to wear. Reason being, me saying I should be allowed to wear something exactly as someone whose body type is not exactly like mine is not always logical nor is it sensible. I am a woman: I dress based on having a woman's body and also based on my petite weight and my short height. I certainly would not dress myself as if I were tall and fat. I dress as my body is made. 

I have breasts that had to be contained securely in a bra and an appropriate blouse. I have a butt and hips that I preferred look demure while I was learning about AP Biology and Shakespeare. I had no time to be pulling and tugging at a piece of clothing while I was reciting sonnets or setting up a microscope. My midriff was reserved to be seen while I was walking in a two piece bikini at the beach, not while I was rushing down the hall to get to class before the bell rang.

Speaking from my own experience in high school, I took pride in how I looked and in how I presented myself in public while learning. I took my school's dress code as a base guideline that was implemented to ensure that all appearances in my school were sensible and rational. I didn't take it as a punishment. When in school, I followed the school's rules. When not in school, I did all else that I wanted.

It is the same in adulthood when an employer has dress or uniform codes in order to have the employee be a representative of the company. The employee is free to dress to their heart's content when not at work. When at work however, the employee is representing the company so they have to abide by the company's dress code. I see this same logic for schools. When in school, you follow school rules. Some people see school dress codes are restrictions, I see them as an opportunity for peace of mind and a lesson for adulthood.

Pick your battles carefully. If at age 14 to 18 you're already making a fuss about school dress codes and you have an issue following rules of authority, imagine what life will be like for you as an adult. Your paycheck, your reputation, and the prospect of your career advancement will all be determined based on how you follow all rules and abide by all those rules. Your school principal may coddle you but a future employer likely won't.

53	"&gt; I would venture that something as simple as the server sends a salt and the client side send back the password hashed with that salt, would prevent an eavesdropper from ever seeing the password and also prevent them from running rainbow table attacks on the hashed password. The eavesdropper can then not see or use the original password.

TLS (HTTPS) will solve the ease dropper problem.  If you do what you just suggested, the server never knows the original password to login, meaning the client always needs to send a salted password, therefore the salted password IS the password and the ease dropper still has it.

Ultimately, if the attacker is listening in on your connection they can mimic the client completely.

TLS works because during the handshake when the connection between client and server is being established, the client will generate the key to use for communication back and forth in memory. 

The new encryption key will then be encrypted itself using the known server public key asymmetrically, so that the only way to decode that message and get the real key, is by knowing the private key on the server, which hopefully only the server has.

If an attacker was listening in on this handshake, then all they would see is the real key encrypted using the server's public key.  The ease dropper can't decrypt it because he doesn't have the server's private key.

From there, both the client and server use the new encryption key the client decided on and communicate back and forth using the same key to decode/encode messages.  The actual key itself is never transmitted over the wire.

This is why most people trust TLS.  It's great for stopping people not part of the communication listening in, but not so great at stopping a participant in that communication from reading/manipulating the messages, which is a whole different problem.

Cheating in video games is a good example where TLS doesn't really help.  If you don't want a hacker looking at or manipulating the network traffic themselves, you usually need to do some custom encryption and even then just hope the attacker is too lazy to figure out what you did.  If you do your own custom encryption, you need to ensure you have a secure key exchange similar to TLS otherwise, once the 'trick' is out, people can ease drop on your custom protocol since they know what data to capture during the handshake.

61	"Rey's run as World Heavyweight Champion was a big part of what killed my interest as a die hard fan when it happened.

Rey winning the World Title should have been such an easy feel good story. But they managed to screw it up literally every step of the way.

He wins the Royal Rumble and that was fine, though he spent way too much time talking to Eddie's ghost. But then he loses the shot next month to Randy Orton and instead of winning his way back into the match, Teddy Long just puts him back into the match.

Then Wrestlemania comes and even though Rey had won the Royal Rumble they don't give him the main event of the show. Which to my memory, is the first time that had happened since Stone Cold won the Royal Rumble in 1997 (there was Vince winning in 1999, but everyone knew he was going to headline Mania). 

It's a slap in the face. Usually the winner of the Rumble goes on last at Wrestlemania. Instead Rey goes on third to last with a playboy pillow fight co-main eventing. He's in a triple threat match with Randy Orton and Kurt Angle and if they were given the right amount of time they could have had a 5 star match. Instead they get 9 minutes that they have to run through and the crowd never gets into it, in fact they actually boo Rey. Meanwhile, Triple H and John Cena go on last and have a plodding, mediocre 23 minute match that nobody really talks about.

Then Rey jobs out and gets destroyed throughout the entirety of his run. He gets matched up with guys who have the worst possible styles for him (Khali, Mark Henry, JBL) even though this was a period when Edge, Rob Van Damn, Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels, Matt Hardy, Booker T (who he did wind up jobbing too) are all active on the roster. He gets a win over JBL for the title at Judgement Day as a gift.

They don't even let him get a win over fucking Sabu on One Night Stand. Then he drops the title to Booker T, after Chavo hits him with a single chair shot, and goes onto lose to Chavo.

70	Teachers are faced with two very different competing demands on their time. They're expected to be knowledgeable and passionate about their respective areas of focus and expertise, but also serve the role of essentially babysitters looking after oftentimes troubled children. It's a tough job. I don't know if they're not necessarily being paid enough. But if you want to bring more people into the fold as far as the professions are concerned, you need to try to understand what has been preventing people already. Usually it's a combination of not willing to either take measures to reduce costs (I.e. offering online courses that should be able to be offered for pennies on the dollar compared to current colleges) and defunding/not adequately funding programs. This is of course a symptom of a more general trend of not investing in people and probusiness social policy meant to enrich the few at the expense of the many.	Baffling some people don't understand this is doable. The top 1% of income earners in this country take home roughly twenty-two percent of all income. Yeah.

I think the problem in both cases was that they felt better so came off their meds without telling anyone. Still, it's so stressful and upsetting for the children to have such an erratic parent.	"A financial asset's present value is usually the discounted value of future cashflows/growth. E.g. An office block's value is the future net rental cashflow's 'discounted' back at the investors required rate of return. Investors may asign different values to the same asset as they are using different required rate of returns or use different assumptions; mortgage costs, repair costs, vacancy etc.

The same can be used for stocks by estimated the future value of growth or dividends.

Bonds are the easiest as they are very simply valued based on their known cashflows (coupons) and redemption value (principle).

"&gt;The DNC platform advocates for abortion up to and including 24 week mark, that's my issue.

I'm not sure where you're getting that, since if you look at the [actual DNC Platform](http://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.democrats.org/Downloads/2016_DNC_Platform.pdf) you'll find no such language. Here is the entire language of the Democrat's platform as it relates to abortion and childbirth:
&gt;Democrats are committed to protecting and advancing reproductive health, rights, and justice. We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should have access to quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion—regardless of where she lives, how much money she makes, or how she is insured. We believe that reproductive health is core to women’s, men’s, and young people’s health and wellbeing. We will continue to stand up to Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide critical health services to millions of people. We will continue to oppose—and seek to overturn—federal and state laws and policies that impede a woman’s access to abortion, including by repealing the Hyde Amendment. We condemn and will combat any acts of violence, harassment, and intimidation of reproductive health providers, patients, and staff. We will defend the ACA, which extends affordable preventive health care to women, including no-cost contraception, and prohibits discrimination in health care based on gender. We will address the discrimination and barriers that inhibit meaningful access to reproductive health care services, including those based on gender, sexuality, race, income, disability, and other factors. We recognize that quality, affordable comprehensive health care, evidence-based sex education and a full range of family planning services help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions.  

Nowhere in there is ""we want to ensure elective abortion up to 24 weeks."" A number of pro-choice advocates, but certainly not all, have advocated against *banning* abortions at greater than 24 weeks, because such bans often do not take into account the health of the mother, or contain exceptions for incest and rape or where the baby would be born severely deformed and unlikely to survive. Since certain tests cannot even be performed until almost 20 weeks, any abortion restriction set at 20 weeks or earlier would essentially force women to carry to term children that were certain to be born dead or near-dead.

I think you're thinking of the issue of ""viability"" as it relates to *Roe v. Wade*? In that case, the Supreme Court determined that the State did not have a compelling interest in preventing an abortion until the fetus became ""viable,"" which the Court defined on the basis of medical science at the time as in the third trimester, or after 24 weeks. At the time *Roe v. Wade* was decided in 1973, that was completely accurate medical science; babies born at 24 weeks or earlier had virtually no chance of survival. Now, in 2018, babies born at 24 weeks have a roughly 50-70% of survival, though quite often if they do survive they suffer severe birth defects that will affect them throughout their lives.

Democrats now often oppose Republican's attempts to ""chip away"" at *Roe v. Wade* through laws which would limit abortions only to 20 weeks. The problem is that there's basically no good medical science declaring exactly where the line of ""viability"" is, or what that means under *Roe v. Wade.* Regardless of that, most scientists agree that 20 weeks is too low; there is virtually no survivability except in extremely rare cases for fetuses born at 20 weeks."	Music	worldnews	1

That's how sales AI works as well, by feeding the algorithm, it analyses historical figures to predict the algorithm going forward, so that figures you may not have considered allow you to predict the market e.g. it may scan news articles and sales to see that the sales of fried chicken go up, when price of marijuana drops.

The way that sort of analytics works is each type of tracking/detection is creating a confidence score of the odds that the tracked behaviors are the person in question (or alternately, a ranked list of possibilities of who it may be). 

Those scores are combined across techniques to cross some threshold and have the system say ""yup, this is who I think it is"". (Biometrics work the same way, like finger print readers -- the system calculates a score representing the odds that the read fingerprint is the person in question, and above some configurable level, it says ""yup"")

So the issue is, changing your style of language may drop one factor from, say, .8 to .5 (just as an example). But there may be other markers that were already high. So that may not matter for recognition, plus the system may do back-training to essentially say, well we're 90% sure this is still this person, so adjust the learning in the one that came out low to boost the confidence. Or, create a new profile and link it to the person.

"At this moment, since there are only 25 participates and the city must be cherry picking their hires to make it look like the program works - I'd say the homeless probably don't use drugs at all, not even pot.

If this program were to be opened up to the masses, yes, many of them would spend the money on drugs and it wouldn't be just legal pot.

I think the program is a waste of taxpayer money.  The streets would get much cleaner if you hired actual workers to clean the roads for the same amount of money as undoubtedly the homeless will work at a snails pace compared to regular workers.

Will this program help homeless get off the streets?  Absolutely not if they continue to do it the way they are.  The homeless are restricted to 4 hour work days, 5 days a week max according to another poster here.  That is not enough in San Jose to get off the streets.  All it is fun money for homeless which I personally do not want to give them with my tax dollars.

For this program to even have a chance at working,, employees need to be drug tested routinely.    The work needs to be just one part of the program.  They need to  mental health counseling/medication, support groups, etc. They should be put in touch with housing support for the homeless.  And 4 hours of work isn't enough.  It would be a good stepping stone to get them used to working again but the City would need to find other jobs for them that are full time after an initial period.  And they really have to screen their applicants well.

205	But why is it there, in that location, in Latin? In Watchmen, the phrase is spray painted openly on walls and signs by protestors in English. In BvS, it’s in a news article about Batman’s exploits as a hardened vigilante (which KIND OF works, though the shot literally skims through the article to focus on only the pictures, and you have to pause it to see it), but also in the place where Batman and Superman fight (seriously, is it an abandoned library or a hospital or something?). I’m not saying that the topics the film brings up aren’t potentially interesting, but the film pushes its self-importance in the most annoying and pretenious way possible. Nolan has struggled with this, too. For some reason, every single character the man has ever written feels like they can quote Ulysses. Generally speaking, the placement and use of phrases alluding to overarching themes are difficult to include naturally for many writers. Outside of his circle of fans, Snyder’s recent online activity addressing his attempts at symbolism are being met with a lot of ridicule as well as discussion on how symbolism should be pulled off in order to function most effectively. By comparison, someone like Charlie Kaufman is praised for developing the symbols and phrases in his films by creating their own meaning within the context of the plot and characters. In the case of BvS, aside from people who actually study Latin, who is supposed to catch what the hell the writing on that wall means? Do people need to study the whole broader context in order to fully understand it? Simply put, I just think the placement of the quote in the shot is pretty stupid. I can’t logically why it would logically be there where no almost no one can see it and be written in a dead language.

210	"In that case, we may see the 8/8+ dropped this year in lieu of the new LCD iPhone's release. The SE might also bite the bullet, cleaning up the iPhone line to 2 models - 1 entry-level, 1 high-end (kind of like the regular/pro variants with the Macs and iPads). 

Given that they have made the non-Pro iPad more powerful this year, it seems like they are using it to target the education market, which puts the 10.5"" iPad Pro in a weird spot. It still has a better display and a faster SoC (I think), but its size advantage is starting to be nullified by the non-Pro iPad's newfound Pencil support. Getting rid of the 10.5"" iPad Pro leaves the 12.9"" iPad Pro as the ""Pro"" device - the laptop replacement, which makes sense given its size. The regular iPad, which I think is 9.7"", remains the standard iPad that everyone knows and loves, and at its price, it remains a compelling option for people who want a tablet but don't need the faster refresh rate or other bells and whistles of the Pro line.

That would leave us with:

* 2 laptops (MacBook, MacBook Pro)

* 3 desktops (iMac, iMac Pro, Mac Pro)

* 2 iPhones (LCD 2018, X2)

* 2 iPads (regular, 12.9"" Pro)

Almost symmetrical, and it would be if they just completely scrapped the Mac Pro, but I think there's still quite a few people out there that like the idea of the Mac Pro and want to see an updated version. Alternatively, the iMac Pro in its current form could just be a stopgap measure, and the form factor (AIO pro device) could be retired when the new Mac Pro is announced. The new Mac Pro would then take the name of ""iMac Pro"" while retaining the non-AIO form factor that is more useful to content creators and professionals that want to upgrade their machines over time. Apple would, theoretically, release new displays to go along with the re-designed iMac/Mac Pro, but that's a different story."

1) The category of “Fungible” Labor can change rapidly, such that even highly skilled jobs that were in demand recently can rapidly lose bargaining power. Doctors, engineers, etc. are in demand now (and probably will be for the foreseeable future) but that’s hardly a guarantee and individuals even within those fields will likely see erosion of their ability to negotiate for higher wages with the rise of automation. 

2) What exactly is the point of focusing on efficiency gains if the benefits concentrate largely within an ever-smaller class? Do we build our economy to maximize return to investors or to provide the highest quality of life for as many as possible? Of course, these overlap to some extent, but I think it’s clear that some trade off of ROI/efficiency is necessary to increase overall well being.

Teaching occurs in all walks of life. It happens in Universities, corporations, federal organizations, etc. Corporations can also be run on obedience and adherence to the rules rather than promoting free thinking and employee creativity. A lot of school superintendents are not trained on how to run an organization or how to solve problems. They create a culture of hierarchy vs community.

Every organizations has hierarchy. The most successful corporations don't promote hierarchy though. They emphasize teamwork and community. ""We all work together to make better product."" Schools emphasize heirarchy. They ~~don't~~ see the kids as the product. Which means you have to whip your product into shape so you look better. The best schools see the grades/performance as the product. What are the kids gpa? How are the sports team doing? How are the schools groups like FIRST robotics, Honor society, Orchestra, etc. doing?

There would be too many people trying to get into the field, and the jobs would have to be rationed to applicants based on the school board's own prejudices. 

We need highly motivated teachers and paying them 20-40k per year is not helping our kids.

You argue that when a job pays too much, you're going to get corruption in the hiring agency. I would agree if there were only a small number of such jobs, but there are teaching positions all over the country. Regulations can also be instituted to protect against illegal hiring practices.

If you set a bunch of objects afloat on the surface of a sphere, it's inevitable that they will occasionally form a big clump before breaking up and moving on again. Before Pangea, other 'clumps' were Vaalbara, Ur, Kenorland, Arctica, Atlantica, Nuna, Rodinia, Pannotia, Gondwana and Laurasia, and probably some others we don't know about.

If you take a look at a globe (or Google Earth) today you will notice that most of the landmass is still on one side with the Pacific covering most of the other side.

The US was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic ties with Pakistan. We used Pakistan against the USSR, and later on as a sort of a ""forward base"" for many things in the area, Afgan shenanigans included. 

That pushed India further towards the USSR than we would have liked. But they stayed neutral all things considered.

IMO one of the reasons we loved Pakistan so much was not only because of their location, but their more authoritarian government and the fact that they're a smaller country right next to India. India can become a major force, Pakistan will never challenge the US. We like propping up small countries as allies to counter major regional powers. 

But really, in hindsight, if we knew India would have stayed neutral and how much we could have benefited economically bilaterally, and the fact that a modern and strong India would have been a very effective counter to China right now. 

We thought China would ease up and become more democratic, just like Japan, SK and Taiwan, but nope. We thought India would become a hostile force that's tough to influence/control and well, they didn't, no thanks to our policies."	news	worldnews	1

Unfortunately you saw this before getting married and like a lot of people I assume you thought it'd change after you got married or that your ""love"" would be stronger.  Learn from that for what's inevitably going to be a time when you're wanting to be with someone.  This has been going on for 9 YEARS!!  It's not going to get better barring some significant change and work on her part.  You will continue to be miserable, you will continue to grow in resentment and frustration.  Unless you see her changing, you need to get out.  It's so hard to see it when you're IN it, but things become very clear when you are out of it.  I know you've invested a lot of time, and people get accustomed to what they have and begin to think it's ""normal"".  It's not.  Some might even call it abuse (mental and emotional).  Her behavior is NOT the behavior of someone that loves you.  Your marriage is already over, you just don't know it.  You can stick in there and be miserable for more years to come.  Some of, what SHOULD be, the best years of your life.  You can stick in there and fall more and more into thinking it's normal and years from now you won't recognize who you've become.  OR, you can get out now.  It's going to be hard because you've made excuses for it for years, and you've grown accustomed to it.  (You hear all the time about spouses staying in spite of the abuse).

I'm on my second marriage and I think I'm actually experiencing it with her now, but NEVER with my previous wife or girlfriends.  It was just such a common thing for me, how could it possibly have ever felt special?  People may argue and they may be right for them, but think of it like this...if you kissed 100 people many times, how hard is it to kiss the 101st?  That's what it was like for me.  Doesn't mean sex isn't still fantastic, it is, but I wish it had more of that deep emotional bond that people talk about.  Probably the other difference would be that for a while, it made my need for ""not basic sex"" higher.  Not as much now that I've settled down with the love of my life, but earlier there were times, basic sex just wasn't enough to even excite me.  "	relationship_advice	AskMen	1

One issue here is that you're suggesting that because there is a discrepancy, it needs to be fixed.

Take something patently obvious, like the front line of a NFL team.  Sex based preferences, on average, may lead to less women desiring to play football.  Physical attributes, on average, may lead to less women capable of performing successfully on the front line of a NFL team.  So mandating 50% of the front line of every team be female could lead to driving men out of positions they are both more qualified and interested in performing.

So I think it is valid to question and understand the source of the discrepancy before we just assume it is something that needs to be corrected.

"DoR is probably my favorite take on the series. As a long-time fan, many of the small quality of life improvements were really appreciated - especially the naval and air force changes which made them far more accessible in the early/ mid-game economy, and more functional on the battlefield. There were still a few lingering balance issues surrounding things like anti-tank which felt shoe-horned in, but it generally worked.

The story mode was a nice touch and worked well for the game with its character ensemble ""anime-esc"" plot. It made for some really creative missions. Unfortunately, the characters weren't quite as charming and memorable due to the way the game was fundamentally structured. Only the core starter characters stand out.

That said, I doubt we'll ever see another game like, nor should we, precisely because the comedic tone of the franchise was a key part of its identity and ditching it for a dark post-apocalyptic war story simply hurt the game's appeal.

""others are promoting family planning, which affects (long term) component 1. ""

We have very good ideas about what affects population growth.  If you want you decrease population growth, you decrease child mortality, increase education, especially for women, improve living conditions, ensure a safety net for older people, keep a stable government, and make family planning available, along with education on how to use it.  When you help with those things, the population undergoes demographic transition, and people have far fewer children.  it's happened over and over again.  It's very nice that all those things that affect population growth are good in general, so morally it makes sense anyway.

Nobody is suggesting killing people.  Killing people is an indication of an unstable environment, and that causes people to have more rather than fewer children.  "	"Depends on what the company did and why they bought it.  

Often in the industry that I'm in, the 'company' itself is not worth much, but the service contracts are.

Of course, the people from the bought company go and join other companies or start new ones, which win the contracts the next time they come up.  Rinse and repeat.

Your partner needed a human connection and you gave him a checklist.  He did fuck up in some major ways, but a part of this is on you.  From his perspective, he's probably been miserable and lonely (while cultivating an addiction that is in many ways as bad for you as alcoholism), and then when you finally came back after 6 months you pestered him about the dogs, which he was probably already stressed about.  

You guys need to go your separate ways, but you should strongly *strongly* encourage him to get help for his gaming addiction.

443	"TL;DR

Enemy is in a concentrated formation, more concentrate formation wins.  
Formation also allows the men in the back to replace anyone in front during a charge.  
Formation is made to allow Cavalry to charge, pull back, and charge again; if they can't re-charge, they become no more than infantry on a horse.

\----------------------

The solid formation gives it weight and integrity for when it slams into the enemy formation. It allows the formation to crush right through the enemy's formation, usually Infantry. Especially since the formation is impacting the enemy's, the people in the centre of the formation can replace anyone in the front rank who falls. 

Kind of the same with a phalanx, the man behind you naturally forces you forward and can replace you if you fall. For Infantry Square, it used to be a solid block of infantry. As it progressed towards the Napoleonic wars, the squares became slightly hollow so that the formation could maximise the use of its' firepower. (also for the officers and NCOs to run about commanding IIRC). But, note that even then the squares were 4-6 men deep depending on country; leading to a formation that is still substantial.

So both formations are already thick and solid, if the attacking side is flimsy and spread out too much; they would take too many losses to make the attack worth it. So a strong charge on a single point or a spread out attack? The Focusing of firepower/strength on a single point is also very well known by other names (German ""Schwerpunkt"" and so on). An analogy would be pressing a needle point first or side first into an apple, which is easier for the needle to go into the apple?

Probably one of the more famous Cavalry types are the Winged Hussars, who employed a charge that started out from a loose formation. As they started the charge and got faster, the formation tightened until the point before the attack. As they impacted the formation and followed through it, they would circle back to prepare for another charge. During combat, the charge would have been executed multiple times."

When I was younger, I too wanted to as well.

The government is trying to increase prosperity of all citizens (at least, citizens it deems ""important"", ie predominantly Han people in the east, as opposed to ethnic minorities in the west/south), but only in that it recognizes that failure to provide for those it rules is a threat to stability, and stability is valued over all things. 

I get that it's more communitarian as opposed to individualistic. But at the same time, I think the ""left vs right"" divide has a lot more to it than just individualism vs communitarianism (at root, anyway). 

Besides, you could argue that there are places like South America that are extremely leftist, yet the socialism-fostering aspects of culture there are strongly tied to or supported by the Church, at least locally (see; liberation theology) and how"	videos	worldnews	1

If people really felt that masculinity is truly toxic, then they would say that masculinity were at fault rather than toxic masculinity, a term that would seem redundant to them.

If someone actually hated the issues that appear in some black communities, they would call it blackness rather than toxic blackness, which is what happened in the past.

465	"&gt; Dunning-Kruger

Yes.  The [Dunning Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

Are you asking what it is or why they're debating its relevance here?

In a nutshell, the Dunning-Kruger effect involves two main components.  Simplified and crassly put:

* Dumb people think they're smart.
* Smart people think they're dumb.

More accurately, those with the least amount of relevant knowledge or experience on a particular topic tend to over-estimate or exaggerate their ability.  Where conversely, those with the most experience or knowledge tend to under-estimate their ability.

An easy to remember example is to ponder a poll that asks everyone to rate their driving ability relative to everyone else on a scale from 0 to 10.  If we were all honest and accurate, the result would be 5.

In this case, the ability to recognize the limits of your knowledge puts you at risk of being in that group that underestimates their ability.  But, to be honest, I have no idea what prompted snarkerz' earliest remark."	"The purpose of the 25th is for something like when a sitting President undergoes surgery or is in a temporary coma or something like that.  It may even apply to when he's been attacked or injured in an accident.  The idea is that *something* has occurred that has *incapacitated* the President.  Before the 25th amendment, this scenario would have been a constitutional crisis in the sense that succession or what to do was ill-defined.  The 25th provides a mechanism to figure out what to do.  But that's why it's both immediate and temporary.  The need is to get someone acting as President immediately.  But the entire context of the problem being solved is a temporary thing.  The President doesn't cease being President, per se.  It's just that the VP slides into ""acting"" President immediately.

This was never meant to be what to do if the President has slid into dementia or whatever.

To be frank, you could consider that scenario to remain as ill-defined.

But be that as it may, with impeachment and the 25th we do have two courses of action available: impeachment and the 25th.  Both are clearly defined.  There's no doubt what to do.  There's no reason for either to be entertained by any lower court to say nothing of the SCOTUS.

In any case, if your goal is permanent removal of Trump (no matter the motive) then using the 25th is silly.  It will *never* result in permanent removal.  Kinda silly to stage a coup if every four weeks you have to ask permission to continue with the coup.  Furthermore, if you already have the support in Congress for impeachment and removal then just do that.  The support required just to keep the president out for another four weeks via the 25th is **greater** than that required for impeachment and removal.

What was troublesome about your earlier post was due to the stated motive being out of sync with how the 25th works.  If your goal is some strange corrupt removal of a President to push forward an alternative government then the 25th doesn't work for that goal.  The President becomes ""temporarily relived of duties"" and the VP becomes ""acting President"".  That's the *only* change and it's temporary.

As far as I can tell, there's another problem with the 25th that might arise.  Say the cabinet does this and then while Pence is ""acting"", Pence dies or is killed.  What in the world happens then?  What should happen then is the President appoints a new VP which is ratified by both houses of Congress.  But if the President were truly incapacitated... then what?

Next, you seemed to be suggesting Mueller's investigation would be closed after this cabal takes over.  Invoking the 25th wouldn't change anything unless you believe that Pence would immediately do what Trump hasn't yet - fire Sessions and Rosenstein, etc.

If that's what you believe, I'll retract the ""nonsense"" claim.  I remain unpersuaded.  But that idea is indeed possible and may merit consideration.

Lastly, as much as it pains me to say this, your determination of Trump's ""unfitness"" is essentially just your opinion - one I share, by the way.  But if the US electorate **chose** this, appealing to the 25th isn't our best bet.  If the voters wanted someone who acts like this, then a democracy is going to give them what they want.  Our real battle is to convince the Congress that we (the entire electorate) really don't continue to want this.  Then, and likely only when that's clear, will they finally move for impeachment."	science	politics	1

So he wanted to tell his mom that his dad was cheating every night but that would disrespect his dad, but not telling her disrespected his mom which really fucked him up as a kid.

Then when he hit puberty his dad made him take some experimental medicine to kill his acne because he believed Michael's charm was in being this pure little innocent boy, but the medicine ended up chemically castrating him which effectively meant his dad robbed him of his childhood and then robbed him of his manhood too.

So he became this little boy in a man's body trying to hold onto his childhood that he never had, to the point that he built an amusement park and tried his best to get other kids to have great childhoods in his place.

I truly think he was one of the most innocent people to ever live."	videos	AdviceAnimals	1

513	"&gt;but I would prefer that they crtitiicized both sides.

But that's the problem. Each individual issue doesn't have ""both sides"". Sometimes we don't know the truth and experts can disagree, but that disagreement isn't binary. Politics in America involves a two party system due to our winner take all system, but that is not how reality works. And sometimes we do know the answer and 'both sides' is diluting the truth, not strengthening it.

The President attacked the free press this morning. That's a truth that shouldn't be 'both sides'ed. Bringing up how in 2017 a reporter from CNN factually reported that he and the Prime Minister dumped fish flakes as if this is some sort of 'counter-point' to a direct attack on a free media, is emblematic of the problem. 

""Both sides""ing is how we got to this place. Honesty even when it draws outrage is how we get out.

&gt;Overall, I just prefer news to be in the middle, rather than spew left or right propoganda.

There is literally no such thing as a 'middle' in terms of political opinion. Everyone's 'middle' is a purely subjective construct from where they stand. While there are some basic factual disagreements (climate change, health care costs, conspiracy theories) almost all of it is a matter of values. And demanding the news place their values in the middle of people who want gay people accepted, or suppressed, want unions busted, or supported, who don't care about corruption, and who do, is how you get the media to the weakened point it's in now.

Trump should never have been elected. Regardless of the racial and economic factors he was playing to, if we'd had an honest media discussion of exactly what the man is like, he wouldn't have been elected. He has always been a joke and a criminal, an admitted sexual predator and an imbecile for every matter of substantive policy. But the media did what you asked. They simply reported facts about what candidates did, and whenever Trump was criticized, they felt they had to 'both sides' it, even if that meant bringing on people who'd just lie to defend him, or criticizing Hillary when it had no merit. 

Honest journalism means you don't align your speech to what the other person considers moderate to them, or pretend both sides of every argument should be given equal weight. 

The President attacked the free press. Can't we actually talk about that and it's consequences, instead of making the exact same mistake that got us here, by hand-wringing that honest journalists who are trying should maybe be less critical for the sake of appearances?"

That is an unhealthy reaction though. People who explode because of such minor things are usually suffering from depression, I think.

He did not mean it, it was the depression talking. The way I see it there are things you can get furious about, but a toilet seat or a plate is not one of them and you should also not draw the connection that this is done because the other person does not care about you.

541	/u/kenkenkenken  gave a good explanation about how a small change in average can change how often water is frozen or liquid, but there's another aspect that is worth noting: Changing an average can drastically change how often one gets an extreme. For example, if you have a variable is approximately a [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) then a tiny increase in the average will result in many more events where the result is very large. The same applies for changing the average a little smaller. In fact, changing the average of a distribution also is an easier way to get more extreme events than increasing sample size. The upshot is that if you increase the temperature even a tiny bit, this is going to drastically increase how often the very hottest days occur. (In general, temperatures are not normally distributed, but as a close first approximation this works pretty decently). 	"Dark matter and dark energy are different concepts. In both cases they aren't placeholders ""for all the things you don't know yet"" but are rather specific items where the evidence strongly suggests that those things exist but we can't infer what they are precisely yet.

That with a large enough sample size your “ outliers “ can be a significant number. 

So take any population set adjust for other factors and arbitrarily assign a 1% number defined as a problem. 

Within any large city the 1% will achieve numbers greater than a smaller population size 

I grew up in a small rural community which had one murder in ten years. My community consisting of 3,500 people at the end of the ten years had a representative sample of the area around, but only one known murderer. 

I have attended Dodger games for 35 years. We are not allowed to tailgate. They stop serving beer in the seventh. They have LAPD policing the parking lots and in the Stadium. The LAPD presence is paid for by the Stadium. 

I have seen two fights in person, both involved intoxicated men. 

When Frank McCourt owned dodger stadium I was at the 2009 NLCS game against the Cardinals. After watching the dodgers win extra innings basically the whole stadium emptied at once. Approximately 12,000 cars and 48,000 were left to their own devices. No one directing traffic, no one policing the lots. 

Cheap Ass McCourt decides he didn’t want to pay for basic crowd control. 

I remember thinking it’s a good thing this game went long, plenty of time for people to sober up and it’s a good thing we won, people were in a great mood.  

What does this have to do with the population of a community ?
If we decide that in any given group 1% are shitheads and you draw from a larger population base it pretty much guarantees at any of our sold out games that hold 54,000 people we have at a bare minimum 540 idiots. Baltimore averages 20,000 so based on that they have a total of 200 idiots. 

Throw in some random data that both decreases and increases the chance for an idiot causing trouble. Layer on the lack of crowd control and I believe you will find that 540 potential idiots will potentially cause more problems than 200 potential idiots with basic crowd control in place.

Just because I said I'm more inclined to doesn't mean I avoid movies that had sex in them those are two different things. If I did I would have said I only watch pg because I can't handle it. However I'm simply saying I'd rather more plot that could mean less plot holes isn't a bad thing. That's why it made me more inclined those movies didn't have plot holes or if did not as big. I go for them because of that reason. I want a straight story not wasting time on unimportant.

Okay you don't understand what I'm saying. They can show everything getting started then save that time for more important scenes. You may think it's needed but it isn't. Some of the best movies I've seen are that way. They show the start and you know they connected physically. But that's how you see things because around us people have been conditioned with selling sex. If every movie cut it out you would see what the true good movies there are. If they can't keep your attention and tell the story without then is it really about the story. Watch The Magicians they do a great job with it. The rape scene could have been shorter because it wasn't about the rape but how it affects that person and every choice she makes after. Then the recap kept showing it over and over no reason for it. The other sex scene was done very tastefully and well. They kept short and to point. Was maybe 30 seconds they were covered to, I honestly didn't care about that, it showed how emotions control/are where magic comes from.

Lower rated bonds, called 'junk bonds' have a higher interest rate, as they have a higher risk of default, and can run up to like 8% interest.  Not having researched Comcast before this comment, I would guess them to be an investment-grade company, so if you want in on this action, they may be issuing at around 4.5% 	"I am very pleased that you have dug up the archives here.

I am a night owl, my body only starts to feel like it is ready to work after 16:00 and full speed at 20:00-ish. Because of that, my body simply do not, I mean it really doesn't, function in the morning. No matter how much I try to change myself and my sleep patterns. 

I can even go to bed early and I'll still be feeling awful in the morning and accomplish close to nothing. It has been this way since my early teen days, I'd drag myself out of bed to go to school and feel sleepy and low energy the whole morning and hardly productive. 

I try to push myself to do things in the morning since it would be easier while dealing with other people but only a very few times I am successful on making those events happen.  

It is really frigging hard to make my body work in the morning, it is like I have to use all my fiber, all my energy, being that physical and mental, and give myself a pep talk that I got to get up and do it no matter what. The process is incredibly draining and exhaustive, which also render me to be a ""zombie"" for the rest of the morning until it is the time for my body to really ""wake up"".

Talk it out with your boyfriend and try to filter down the possibilities for him to feeling the way he does. I came with peace that, no matter what society dictates, my body will never function the way people expects and trying to do it so makes me unhappy, irritated, cranky, moody and miserable.

We're talking about a full generational change here, changing everything from ounces, pounds, fluid ounces, cups, gallons, inches, feet, yards, miles, to use a completely different measurement system. I don't think you really understand the difficulty of that, even if somehow everyone agreed. 

Every single American car currently in existence has its odometer set to miles. Every speed limit sign, is in mph. Every interstate has mile markers. Every single food item has a weight or volume in customary (the only things that don't are pretty much just soda, wine, and spirits). American football deals with yardage. Are we going to convert that to a field 100 meters in length instead of 100 yards? That's going to change the game, and we'll have to repaint every field in the country. All the cookbooks, measuring cups, etc. in most houses in America all measure volume in customary. Manufacturers have their equipment set to create goods to specific dimensions... in customary. If we change all the half-gallons of milk to metric, are we going to start selling ""1.893 liter"" bottles of milk? People will still call them half-gallons, then. Will we instead make them 2-liters of milk?

Even if I did, I wouldn't trust some strange college kid to get real LSD, mushrooms, or DMT. Where I live, the only drugs that seem to be around are heroin, Fentanyl, opioid pills, or coke (I hate coke and all stimulants.)

*(I didn't want to retype my entire response as a few other people have mentioned Darknet Markets so I'm going to be lazy and copy and paste. I apologize for my laziness.)*

Yeah, I know about Darknet Markets and have been on them before years ago but have never ordered anything. Unfortunately, DNMs today are basically nonexistent. I mean, I know there might be one or two sites left but the only ones left were set up by law enforcement to catch everyone. I think they called it a *'honeypot trap'* or a *'honey trap'* or something like that. (It's been a little while since I've checked out what's going on in the DNM world.) Law enforcement had created one of the new DNMs, and shut down all the others, so people all moved to the ""new"" one that law enforcement controlled and started arresting everyone once they watched enough transactions go through. I forget what the site was called. I kept seeing one post after another from people who got ""love letters"" or had law enforcement try to do controlled deliveries to them. I'm in recovery from heroin addiction and bought heroin and other drugs between once and 4-5 times a day, 90% of the time going into the worst part of a major city (where white people are immediately stopped and searched for suspicion of drug sales and being in a ""high crime area""), on and off for 15+ years, and was only ever arrested 3 times and not a single time was I arrested while buying/picking up drugs. I only ever got arrested for stupid traffic violations which then caused me to get pulled over and then searched but never got caught buying drugs. I saw people posting on DNM forums how they made just a couple small purchases off DNM and already got busted (either by getting a ""love letter"" or getting a controlled delivery). That seems like horrible odds. DNM aren't anywhere near as safe to buy from as they were years ago when Silk Road was around. I've already had run-ins with the law and would prefer to never be arrested again."	"1. You don't need to hire an attorney for your first speeding ticket.

The links do use different references. The first link calculates GDP (PPP) by using the 2000 dollar as a reference. The second link calculates GDP in terms of 2018 dollars. Based on the numbers, if the 2000 dollar was used for the second link, the African American household median income would almost certainly be lower than what's shown for Germany in the first link. 

&gt; That's pre-tax income. Welfare can only come from tax revenues, so if German income is lower, then German income + welfare benefits are still going to be lower than American income + welfare benefits.

This is correct. However, per-capita figures can be misleading because they mask inequality. The US has a higher per-capita income than Germany, but Germany spreads out the income more efficiently through welfare-systems and transfers. The study I posted goes over the empirical benefits that the average German sees from these policies. 

Ultimately, despite the US' high per-capita GDP, German citizens still have comparable standards of living.

&gt; Adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines in aging rodents and primates. Aging humans are thought to exhibit waning neurogenesis and exercise-induced angiogenesis, with a resulting volumetric decrease in the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region, although concurrent changes in these parameters are not well studied. Here we assessed whole autopsy hippocampi from healthy human individuals ranging from 14 to 79 years of age. We found similar numbers of intermediate neural progenitors and thousands of immature neurons in the DG, comparable numbers of glia and mature granule neurons, and equivalent DG volume across ages. Nevertheless, older individuals have less angiogenesis and neuroplasticity and a smaller quiescent progenitor pool in anterior-mid DG, with no changes in posterior DG. Thus, healthy older subjects without cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric disease, or treatment display preserved neurogenesis. It is possible that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis sustains human-specific cognitive function throughout life and that declines may be linked to compromised cognitive-emotional resilience.

685	"For the following points feel free to replace 'Messenger' with any IM app of your choice (Whatsapp, Telegram, Viber, Line, Skype, WeChat, iMessage, etc.)

1. Messenger is free, just requires wifi/data connection. A lot of carriers in the US offer free SMS (or at least some free SMS), but that is not the case everywhere. Besides, generally if you're on an unlimited SMS package, you are paying more for that feature.

2. Messenger can send messages internationally instantly, for free. Even those on free SMS packages will probably have to pay to send messages to people in another country, unless they have an international SMS package, which costs more.

3. Messenger is not limited in terms of message length.

4. Messenger can have inline images, videos, emoji, etc. SMS/MMS often has issues dealing with these kinds of things.

5. Group messaging, which is a huge feature that SMS does not have natively. There are solutions but they're not reliable and it usually depends on everyone owning the same phone.

6. Messenger does not require that you have the recipient's phone number, something that is becoming more and more archaic nowadays. You don't always want to give our your phone number to someone you want to talk to, anyway.

7. Messenger and most other IM clients have read receipts, so you can tell when your message has been delivered, when they have seen it, and when they are typing their response.

8. Messenger and most other IM clients also have the option of voice messages, which might seem stupid at first but once you start using them to communicate regularly you realise just how much more efficient they are.

9. Messenger and other IM clients are multiplatform, i.e. I can have Whatsapp on my phone, on my tablet, and the desktop client running on my PC. They're all synchronised and I can communicate no matter which device I'm using. SMS is restricted to your phone. Though there are solutions that allow you to route messages through your PC, you still need your phone.

10. IM clients are often encrypted. SMS is not.

11. Messenger and other IM clients usually have other social features built-in, for example being able to send someone a contact card with somebody's contact info, or instantly sending someone your location, or file attachment. Anyone who has ever lived in China will attest to the ridiculous number of extra features WeChat has, some more useful than others (including an electronic payment wallet that is accepted almost every store and restaurant and can be used to send money between friends, ordering and paying for services from taxis to dog grooming straight through the app, buying train/plane tickets directly through the app, managing investment portfolios, etc.)

There's 11 reasons off the top of my head, I could easily think of more but for me, those are all viable reasons to use an IM client over SMS.

The tl;dr of it all is that SMS is outdated tech that still has its uses. But why bother using a vastly inferior communications protocol rather than a specifically designed solution that addresses all of the weaknesses of SMS? Maybe if you're a luddite who wants to resist change for the sake of it, sure."	"I mean, I've tried a few Wisconsin cheeses, Vermont cheese, American Colby, American cheddar, Monterey jack, pepperjack, that kind of thing. I wasn't saying that all American cheeses are Kraft singles. Sorry if my post seemed to imply that.

But pretty much every American cheese I've tried, when compared with most British, European, or New Zealand cheeses, have been largely tasteless and mediocre at best. Even compared with a pretty basic mature/sharp English cheddar.

Having said that, I haven't tried any Californian cheeses, which are supposed to be pretty good. But then I was told that about Vermont and Wisconsin cheeses, which were super disappointing.

I stand by my original statement. There's good reason why the rest of the world do not import American cheeses unless there's a large American expat population living there. Whereas in the USA you no doubt get more imported cheeses than you can shake a stick at, particularly from places like France and Italy.

What we measure is how much oxygen is in the blood in each voxel (3d pixel). We have a pretty good idea of how neuron firing affects the blood oxygenation (on mobile, Wikipedia has a pretty good article on this, it's called the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent signal [BOLD]). So we can extrapolate, in a way that ranges from perfect representation, to slight conjecture, to misguided pseudoscience depending on who you ask... how active the brain tissue in that voxel is 

Your blood does in fact have water in it. But with a normal MRI, we need to ""excite"" the area we are imaging (mess with its magnetization)  and then measure how long it takes to go back to normal (""relaxation""). 

So since your blood is mostly flowing, a lot of the signal that would be in the blood doesn't really exist to the scanner since it was somewhere else when we excited the slice of your brain we are imaging.

Arterial spin labelling, that I mentioned above, will actually excite the water in your neck and then take the image in your brain so that we can see where the blood is going and how it's getting there.

714	"So I guess you didn’t actually read what I wrote. The teacher attempted to care for the dog. He took up this so-called burden of responsibility. However, the dog was past saving. So he killed the dog. You seem to want him to have driven to a vet’s office, waited to be seen, and then have the animal put down, prolonging its  suffering by hours so *you* can feel better. Let’s be honest, there would be a similar outcry if the teacher had snapped the dog’s neck, immediately killing it, in front of his pupils as well. 

If you care so much, why are you and others in this thread not banging down the door of every livestock farmer in this country and demanding change?

His ult is like a worse version of Axe's Call, his hook is like a worse version of Batrider ult and post 6.80 comeback exp became a thing and made Pudge's snowballing a lot less effective. It also doesn't help that his passive doesn't provide as much as it used to in a relative way. Everybody has more health now, but Pudge's skills have dropped in efficiency. Icefrog tried to combat that by upping the scaling of Dismember, but that didn't make up for everything he lost in relative effectiveness.

It used to be you could get a level advantage and prey on weak supports, but now everybody has a lot more HP and Pudge's damage hasn't been adjusted to compensate for it. Meat Hook does the same damage today as it did in Warcraft 3, but people have about 20% more health between level 1 and 6 and it only goes up from there. Supports are richer, get more levels, more items, can afford more wards, more regen... and Pudge's output hasn't been compensated.

Pudge has been left behind in the dust, but all Icefrog does is tinker around with the movement slow on rot... He either doesn't want the hero to be played or has no idea how to make the hero work.

Likely worse because side effects are undesirable effects caused by a medicine. Since women have the hormonal profiles induced by the pill naturally, the question of the negative effects of the female ocp relate to the maintenance of the hormonal state over time.

Also part of the jail system is that they have to work and the jobs they do are not exactly jobs people outside the jail want to do.

German jail is either keeping you locked up or makes you realize what you did is wrong and then makes you live with the knowledge that you did that wrong thing.

The EPA allows for 0.64 g/km of NOx+NMOG while Euro6 allows for 0.6 g/km of NOx.  It's disingenuous to say that one is more strict than the other because the US allows for more total emissions, but measures more pollutants.

The major difference between standards is that the US EPA treats diesel and gas engines the same vis-a-vis NOx while Euro# standards allowed for diesels to emit more pollution than petrol engines.  

This has been changing; Euro5 allowed diesels to emit 3x as much NOx, while Euro6 allows diesels to emit only 33% more NOx.

And however mental you may or may not think your chosen method is, if you are enjoying reading and getting a sense of fulfillment out of it then you are doing exactly the right thing..."	"As a metaphor, consider plugging electrical items into a socket - so to switch from one item to a second will involve turning off the first item, unplugging it, plugging in the second item, then switching the second item on. Simple enough, but there is a notable period in the middle where you are switching items and there is nothing active.
Instead consider having two plugs available - with your items plugged into a socket each, all you need to do is turn one off and turn the second on without having to unplug anything as you are doing it.
If you want to use a third item, you can then switch it over with your unused one in preparation for the next swap.

This is similar to a dual clutch gearbox - by having two clutches with one gear attached to each, shifting between them can be done far quicker as the gearbox does not have to move around the mechanical elements of the gearing at the same time, only activate and deactivate the clutches.

This is something that only really matters when you are considering high performance sports cars - driving a normal car around town, a typical driver can easily shift a (far slower to use) manual transmission more than fast enough to drive comfortably.

1/4 is your chance of getting heads or tails two times in a row, not the chance of getting heads or tails any particular time. "	"since there's so many systems that operate so differently, best I could do is give you a specific example.

Let's say my goal is to produce human protein X in an immortalized animal cell Y. 

1. Step 1 is getting a construct that can express human protein X. I would take human cells, extract the RNA, run a reverse-transcription reaction to turn mRNA into cDNA, PCR amplify the cDNA coding for protein X, and ligate the PCR product into an expression vector. 

2. Step 2 is preparing the delivery system. I may use a process called transfection to insert the expression vector into a cell line along with a viral packaging system. The host cell will produce the viral proteins and package the expression vector. The virions are then released from the cell. I would take the culture supernatant and filter it to remove any host cells or debris.

3. Step 3 is transducing the animal cell Y. Basically just mix the virus with the animal cell. The viruses don't have a copy of the full viral genome, only the expression vector and integration stuff. This is called a single round infection. The virus goes into the cell, produces integration machinery, and integrates a portion of the expression vector into the host genome. the vector may also carry a resistance gene, which allows me to poison and kill off cells that don't have an integration event. 

4. Step 4 is verifying the expression of protein X. This is typically done by Western blot. 

and that's it, I now have an animal cell that produces a human protein, forever. That's one form of genetic modification. "	explainlikeimfive	askscience	1

904	"So, here's the thing: Matricies are really difficult. It is hard to understand what a matrix will do just based on the numbers in it (getting harder as the dimension gets larger, as it does in many applications). Moreover, it is computationally expensive to do many important things with it, so we want a shortcut.

One of the most important thing about matricies is matrix multiplication. We can understand a lot about a matrix if we can understand how it interacts via matrix multiplication with other matrices. The important thing about determinants is that they, generally, preserve this multiplication. That is det(AB)=det(A)det(B). We're turning the difficult multiplication of matricies into the *easy* multiplication of numbers. We can then recover a lot of important things about a matrix based on what its determinant is, because the corresponding number will have similar properties. Is the matrix A invertible? Only if det(A) is invertible! Does the matrix A preserve length? Only if det(A) preserves length (ie, -1 or 1). Does the matrix A reverse orientation? Only if det(A) reverses orientation (ie is negative). 

This is a great computational heuristic. For example, we often want to find numbers t and vectors v so that Av=tv (applying A to v in this case is as simple as scalar multiplication). This works if there is a vector v so that (A-t\*Id)v=0. Or, there is such a v is A-t\*Id is not invertible. This is tough to determine directly, but we can use determinants to turn it into a question of numbers meaning we want to find the numbers t so that det(A-t\*Id)=0. The left is a polynomial, and we can find the zeros really easily of that. This kind of problem, an eigenvalue problem, is probably one of the most important and useful concepts in math and it works because the determinant has the special property that it preserves multiplication."	"Late to the game, but a significant one is the Local Langlands Theorem for GLn. The Langlands Program is a really big system of conjectures in Number Theory that link together a whole bunch of really importnat ideas. It's most general form is pretty inaccessible to mathematicians at the moment, but there have been some pretty key and important breakthroughs. One of which is the Local Langlands Correspondence for GLn. It was proved in 2001 by Michael Harris, Richard Taylor and others, and the proof is a few hundred pages long. Not particularly simple.

But in 2011, a young mathematician named Peter Scholze came up with a radical way of looking at the situation involved. Scholze re-proved the correspondence in a relatively short 37 page paper. Scholze is, overall, a total math badass."	explainlikeimfive	askscience	1

"I love my iphone X, so I'll touch on the faceid thing.

I think you focus a lot on talking poo because it's the primary place where it's actually visible.  The main benefits of faceid for me, are that it's almost invisible.

My SO looks at my phone, and there's a notification that says I have a new message from Fred.  I look at my phone, and it adds the first line of the message.  She doesn't see that, I do.  It's so smooth it took me a while to figure out it was even doing it.

When my alarm goes off, it goes quiet \(not off, just significantly quieter\) as soon as I'm looking at the screen.  It waits for me to action the alarm to actually dismiss it, but it chills out as soon as it knows I'm aware.  I wake up at 5am, so my SO appreciates this more than I do.

Logging into websites, the faceid logo flashes past before it unlocks the password from my keychain.  Not just on web forms, I've a few apps that use touchid/faceid to resume an existing login \(amazon, our weird oncall app for work, etc\), and it works there.  It's so frictionless that they had to add the double\-click thing to the appstore to stop purchases going through before you could read the price tag.

FaceID is a weird one because the better it works, the less you notice it.  If it's working perfectly it's hardly a feature at all.  This is a great example of the Apple I remember \- the best features are invisible.

It's funny that you mention your military background as the training is more similar to the combat training you give a soldier than for dealing with civilians.

Your proof is a documentary that you watched and you're calling me biased? Wtf?

Also, I don't think you know how a military base works. Depending on the base, the military police personnel will cover both inside the base, (which would typically be military personnel) and outside (which is civilian). You also forget that military personnel have dependents, which are civilian. You're also assuming that military personnel are void of any irrational thinking. How the heck are you gonna call me biased when you're saying things like you know better than me even though I SPECIFICALLY had to deal with the opposite of what you're telling me?

&gt; I'm sure they also ""teach"" deescalation techniques, but that is not the focus by any means.

How is it not? That was the exact discussion we're talking about.

&gt; How about the video of the man that politely and calmly informed the officer that he had a legally registered firearm in the vehicle, as would be protocol to inform the officer. He didn't reach for anything, the officer was just so threatened by the possibility of a black man being within reach of a firearm that he drew his gun and killed the man on the spot.

This is another thing you think you know about but you don't. The man wasn't shot because he said he had a gun on him. The man was shot after he said he had a gun on him when he was trying to reach for his ID. The officer perceived that as a threat.

&gt; He was instructed to do about 10 different things by different officers with contradictory instructions.

Still means nothing when that wasn't the reason why he got shot. He was also definitely not instructed by different officers at once. He was instructed by one.

&gt; Regardless of that, if you believe that ""reaching for your shorts"" constitutes shooting someone, you should live in the Philippines or North Korea.

Aaah, the good 'ol conservative ""IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GO LIVE IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY!"" argument. Here, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfi3Ndh3n-g. You'll find that reaching for shorts is justifiable.

&gt; There's no other first world country that tolerates the level of force, violence, and intimidation used by police in the U.S.

There's no other first-world country with this level of violence or capabilities to obtain weapons either. If a cops gotta deal with that, expect some shit to occur.

&gt; Not to mention racial profiling and corruption. It's a broken system that needs to be completely overhauled from the top down, and the inexplicably awful training given to police officers is the worst offender.

You still don't know jack shit about how cops are trained other than a documentary that is likely very biased. Racial profiling and corruption exists but probably not at the amount you think it does. In fact, that's probably the case since you believe all police officers are undertrained even though I've told you otherwise."	AdviceAnimals	videos	1

&gt; Rather, Bates claimed Karl and his group hadn’t followed NOAA protocol in “the way data was handled, documented and stored, raising issues of transparency and availability,” the AP reported, adding that Bates thought the study was rushed “to influence the December 2015 climate treaty negotiations in Paris.”

There is no amount of hypocrisy they won't endorse or join in. They are shameless. The idea that we can or should expect consistency from them is a cruel joke. They do what they want, regardless of fact or precedent.

45	"Im not sure if you are still answering questions, but in the hopes you are, I have a few I'd absolutely love to hear your opinion on. Im having a bit of a hard time nailing down a specific question, but if you have any thoughts on the subject I very much like to hear them.

First off, im familiar enough with machine learning, but it isnt my main area of expertise. My overall thoughts on machine learning are ""great, as long as you have a stationary set of events."" in short: ""you a want a machine that can handle these events, you get enough data on those events, and you train it.

What id love to hear your opinion on is: what about the non-stationary events. What about something it has never seen before. How can you train a machine to correctly deal with something it wasnt trained on / to ""handle the unexpected""?

From my point of view, it sort of seems like this is a bit of a glass ceiling in current machine learning research, as there is a fundamental difference between ""teaching a machine to teach itself how to do a specific task or set of tasks"" and ""teaching a machine to teach itself how to learn"". (personally I suspect that quantum computing is probably required to make the latter actually feasible, but that is a whole other topic).

Based on what Ive heard from a few different sources, it sounds like a lot of places are almost making backward progress on this, and are basically using the ""shotgun' approach to try things without any thought of *why* they should or shouldnt work, and then choosing whatever works for the task at hand without any thought as to what happens when it encounters a task it wasnt trained for."	In this case it might make a difference, but only if the media server is simultaneously supporting multiple streaming clients, which would in turn require accessing data from multiple different files at the same time.

It's clear you guys are going through some truly trying times at the moment, and only you two know if you're going to be able to weather the storm...but if you can, if it's truly meant to be...let me tell you, that feeling really is great.

I can't tell you how many conversations my wife and I have had concerning how we almost lost it. How happy we are now, and how we almost threw it away. To be quit honest, in retrospect we almost lost sight of our MARRIAGE, and began thinking about our individual happiness. Those really are two different things.  And the MARRIAGES that don't last, are often because individuals put too high a value on INDIVIDUAL happiness.  No marriage guarantees that, and people are mistaken if they think that's a reasonable expectation.
We often reminisce about an agreement we made BEFORE we got married and that was to have the highest commitment to our marriage.  This wasn't based on any religious or particularly high moral standard, it was simply to the principle that we should only get married once.  I remember telling my bride to be that I though we should take our marriage so seriously that we should be willing to fight for it, and that I fully expected there would be times that not only would we be mad at each other, but we might not even like each other, but we should care enough about the marriage to fight through those times for the marriages sake...thank goodness that happened.

I've now hat the great pleasure to watch three amazing children grow to adulthood with an intact, nuclear family (somewhat of a rarity these days)...well almost, still have a 16 year old lol, but he's on his way, I had the great pleasure to watch my wife graduate from college (with honors no less!) this past Dec to now start her amazing career in the medical field after putting her dreams on hold to raise our family and let me chase my career goals all these year.  It's nothing but a bright future ahead as far as i'm concerned..Oh, and I still find her just as sexy and beautiful as the day I met her..

And to think, we could have thrown this all away if we were foolish enough to believe that for some reason marriage = happiness at all times...it can be a job, like anything else.  But like most jobs, when you work hard at it, ya know, really put in the time, the payout can be worth the investment.

I truly wish the best for you and your husband, I hope he gets out of his funk, sooner rather than later, and I hope you guys look back on this time years down the road as just your little ""bump in the road"" and you use it to encourage others.

But I’m just saying, you’re acting like cash has no benefit whatsoever, I know most things are digital now and having cash isn’t the wisest way to go. But, since it’s my preference you’ve only said things to tell me how putting it in a bank is better. Well that’s your opinion, I feel as if having it in cash is better because it’s physically in front of me and not some number in some system. And some places give cash discounts. Everyone likes cash money because once it’s in your hand it’s there. No waiting a day for it to post, no one sees my money but me. I don’t like the fact that anyone could access my money at anytime if they really wanted to. 

To say hackers can’t get to your money is underestimating the fact that people who do that are 10 steps ahead of the security measures used my banks. I’m just removing the possibility of getting hacked. A bank is a bigger target than I am. I live in the country and can protect myself from a thief with the guns I have. And I see the possibility of a fire is way smaller than the possibility of a hacker simply because banks are just waiting to get hacked or robbed one day. I’m not, thus why my money is in cash. 

If my preference is cash, it shouldn’t upset you that much. No reason to tell me things I already know. I’m just simply stating I prefer cash, regardless of any benefits storing it in a bank might have. "	I mean you’re supposed to change your passwords to anything important every 3 months.

75	"DAVID!

The domain is https://thewayitwas.uk/david-lewis-hodgson-sixties-photojournalist/

First off: you seem like a genuine bad-ass-m*therf*cker. Do you miss those days or are you grateful for having survived?

I recently began entertaining the possibility of pursuing photojournalism and fashion photography; my inner cynic is telling me that the future for journalism looks bleak - in a sense. Journalists are receiving less compensation, less protection, and so on...  Any thoughts?

What are your thoughts on the current vs the past state of journalism &amp; photo-journalism? What are your opinions about people such as Sebastian Junger, Tim Hetherington, Don McCullin, Marie Colvin &amp; Paul Conroy, etc.?

I'm left with the impression that the state of today's journalism is completely different than what it was yesterday. It all seems quite romanticized -- in hindsight. 

Sorry for all of the questions, but it's not every day that we have the opportunity to pick the brains of people such as yourself. "	"As someone trying to get started in fashion photography: TIL what an 8/11 portfolio is. Thanks for that!

To give you an idea of a typical Instagram feed's image size/resolution: here's a link to one of Pryana Chopra's latest images , from her feed. https://scontent-bru2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/64fdc6667ae01461f118c6e627161a2c/5B46623B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/28432663_445610499192407_5531525467561000960_n.jpg

It's not bad. I'm not certain as to whether or not it would print out nicely at 8*11. Should it not be the right size, you could always try squeezing two images onto one sheet instead of blowing up one shot and having it look off. 

Instagram MIGHT have higher resolution images stored on their servers, and they MIGHT share them with you. We're talking about two hypotheticals as far as that goes; but, I would absolutely start saving/scraping those images off of those Instagram feeds ASAP, and start the quality control process asap. Just know that the screengrabs you currently have are going to give you a much lower quality image resolutions than the method that I'm suggesting.

Figure out if you can do anything with the Pryanka's image for the moment. Try printing it (try black &amp; white as it won't be as printer ink/toner intense). 

Take what I'm saying with a grain of salt and please verify this, but I think your modeling talent, portfolio quality, and personality traits are factors which are ultimately going to weight more than whether or not your portfolio's format matches that of everyone else's. 

Sorry to hear about the bad news. Hope you get this sorted!"	IAmA	photography	1

""Assume good intent"" is how they fuck us over. People who do not engage in honest faith discourse can easily manipulate a system without defenses.  Much how viruses infect unsuspecting hosts.

You're right in that we can't just accuse and blindly accept accusations as fact, but nor can we simply assume all people are good when we have witnessed at *least* two strong nations fall to these very tactics (Britain with Brexit and the US with Trump). 

We can't be naive, so we must remain civil. *Anyone* attempting to sow discord must be treated as hostile, and only logical discourse should be tolerated. 

To that note, we then have to be extremely vigilant about logical fallacies, as those who master propaganda know how to present lies that fall very close to the truth, but with nuanced distortions. The reason this new age of internet propaganda is so effective is because they (the Russians) are using lessons they have learned in interrogation during wartime against completely unprepared civilians. They are mastering a craft we are woefully underprepared to deal with.

Giving these people the benefit of the doubt plays into their hands.

Also letting them make us fully paranoid plays into their hands.

"3D Character Artist here. There's not really a ""converging"" that could happen - both use the same pipeline with film cutting corners on optimization because it doesn't have to.

The differences exist to fit the medium and how it necessitates certain constraints of processes, rather than differences existing because of industry politics or other influencers.

Pox faulds could actually be better than hellcat - as hellcat with 5 bounces means slow killing and it is a little bit annoying IMO. Pox faulds are easier to get so I'd start with them. But could be the other way around.

I got all 3 items last season at level 1, usable at level 16 though.

&gt;Max out your Smith and enchantress and start crafting lvl 70 weapons, trying to get level reduction (can roll up to 30 level reduction). if you do not get level reduction right away, an item that has % chance as a secondary is good as well. 

For DHs - don't craft bows or xbows. They often roll discipline - which makes it very hard to get a level reduction weapon. Craft Swords. Grenades, Chakram and FoK don't need a ranged weapon anyways. 

I think lvl 60 weapons can also roll with lvl reduction. Craftable at 42 or so.

D3 changed dramatically since launch with regards to improving on the loot system, and it is much MUCH better than it used to be (remember finding an IK piece after 200 hours of a3 inferno with int, dex, gold pickup radius, thorns, and nothing else?)...

The story-boarding for the last few episodes has been insane and on point, they wouldn't have put Levi there instead of Rod for no reason.

It wouldn't be weird. Seeing his face rather what he's looking at is a common tool to create suspense because we don't know what he's scared at. It's similar to his shocked face when fighting Female Titan before she chopped his head off. We knew it was FT before him, but we didn't see Annie's fighting style that he recognized in that moment.

Usually in anime if a character is scared because he said shit about another character behind him, he would freeze like Eren but side-eyeing said character.

The average Christian does not have all the answers. 

The thing I can only emphasize is that one is not saved through knowledge in the existence of God. As we often like to quote James 2:19, even the devils believe that God exists. 

You are saved by faith, loyalty to Christ, following him. He is the way to the Father. Noone can come to the Father but through him. Jesus reveals to us who God is. 

But these revelations go hand in hand with being asked to follow. All the times God reveals himself to people like Mary or Abraham or Moses, the Prophets...it is always with a purpose, a task for them. Not just so that they know him and be saved. The times God reveals himself just to be known (e.g. with Pharao and the Egypts) are usually times where they will feel God's wrath and judgement.

Now our only quest is to follow Christ. So if you want to have a revelation of God's love, then there is no way around Jesus."

Nerfing her range frees up power budget to focus on her other strengths. 

Also, I agree it affects muscle memory, but so does literally any nerf. If you nerfed her damage, for instance, maybe dedicated mains would have spent a few weeks accidentally ulting people away and leaving them with a sliver of health.

"The wall and storm's end (and Winterfell) was built by Brandon the Builder with the help of the COTF and the giants, not valyrian magic. But my objection is that not that they *can't* be built, but that they *wouldn't* be built. An 800ft/200ft wall sounds cool, but it's a strategic clusterfuck. From an 800ft wall you could *never* hope to fire at invaders below with any degree of accuracy. Communication from top to bottom would be nigh impossible and ridiculously inefficient. Hadrian's Wall in our world is 15 feet at its highest, and that was *actually* used to repel attackers. The great wall of China is 25ft high and that's because the Chinese were fucking tech geniuses around this time in comparison to the rest of the world. 




Maintaining a wall like that would cost the income of a small country on a regular basis. I could say the same about Winterfell and Storm's end. Apparently the walls at Storm's end are 40ft thick. And Winterfell is basically a stone well. No one would build structures like that in the first place cos of how illogical they are.

169	Well written friend! We could always use more like you over in askhistorians! Anyone who values well written informative accounts of history is welcome	The easy answer is yes, it is more profitable to sell additional features than to include them for free but the harder to swallow answer has more to do with development than it does corporate. Major games these days have a lot more competition, and they stand out usually by advertising features. As a developer you want all your players to at least be aware of (if not interacting with) every aspect of the game you make. Where tony hawk pro skater 2 had hidden levels and cheat codes to play as spiderman, thats dead. And its not just because you want players to get to it, but games back then were not treated with the same professionalism as they are now. THPS2 was made with a team of about 180 people, working under a major publisher like activision, and had a development cost estimated under $2 million. Remember, those cheat codes and secret levels and characters still have to be programmed and debugged and licensed and everything. Compared to Gran Turismo 5, estimates say that it cost roughly $60 million excluding marketing costs. That game came out only ten years after THPS2, and its almost a decade old now. Costs to devlop have only continued to rise and rise and rise, with ever tighter release windows with increasingly complex code. Introducing a hidden level costs assloads of money and time to make now, for no guarantee it will ever be found, and it creates potential for game breaking bugs. An increased focus on multiplayer connectivity makes it thrice as hard, because you have to make sure that cheats can't carry over into multiplayer.

202	"&gt;What this person is saying is that when evaluated on closer to equal starting platforms (having a sample size of people who regularly exercise, instead of all people), females and males perform at relatively equal levels for reaction time and hand to eye coordination. As they explained, this differentiation must be made because as a society, women are not only less physically inclined towards sports (being usually physically inferior to men), but also are not pushed in that direction by mentors or offered any incentives to pursue that type of career.

That's not really a 'closer to equal' starting platform though because like I said you could be polling what would essentially amount to the 'upper half' of woman vs most of the men. That study, in particular, wasn't linked and I'd really be curious to see exactly what they were controlling for.

Also, I'm pretty sure it was only mentioned for reaction time, not hand-eye coordination.

Unfortunately, you're right that there doesn't seem to be a lot of data on these things, but I feel like the eye test can be can be pretty telling. Like, just curious is there any woman athlete that you've seen that you really think is as sharp as the best male player in their sport, mechanically? 

Not only that but now with the rise of eSports and video games there is a lot of an anecdotal evidence that seems to exist as these types of games rely heavily on reaction time, hand-eye, etc and are virtually completely male dominated. Pretty much exclusively male at the highest level barring very few women.

&gt;To me this is as ridiculous a stance as the garbage that that Google employee spouted a few months ago - that women's brains are not made as well for programming or other tech careers as men's are.

I'm just curious why that would be such a ridiculous stance? We know that men and women are different physiologically and psychologically. And we know there is no true separation of the body and the mind. We're all just organ and tissue so why would it be hard to believe that based on differences in the brain there would be varying aptitudes?

I actually don't see how there's any evidence at all for that not being true. It seems more to me that pretty much the lions share of the evidence points in that direction, but people continually like to reference small exceptions, which are perfectly explained by varience. 

I mean the Google case is just another example where men do excel in math and logic (like *actual* logic) compared to women, which are both large parts of programming. Not only do we have evidence that men excel in these areas at the level of the brain, but the data in majors like math and philosophy also back up these finding. The graduates are predominantly male, as well as those entering into the program. That's exactly what we'd expect to find.

Then there is also how IQ is distributed between males and females. Again, looking at that it's no surprise that you see more men in math and philosophy (which are among the majors that seem to demand the highest IQ, closely followed by engineering/comp sci)

The thing that I don't get though is why these claims are met with such hostility. What *nobody* is saying is that women, under no circumstances, should be allowed in these positions. I mean, if you have a doctorate in mathetics from MIT and you've done important research nobody is going to question your ability to do math. 

You're going to have an opportunity to prove yourself competent every step of the way. It seemed to me that his memo was more specifically addressing people who were hired by some type of arbitrary quota and turned out *not* to be competent.

-Leave the glove compartment open and the console so that people know there is nothing worth stealing
-Get a one of those locks for your steering wheel

269	"They'd have to have worked on it to a much greater degree, much earlier, and stuck with it for that to happen.

Apple *did* release a game console, the [Pippin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin), in 1996. It failed, and in fact was officially shut down when Steve Jobs ended Macintosh clones in 1997.

It wasn't just a matter of making more competitive gaming hardware, though. I have firsthand experience with how shitty G3 and G4 Macs were for gaming, as I did have a Power Mac G4 for gaming around 2002-2006. They were expensive, underpowered, with an extremely limited selection of both graphics cards and compatible games. But that's not the real reason why Mac gaming is bad.

The main thing Apple needed to have done, if they wanted to keep gaming relevant on the Mac, would be to push harder for OpenGL to be the standard graphical API instead of DirectX, and to push for performance improvements to keep it viable for gaming and not just professional applications. In the early days of DirectX, there was still some competition between it, OpenGL, and 3dfx Glide, but DirectX won and being a Windows-only API, it meant that most games were Windows-only. ~~Plus, DirectX has always been focused on gaming, so it's faster than OpenGL.~~

Now Apple is even letting OpenGL stagnate. While they do officially support it, they only support an older version, and they're pushing for their own proprietary Metal API instead. No major games are going to support Metal, so Mac games just use OpenGL, which has poor performance now compared with DirectX.

It would have taken a lot of effort from Apple to make the Mac a viable gaming platform. Hell they could have probably licensed DirectX from Microsoft, but that's obviously nothing that Jobs would have considered. Now that Macs can boot into Windows, there's no real reason to try to make Mac gaming good - if you want to play games, just reboot into Windows and play there."	"This.

275	"For the following points feel free to replace 'Messenger' with any IM app of your choice (Whatsapp, Telegram, Viber, Line, Skype, WeChat, iMessage, etc.)

1. Messenger is free, just requires wifi/data connection. A lot of carriers in the US offer free SMS (or at least some free SMS), but that is not the case everywhere. Besides, generally if you're on an unlimited SMS package, you are paying more for that feature.

2. Messenger can send messages internationally instantly, for free. Even those on free SMS packages will probably have to pay to send messages to people in another country, unless they have an international SMS package, which costs more.

3. Messenger is not limited in terms of message length.

4. Messenger can have inline images, videos, emoji, etc. SMS/MMS often has issues dealing with these kinds of things.

5. Group messaging, which is a huge feature that SMS does not have natively. There are solutions but they're not reliable and it usually depends on everyone owning the same phone.

6. Messenger does not require that you have the recipient's phone number, something that is becoming more and more archaic nowadays. You don't always want to give our your phone number to someone you want to talk to, anyway.

7. Messenger and most other IM clients have read receipts, so you can tell when your message has been delivered, when they have seen it, and when they are typing their response.

8. Messenger and most other IM clients also have the option of voice messages, which might seem stupid at first but once you start using them to communicate regularly you realise just how much more efficient they are.

9. Messenger and other IM clients are multiplatform, i.e. I can have Whatsapp on my phone, on my tablet, and the desktop client running on my PC. They're all synchronised and I can communicate no matter which device I'm using. SMS is restricted to your phone. Though there are solutions that allow you to route messages through your PC, you still need your phone.

10. IM clients are often encrypted. SMS is not.

11. Messenger and other IM clients usually have other social features built-in, for example being able to send someone a contact card with somebody's contact info, or instantly sending someone your location, or file attachment. Anyone who has ever lived in China will attest to the ridiculous number of extra features WeChat has, some more useful than others (including an electronic payment wallet that is accepted almost every store and restaurant and can be used to send money between friends, ordering and paying for services from taxis to dog grooming straight through the app, buying train/plane tickets directly through the app, managing investment portfolios, etc.)

There's 11 reasons off the top of my head, I could easily think of more but for me, those are all viable reasons to use an IM client over SMS.

The tl;dr of it all is that SMS is outdated tech that still has its uses. But why bother using a vastly inferior communications protocol rather than a specifically designed solution that addresses all of the weaknesses of SMS? Maybe if you're a luddite who wants to resist change for the sake of it, sure."	"It's a pretty good one! Understandable if you've never seen 'fathom' written out.

What Happened to 'Blade'?](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/blade-started-a-revolution-was-abandoned-by-marvel-1135703)

In a nutshell, Blade came in the same era as Howard the Duck (1986) and Straight-to-video releases The Punisher (1989), Captain America (1990) and then there was the matter of the unreleased The Fantastic Four (1994). It gave Marvel some juice but it wasn't ""MCU"" really.

Don't get me wrong, I *definitely* think the whole Black Panther is black empowerment focus from Marvel Disney was (genius) marketing and opportunistic capitalism, as much as I feel the results of that movies portrayal of black people as intelligent and heroes of their own story had a real impact on change and DEFINITELY altered the zeitgeist on ""black"" movies, turning them into ""just movies"". But I don't think suppressing Blade was in any way some scheme to change the face of black firsts from Marvel or anything.

I mean Blade was the first somewhat hit from an (at the time) struggling comic book company who had a string of garbage and flops in cinema in a time when super hero movies wasn't a genre itself but a subset of action and/or comedy."

332	"He did answer your question.  You have to look at the data for your business.  There is no one answer.  The government set a standard of 40 hours so that gives us a starting point.  If you need someone in the storefront or answering calls, reducing your hours could reduce customer contact and reduce sales (though looking at your hourly sales may indicate that you do not make enough sales from 8-9 to be open or Monday afternoons are always dead).  If your business is to get the most widgets made and out the door, then you could experiment with 90 days of 7 hour work days and see if the widget numbers are reduced, and if so, is it enough to matter.  If your business is to complete projects, once again, you can look at projects completed in a trial period and see if the lost time makes an impact.  If productivity is way down, you go back to 40 hours.  If it is about the same or insignificantly decreased, you keep the new schedule, or maybe even try another 90 day trial of a lower schedule.

There is no one answer.  It will not be the same for every industry and not even the same for every company within an industry.  The business needs to be willing to innovate and allow the data to guide what is best for them."	"If we look at people doing a bed rest study where they do not move for many weeks, we do not see a change in sleep.  We also do not see much differences in sleep for people with quadriplegia.  If you exercise, you will see an increase in slow wave sleep (delta activity), but if you put a misting fan on the person so that their body temperature does not increase during exercise, there is no change in sleep.

Delta activity is strongest in the frontal cortex where much of the mental activity of the brain occurs.  If you put a person's hand on a vibrating platform so that you stimulate the somatosensory cortex corresponding to the hand, you will see increased delta activity in that same region of the brain.  If you take a person out for a stimulating day, they will have increased slow wave sleep. 

This all points to that slow wave sleep is related to brain activity, not mental activity. "	business	askscience	1

350	"Lack of sleep results in a decline in your cognitive abilities, and grows more severe the longer you go without adequate sleep. 

There are two ways in which this can occur: acute total sleep deprivation or chronic partial sleep restriction. The former means prolonged wakefulness for a large amount of time, with little or no moments of sleep. The latter is much more common in our society, and is when you are getting less than a proper night's sleep for several days in a row. 

Total sleep deprivation first leads to mild cognitive impairment: decline in spacial awareness, difficulty focusing, and working memory. As the impacts of total sleep deprivation compound, decision-making and even long-term memory experience adverse changes. 

Partial sleep deprivation, particularly in regards to partial sleep restriction, impacts your attention, spacial awareness, and emotion regulation. Chronic partial sleep restriction can be slightly alleviated by getting more rest (or ""catching up on sleep"") but will be just as bad once you go back to restricted sleep schedules that are less than adequate. So sleeping in on Saturday and Sunday may feel great, but you'll be depriving yourself of sleep right when you get back to your weekly sleep schedule (or lack thereof). 

My favourite source on this subject: [Alhola, P., &amp; Polo-Kantola, P. (2007). Sleep deprivation: Impact on cognitive performance.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2656292/)"	"I could give a very long answer, but I'll keep it short. 

1. Ethiopia as it exists is a very young country, only [a couple decades old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Civil_War). Since then, it has had [regular political unrest](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/28/589090717/in-ethiopia-bitter-social-conflict-plays-out-on-the-soccer-field) and continuous issues of [government corruption](https://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/ethiopia/). 
2. Economically, politically, and socially, Ethiopia has faced [ instability](http://addisstandard.com/commentary-ethiopias-unstable-political-landscape-unstable-region/) as different factions keep trying to take control of the resources of the country. There is good likelihood that artifacts recovered will be sold off to highest bidders. 
3. Some say ""Well Addis Ababa is very civilized and modern, these should be safe there!"" to which I note that the government has randomly arrested [journalists, teachers, and other political dissidents](https://www.opride.com/2018/03/27/massive-crackdown-overshadows-political-reform-and-new-prime-minister-election-in-ethiopia/) and will seize people's property if they find it valuable. So giving it to universities or private entities alike will not guarantee it stays there. 
4. Lastly, Ethiopia has made MANY human rights violations in recent years, and have [indescriminately killed](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/ethiopia) citizens in the hundreds. 


So to those who say ""They should have the artifacts because they're brown"" I would argue that my priority is not with the color of skin or even cultural heritage, but on ensuring that artifacts significant to humanity be kept safe. 

If they can be kept safe in Addis Ababa, then by all means send them there. But we have VERY good reason to believe they will not be safe there. "	science	worldnews	1

Pretty sure it's too big for a BA in Occupational Therapy though."	"Kids here get into daycare by age 1 at the latest (that's when they're guaranteed a place, but it's possible to get them in earlier). It means both parents can go back to work after they've both taken their parental leaves, and the kids definitely gain from it from a developmental perspective.

They socialize with other children and build relationships to adults, they get incredibly many opportunities to develop all kinds of gross and fine motor skills; staying at home (in a nourishing environment, obviously) is by no means detrimental to these skills early on, but one simply can not provide the same quantity and variety of experience as a good daycare can.

Really the only ""counterargument"" I can think of is in case of children who might be flooded in daycare if they're introduced to it too early (either insecure-difficult or slow children), but in those cases it should be a goal to work towards introducing the child to daycare.

In my opinion, it's the natural thing to do nowadays... Women have (pretty much) always had aid in raising children in one form or another.

388	I am beginning to think that they will pull a walmart in this scenario. They simply cannot stop their operations on a whim. Walmart had a situation with meat packers and trying to start a union. They eliminated the meat packer jobs entirely in the stores and sent them to distribution centers. Employees at a walmart store tried to start a union, so walmart closed the entire store for six months so they couldn't really strike. The teamsters are about to find out what happens when you screw with the big dog investors. UPS could hire a company as contractors for delivering the packages. They wear the uniforms but don't actually work for UPS. USPS does this with overseas jobs on military bases to save money. So by saying all that, I think this union is barking up a wrong tree. It will cause a massive shift towards contracting out the delivery job rather than increasing employee pay.	The future will be near-field libraries.

"If we look at people doing a bed rest study where they do not move for many weeks, we do not see a change in sleep.  We also do not see much differences in sleep for people with quadriplegia.  If you exercise, you will see an increase in slow wave sleep (delta activity), but if you put a misting fan on the person so that their body temperature does not increase during exercise, there is no change in sleep.

Delta activity is strongest in the frontal cortex where much of the mental activity of the brain occurs.  If you put a person's hand on a vibrating platform so that you stimulate the somatosensory cortex corresponding to the hand, you will see increased delta activity in that same region of the brain.  If you take a person out for a stimulating day, they will have increased slow wave sleep.

What then happened was that the Swedish military intervened and pulled everything out (blueprints, etc, I guess), to give it to SAAB for future development. That whole thing was interesting from many points of view, but now my point was that military technology only leaks out slowly into civil society.

These studies have also shown up to a 3-4x higher rate of autism diagnosis in families with members predominantly in these fields, indicating potential (unconcious) selection for autistic traits.*

Autism has also been shown, via brain mapping (citing the studies of test subject / autistic professor Temple Grandin), in recent years to be linked to drastic changes in the brain. Case in point, Albert Einstein's brain was preserved after his death; noted to be ""drastically different"" in some regards; and is still intensely studied by scientists today. These ""drastic differences"" are theorized to be the reason as to why these individuals are so different in their thinking."	"According to the research I've done, Disney still had a 70%+ market share on the Orlando theme park industry in February 2015. That constitutes a large monopoly and dominant presence. Statistics also show that it takes, and took, several years for Universal to even gain a few to several percent in the same market share, due to Disney's monopoly.

Even then, the main reason for Universal's success, and increased market share, was solely due to the building of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park expansion(s). Before WWOHP's existence, the Universal theme parks had been badly underfunded and poorly managed, neglected by the brand's parent companies. 

&gt; In terms of market share, Disney remains dominant, with 71.2%. But is has lost nearly 4% since 2009 to Universal, which increased its market share from 16% to 21.6% [by 2015].

&gt; (*Source: [""Theme Park Wizards: How 'Harry Potter' is Changing the Face of Tourism""](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2zd830/theme_park_wizards_how_harry_potter_is_changing/) by Jason Garcia for Florida Trend Magazine*)

As for ""doing anything unsavory or illegal"", Disney literally directly copied J.K. Rowling's management of, and approach to, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter (WWOHP) at Universal Studios / Islands of Adventure in Orlando. They did so in the planning and building their own Galaxy's Edge theme park expansion for *Star Wars* in Walt Disney World's Hollywood Studios.

You can’t take care of that child, you wouldn’t have to go through 9 months of pregnancy that you didn’t want with all of the potential for risk, complications, lost wages, and healthcare costs. A woman terminating a pregnancy literally has nothing to do with you.

It’s an inane argument that completely ignores tread wear. As long as all 4 tires have a decent amount of tread remaining, you’re not going to have a noticeable performance difference between the tire with 6mm of tread and the tire with 7mm of tread.

&gt;Judas goats were sterilized and injected with hormones to make them permanently in estrus (heat). These unwitting traitors were then set free around the islands, irresistible bait for the fugitives. By 2006, Project Isabela had eliminated all goats from the target areas.

At the end of the day, employees are valuable for the work they perform, not because they’re willing to go bowling with coworkers.

Anyway, if you're interested in getting into listening to podcast, one suggestion I'll make is to download the [pocketcasts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/) app. Along with letting you listen on your phone and computer, it also lets you search top and trending podcasts based on either popularity or genre. 

Some of the AAA podcasts include: 

This American Life - investigative journalism/social commentary

Stuff You Should Know - Learn cool things and cool topics. 

Freakonomics Radio - A deep dive into how economics and data shape the world around us in the strangest ways. 

WTF with Marc Maron - Deep and personal conversations with comedians and pop culture icons. 

Joe Rogan Experience - Think WTF but with a few more controversial figures mixed in. I'll admit, I can't stand Joe Rogan. I think he's a bit of an ass/ignorant and people put his podcast on way too high of a pedestal, but that's my personal taste. You may like him. 

Lore - Learn about mysterious happenings throughout history. 

Those are just some of the biggest name titles. If you're looking for more niche stuff, some of my personal favorites include: 

**Nerdom**

Critical Role - Professional voice actor Mat Mercer and friends play D&amp;D 

Shut Up and Sit Down - SU&amp;SD discusses table top games that they enjoy or hate. 

Epic Audio - Serialized audio epics. Not the best writing in the world, but I find the stories enjoyable. 

**Horror**

Creepy - Audio productions of the most popular creepy pastas. Pretty hit and miss, as most creepy pastas are, but when it it hits, it hits really well. 

Black Tapes - A reporter and a skeptic get involved in a demonic mystery. 

No Sleep Podcast - Scary stories. 

**Conspiracy and Craziness**

Beyond the Darkness - If you like conspiracy theories about aliens, ghosts, bigfoot, or whatever else you can think of, this one is the go-to. 

Mysteries Abound - Think Beyond the Darkness, but with a more soothing host. 

**News and Journalism**

Pretty self-explanatory, so I won't give a description of each. 

BBC Newshour 

Reveal 

New York Times The Daily

NPR Up First

Guardian Long Read 

**Pop Culture**

Almost all of these come from one podcast network, so I'm sure there are others out there, but I really like Frogpants and the hosts they have. 

Film Sack - Think the podcast version of Mystery Science Theater. 

The Morning Stream - a daily chit-chat about pop culture and general fun. 

Boop - a look at the video game industry. 

Like I said, there are a billion different things out there, and I've left some of my favorites off this list, along with other big names you'll probably hear. 

But, if you get into listening enough, you'll find your niche and the most recommended podcasts within those niche's pretty easily. Like I said, the best recommendation I can make is for that app, which I don't work for or anything, but I swear by it.

Do you have a source for this? Because I know people who are much more productive when they smoke."	"Hey, I wanted to give you an update, since I made some talent changes since I posted on Tuesday.

I ended up swapping Feed the Demon (Tier 4) with Fracture and it made quite the difference. Turns out that Fracture acts a lot like Demon Spikes, so you have two charges that independently drop off cooldown, so even with one charge left, it's recharging back to two. That ultimately meant a lot less rotation downtime than expected. I kept the Void Reaver (Tier 7) trait for the time being because even with this change, Soul Cleave is still used.

New rotation is (after jumping in) Fracture, Fracture (generating 4 fragments, putting you at max if you traited in Fallout), Spirit Bomb, then Soul Cleave to use up any unused pain leftover (Soul Cleave doesn't require soul fragments, so you can use it as long as you have enough Pain).

So, I stand corrected on the idea that there's less to press. There may be a slight dead time, but it's nowhere near as bad as I thought. Throw Glaive can even fill that downtime until Fracture is up.

Difficulty continues to go up - I'm at 117 and some enemies are starting to hit hard in dungeons, but the DH seems to be faring pretty well so far, some of that attributed to the new rotation."	science	wow	1

521	"&gt;Would a Dad with a 8 month old baby be able to enjoy a game like this?

Sure. You can sit down and play for 10 minutes *or* 10 hours. With the new missions structures, free roam, and bounty systems you can spend as little time or as much time as you want and still make progress.

I often play while i cook, and that forces me to stop playing every 5 minutes to make sure the food doesnt burn. But even without pausing, the generous 50 minute time limit on every quests means you can take breaks even in the middle of quests. And most missions will not take beyond 15-20 minutes, especially if you play online with half decent players.

Previous titles were big in Japan *because* you could play Monster Hunter for short periods of time and still make progress. Lunch breaks, on the bus, in the cubicle while waiting for more work, the missions structure isnt ""run this dungeon thats 3 hours long"". Its, ""Spend 5 to 30 minutes per quest, and choose what you want to do"". With world, you cant do that on the go, but with an 8 month old baby you're probably spending a lot of time with 30 feet of the TV anyway.

You can *very* easily in 15-20 minute chunks off and on throughout the day. If you end up with more time, you can play longer. If you end up with less time, you can just free roam with *infinite time* to do things and *no fail conditions.*

I wont say, ""This is the perfect game for a person with an 8 month old baby"", but Monster Hunter has always been a series of, ""Let me sneak in a 10 minute quest while no one is looking"". And world does that *better* than previous games."	"Its amazing in terms of tone and atmosphere, and its *very unique*. There is nothing else like it on the market right now. Its a constant juggling act of risk, reward, combat, and procedurally generated exploration that can throw you from elation and pride, to the 5 stages of grief in a single combat round. 

Good play and risk management can lead to many successful outings, but must like XCOM a single slip can turn a mission tits up and recovery from such a thing can easily take hours, if not days to recover from (if its even possible).

I highly recommend you play it if you love grim dark aesthetic, challenges of skill *and* knowledge that you will accrue over many long, potentially unsuccessful runs, and a wee bit of sadomasochism to see your pawns in the most dire situations that only your quick thinking and lady luck can pull them out of."

536	"&gt;but I would prefer that they crtitiicized both sides.

But that's the problem. Each individual issue doesn't have ""both sides"". Sometimes we don't know the truth and experts can disagree, but that disagreement isn't binary. Politics in America involves a two party system due to our winner take all system, but that is not how reality works. And sometimes we do know the answer and 'both sides' is diluting the truth, not strengthening it.

The President attacked the free press this morning. That's a truth that shouldn't be 'both sides'ed. Bringing up how in 2017 a reporter from CNN factually reported that he and the Prime Minister dumped fish flakes as if this is some sort of 'counter-point' to a direct attack on a free media, is emblematic of the problem. 

""Both sides""ing is how we got to this place. Honesty even when it draws outrage is how we get out.

&gt;Overall, I just prefer news to be in the middle, rather than spew left or right propoganda.

There is literally no such thing as a 'middle' in terms of political opinion. Everyone's 'middle' is a purely subjective construct from where they stand. While there are some basic factual disagreements (climate change, health care costs, conspiracy theories) almost all of it is a matter of values. And demanding the news place their values in the middle of people who want gay people accepted, or suppressed, want unions busted, or supported, who don't care about corruption, and who do, is how you get the media to the weakened point it's in now.

Trump should never have been elected. Regardless of the racial and economic factors he was playing to, if we'd had an honest media discussion of exactly what the man is like, he wouldn't have been elected. He has always been a joke and a criminal, an admitted sexual predator and an imbecile for every matter of substantive policy. But the media did what you asked. They simply reported facts about what candidates did, and whenever Trump was criticized, they felt they had to 'both sides' it, even if that meant bringing on people who'd just lie to defend him, or criticizing Hillary when it had no merit. 

Honest journalism means you don't align your speech to what the other person considers moderate to them, or pretend both sides of every argument should be given equal weight. 

The President attacked the free press. Can't we actually talk about that and it's consequences, instead of making the exact same mistake that got us here, by hand-wringing that honest journalists who are trying should maybe be less critical for the sake of appearances?"

It could be that his heart wasn't really in it all along and he realized at the end he just couldn't turn his back on his life and what he wanted, maybe the extra $20K was a turning point - maybe it's important to him to feel that valued by his employer. It's hard to wrap your self worth up in someone else's dream. Just like you couldn't stay in Maryland for him, he couldn't move to Florida with you, even though it sounds like he tried. I think in the end he just couldn't go through with it even if he really wanted to be with you. It's a difficult conversation for him to have with you, it sucks all around. You're not wrong to be upset with him, but he might have been wrestling with some feelings on this as well. Eventually you'll probably talk and know more.

This is an efficient process as the microwaves bounce around the cavity until absorbed by something, which should be the substance you are cooking.

An oven cooks by hot air as well as infra-red. But it heats the entire oven cavity, which then also loses heat to the outside.  This is less efficient way to get heat into food, however the higher temperatures at the food boundary do cause more of the Maillard reactions that we associate with cooking flavour.

575	"To understand what GitHub is, first you need to know what Git is. Git is a tool created for developers to be able to track changes to their programs in a systematic and logical way. If you've ever had to do a project and ended up having a bunch of files like PROJECT.DOC, PROJECTv2.DOC, PROJECT_FINAL.DOC, PROJECT_TRUE_FINAL.DOC, you can understand the importance of having a way to track versions of a project. These systems are called version control, and Git is a popular one because in addition to this, it also allows for smooth collaboration so that multiple people can collaborate on a project easily (and not end up with PROJECT.DOC and PROJECTv2.DOC on John's computer, PROJECTv2.DOC and PROJECTv3.DOC on Ryan's computer, and PROJECTv2.DOC and PROJECT_FINAL.DOC on Mike's computer). 

Git is decentralized by design; a ""master version"" of the project doesn't sit on any one computer. However, sometimes it's nice to have something that would roughly correspond to a ""master version"", especially for large projects with lots of online contributors, hence the creation of GitHub. GitHub is basically a place where a project can sit as an easily accessible de-facto master version and people can pull and push updates to it in an organized fashion. Git is the underlying technology, but GitHub and friends (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) provides the service of free code hosting for many projects.

One thing that makes GitHub very attractive is that open source software can use it for free. If you don't know what open source software is, suffice it to say that it's software with a greater amount of freedom for its use than traditional proprietary software like Windows. GitHub is incredibly popular for open source developers who generally aren't particularly fond of Microsoft, mostly due to historical squabbles. Some are worried about what will happen to GitHub with Microsoft behind the wheel, some are worried about what will happen to the Atom code editor which is a separate program owned by GitHub the company, which is popular but is also a direct competitor for a Microsoft projects. Some are not worried and some have already kissed GitHub goodbye. Time will tell who is correct."	Some clarification is need. Along with the 48 Democratic senators,  Sen.

The (x 1.5) crop factor would only be applied if you were using a full frame lens ([nikon brand full frame lenses are marked ""FX""](https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-AF-S-NIKKOR-35mm-1-8G/dp/B00HQ4W4XO))



Some quick notes each type of lens in relation to your camera:

DX lenses: fit your camera with no crop factor involved, are lighter and less expensive

FX lenses: are designed for cameras with full frame sensors therefor a crop factor of  x 1.5 is applied making the effective focal length longer, generally higher quality lenses, they are also usually heavier and larger, better coatings on lenses more likely to have better weather sealing, can be used with new camera if you decide to upgrade to a full frame body.

For what you're talking about landscape and nature without switching lenses I'd say 35mm is a pretty good focal length.. you may find yourself wishing you had something just a little wider for the landscapes.. 24mm or lower would be more ideal for that in my opinion..  you could also look into getting a zoom lens if you really didn't want to switch lenses at all.

Sure men and woman are different.... 

But that doesn't mean they are different. 

Pro-tip, any differences on a normal distribution has huge relative differences on outliers. In other words, the article concedes everything required to prove Damore's assertions, and proves only that so many people can appear articulate without basic statistics comprehension. 

In other words, looking at the data sets they could look identical in the center, where the bulk of men and women are similar, but if you accept that men aren't women, you concede everything necessary for massive extreme differences in the tails of a normal distribution. So an ignorant person could look at the middle and say they are the same, when someone else is showing that the tails are widely different. 

Edit:
Its also worth noting that if the normal distribution is 'stretched' that is the average is the same, so the middle of the curve is the same, but the standard deviation is larger, this would mean that there would be more mentally disabled men than women, and more genius men than women. Despite both averaging the same IQ/intelligence. There are 4x as many men with severe mental retardation 70 IQ as women. It's plausible there are also 4x as many men at the high end 130IQ to women, despite most men and women being equal, the tails could stretch leading to massive differences at the tails.  

When you combine this with other factors, such as men being more thing oriented, and women being more people oriented, and you have a difference in outliers, its possible that you would only expect 20-30% of the population of high intelligence careers to be women due to distribution (Scientist/Programmer/Engineer/Doctor). Then this might skew for preferences. Intelligent women are more likely to be able to do whatever they want (like intelligent men). So if they don't want to be programmers and would rather be doctors, you could have 30-50% doctors being female. (There are more female doctors graduating now in Canada than male). So those might be eating up intelligent women, taking them from other high intellect careers, so they might be less than 20% of engineers. "	AdviceAnimals	TwoXChromosomes	1

604	"I disagree with your Kerryon take. I WOULD play Conner over him as well, but I'm pretty okay with his situation. 

He's in, what should be, a high scoring offense, and should only see an increase in playing time as the season progresses. It looks like he's slowly being  worked in while Patricia relies on his vets. 

Riddick's playing time has already taken a hit. He has a role, but I don't think it will overlap KJ's very much. 

Blount's role will dwindle as well, though it will probably take a few more weeks. I don't even think he'll be that much of a goal line/touchdown vulture. He's aging and KJ is proving superior in just about every facet. He looks solid in pass-blocking. Solid in catching out of the backfield...

He's not going to be an RB1 at any point, but he'll most likely end up in the mix for rookie of the year. In my opinion, he'll match or slightly exceed his draft position. It's all about expectations, but I'm not sure what you feel is so terrible...

They COULD and should be a pass-first offense. Their defense is pretty bad, so they COULD end up playing from behind quite a bit, and forced to abandon the run (Which is really my only concern). They COULD turn to the vets more than you like. BUT... I really don't expect it. He is what he is. He is what you drafted him for. A strong flex-play with occasional RB2 numbers. "	"Agreed. I absolutely loved Gorillaz and Demon Days. Maybe two of my favorite albums of all-time - terrific from front to back. 

Plastic Beach was a bit of a drop off for me, although it had a few fantastic tracks. Rhinestone Eyes, On Melancholy Hill, To Binge, and Pirate Jet were really really good, but most of the album just didn't work with me. I thought a lot of it was cheesy or subpar and had too many special guests. 

I finally only recently listened to Humanz, and although I need to give it another go or two, I thought it was garbage. Seems light on effort and creativity. There's limited vocals from Damon. Lost are his clever lyrics and that Gorillaz feel. The first two albums were like masterpieces. This album, from honestly the little I've listened to it, sounds like a various artist mixtape.

607	"Can you source something that goes into detail?

I really doubt the EFF would speak so positively about something that's compromised in such a way.

_______

Detail from the EFF statement:

&gt; The ban on certain kinds of zero rating—the kinds that lead consumers to services that ISPs want them to use rather than giving them choices—also remains.

Which links to https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/06/californias-net-neutrality-bill-has-strong-zero-rating-protections-low-income

&gt; S.B. 822 bans the practice of self-dealing and discriminatory gatekeeping by ISPs outright, which is why those same ISPs will fight to take it out of the legislation before it becomes law. It is why they are actively attempting to mislead legislators in Sacramento with bogus superficial studies from groups that represent ISP interests like CALinnovates that ignore the fact that the data cap is an artificial construct that is designed to raise rates on wireless users and zero rating is how they exploit that structure. There is no benefit to Internet users by simply saying the ISP’s selected services do not have additional fees associated with them and nothing about the current structure is “free” because we have all compensated companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon to the tune of $26 billion in profits in just 2016 alone.

&gt; Without the ability to profit from discriminatory conduct, the wireless carriers will lose the financial incentive to use zero rating to create an inferior wireless Internet for those with limited income and will no longer be able to exploit their gatekeeper power.

So it sounds like the EFF is mostly concerned with zero-rating for mobile data.

The second link: http://sd11.senate.ca.gov/sites/sd11.senate.ca.gov/files/sb822_wclp_letter_on_zero_5-23.pdf

&gt; Discriminatory Zero-Rating
&gt; Zero-rating means that certain content is exempt from a user’s data cap. **It is important to
note that SB 822 does not prohibit all forms of zero-rating. SB 822 specifically allows zerorating
that benefits consumers, such as allowing for exempt data within a certain time period
(such as at night) so a user can backup their data**. It would also exempt charging for any app
of a certain type (such as all map/GPS applications). **The bill bars discriminatory zero-rating
that allows an ISP to pick between websites or applications of the same type, giving
preference to those co-owned with the ISP or that pay the ISP a fee.**

Basically, **there is no blanket ban on zero-rating, but it is restricted**.  The intent is to permit things like zero-rating low-network-demand times, so you can upload/download backups or other intensive network activities.

Without going into the specifics of reading the bill (and knowing all the contextual information about this issue, terms of art, etc.), I don't think the parent comment is accurate.  This bill does have protections for predatory zero-rating, but makes exceptions for reasonable use.  Whether this would still permit predatory activities is a reasonable concern, but I'd like to see the argument made in detail."	"Lift weights

613	"Hello, I am a non-Christian married to a Catholic so I think I can offer more direct experience that might hopefully be useful for you.

&gt;  But, how will my opinions of these things change if marriage is actually on the table? 

This is something I think you need to give serious personal thought on. What do you expect from a potential marriage in terms of your role, her role, and the church's role in your lives. What are you willing to participate in and what are you not okay with? It's easy to be very chill about religion when it's just a boyfriend/girlfriend thing but attitudes can change when it comes to how to live out one's life and raise a family. That's something you need to talk to her about and see what her expectations for you, herself, and the future will be and how the children will be raised and how the house will be run. 

&gt; but what happens when things get more serious?  

Because you were raised Catholic, the Church will treat you as Catholic despite what you claim to be now which isn't necessarily a bad thing because if you were a non-Christian, you might have had to get a dispensation from the Bishop to have permission to get married. So it'll make things easier.

The Church isn't as super discouraging as it used to be with interfaith marriages. What they expect is mostly that you will affirm that you will not interfere with her ability to practice her faith, and that you will not interfere with the children being raised Catholic. If the priest in charge of the process does not trust you to keep your word, you can be denied marriage. But again, you are technically Catholic so unless you say something incredibly stupid you should be fine. It's not like they have anyone following up to see how Catholic you are.

You will be expected to attend premarital counseling either in the form of sessions or a weekend long retreat where you will have intensive talks about relationships, communication, conflict-management and then lots of intimate one-on-one talks with your partner about all aspects of your relationship going forward. 

The wedding MUST be in a Catholic Church and typically it's her own parish. The Bishop has to approve getting married anywhere else but since you're both considered Catholic it's extremely unlikely you have a justifiable reason to be married outside of a Catholic Church. You can get married in other parishes, but it requires lots of paperwork and getting married in a parish that is not your own comes with a hefty premium cost, especially if the parish is historic and/or aesthetically unique. 

&gt; Is it possible she might try to convert me then, even though she told me she never would? 

You need to talk to her about this and work out an understanding of expectations, if you are afraid she will turn on you that's a huge point of concern that needs to be ironed out. But it's things like this that are exactly why premarital counseling exists, to help you sort things out for a successful future (or to identify why it wont work). 

&gt; Any couples that have had the same experience? How did things turn out in the long run? 

My wife and I have been happily married for almost five years. At the very beginning of the relationship we did a whole lot of discussion on our religious backgrounds because we both knew it was a potential issue. Even if we didn't agree on things like the nature of the universe, we did seek to find if we shared similar values, morals, and ethics and similar attitudes on how a marriage should work, and how our family would be raised. It's something that every couple should be doing no matter the religion but people sometimes overlook it and just assume that both people being ""Christian"" have similar attitudes and values. But by building a relationship on blocks by blocks of shared understanding instead of assumptions you can create an stable resilient relationship with mutual trust and respect.

Pressure treated is a frugal choice on a fence cause the maintenance required to even have a chance of normal wood lasting long will cost much more, not to mention time.  From what I can see you didn't use pressure treated (can't tell for sure from pic)- most of the stuff bought today has a copperish brown cast and up close you'll see little score lines.  

Did you intend to make your fence look like a mess?  Usually people keep their rails evenly spaced (the cross pieces you attach the fence boards to) and section to section will match (depending on grade).

Looking at your picture again I am sensing that your rebuild didn't actually follow what was there, which can be fine.  Ideally you have a three rail fence, but two can work.  I just did a two rail for a friend and it's fine a month later except for three boards out of 172.  Those three are way warped now.  Anyway, with a two rail fence you're best served havid that top rail much higher, say a foot down if those are six foot boards.  I like using screws for fences.  They hold very well and you can easily replace boards as needed.  An impact driver makes screwing or unscrewing very quick-- it's not as fast as a nail gun, but it's a much better job and way better and faster than a hand swung hammer.

If Joy get your rails even and the woods stain everything it should look fine.  If the different posts bug you you can make decent covers out of fence boards.

Still, making huge tax cuts while the economy is already doing well, with no plans to pay for it, is just not good planning. The economic growth we've seen over the last couple of years has been roughly the same as what we saw under Obama, while we've had to borrow more money from China, increasing the deficit, with very little benefit to the poor and middle class. We will have to pay for that eventually, probably after a recession and under a Democrat. Ruining our relationships with allies and trading partners is not going to help.

This deal with Japan is a good example.  One of the lines that do really well under it, are hard cheeses.  That's something that plays to the UK (&amp; Ireland!) really well.  That particular line doesn't benefit other countries as much.  It's a great example of a line that the UK would call a win, but at least 50% of EU countries are going to meh over.

If France made this deal, they'd be wondering if they really have to start making cheddar.  If the UK made this deal, they'd be high-fiving dairy farmers.  Not every deal that's in the EU's best interests is in the UK's best interests, and not every deal in the UK's best interests is in the EU's best interests.

(I still fundamentally believe it's a net win for the EU in aggregate.  But arguments could be made on a case-by-case basis.  If the UK wins every such case-by-case, it could come out on top.

"I love my iphone X, so I'll touch on the faceid thing.

I think you focus a lot on talking poo because it's the primary place where it's actually visible.  The main benefits of faceid for me, are that it's almost invisible.

My SO looks at my phone, and there's a notification that says I have a new message from Fred.  I look at my phone, and it adds the first line of the message.  She doesn't see that, I do.  It's so smooth it took me a while to figure out it was even doing it.

When my alarm goes off, it goes quiet \(not off, just significantly quieter\) as soon as I'm looking at the screen.  It waits for me to action the alarm to actually dismiss it, but it chills out as soon as it knows I'm aware.  I wake up at 5am, so my SO appreciates this more than I do.

Logging into websites, the faceid logo flashes past before it unlocks the password from my keychain.  Not just on web forms, I've a few apps that use touchid/faceid to resume an existing login \(amazon, our weird oncall app for work, etc\), and it works there.  It's so frictionless that they had to add the double\-click thing to the appstore to stop purchases going through before you could read the price tag.

FaceID is a weird one because the better it works, the less you notice it.  If it's working perfectly it's hardly a feature at all.  This is a great example of the Apple I remember \- the best features are invisible.

"I don’t know about Taiwan, but a lot of countries have laws about rehabilitating wildlife. Here in the US, you have to be licensed and certified to care for specific wildlife. Like a person that rehabilitates crows probably just focuses specifically on crows. They’re wild animals, there’s a lot to know to care for them properly and you need specific and (usually) expensive facilities to do it with. Even then, it’s rare that such cases are ever successfully reintroduced to the wild, and the average crow lifespan is about 8-10 years. It’s more than just money and knowledge, it’s time. It’s not something just anyone can do.

That said, there’s nothing wrong with having some buddies that visit your house every now and then. Still, they are wild animals, and you have to be careful of accidentally hurting them. As far as I know, they aren’t a protected species or anything, but they fall under a lot of general wildlife laws.

So, Amazon benefits from being able to use AWS and being able to sell AWS to customers. If they didn't build their systems this way, then they couldn't also sell it as a service.

For me, it's about the environment and trying to make the best decisions that I can.

I sort of feel irresponsible just hording every extra penny that I have when we have such a huge issue we are facing.

&gt; Frugal can mean investment now for long term gain.

It depends what you compare it to. Making energy efficiency purchases with extremely long paybacks may be less financially wise than taking that same money and investing it, in addition to exposing yourself for a longer period of time to other events that could extend or destroy that payback.

For example, years ago I spent about $2,500 in my attic doing air sealing, radiant barrier, attic door insulation, duct repair (for air leaks), and a lot of insulation. It reduced my power usage about 20% on a KwHr basis, but dropped my bill even less due to the fee structures.

When I looked at it, just that work had like an 8 year payback, and I think this was before natural gas prices crashed.

At normal market returns, the above project will always lag just having the money invested. At 20 years, a 7% return on the original $2,500 money will be ~$9,000, while the above project will be at around $6500 of value (that includes investing the savings at the same 7% rate once the payback is reached.)

Some of this stuff will depend on a lot of factors, so for you it may make sense. It depends on local energy costs, lifestyle, house condition, and climate. Carbon wise, it probably always makes sense to do.

I looked at getting storm windows on my house (I have a historic home). They were like 550 / window. Even if they reduced my power bill to $0 / month (they won't), I'd be looking at a 7 year payback.

The situation is similar with Solar here. New solar isn't getting net metering last I heard because of some peak power limit that was exceeded by solar. A friend is having this issue and is now looking at adding a battery array.

I'm also not sure of the solar tax credit at this point, but you could be looking at a solar panel array that has a very long payback.

Carbon wise, the above makes sense. Financially, the longer the payback, the longer of a time that you're exposed to other risks on that system where you're not 'building equity'.

"I actually have a general problem with Magical Realism in the US *because* it's ethos is tied to the manifestation of the religious element; the exception being Southern Gothic, which is a regional Magical Realism that focuses on the uniquely pious nature of the South - Latin American Writers *were also greatly influenced by Faulkner and the Southern Gothic for this reason.* Magical Realism without the piousness doesn't make sense.

I haven't read Letham, but I remember a New Republic essay about 4-5 years ago that discussed Letham against DFW, saying Lehtam's style ending up winning because it was a Post Modern Mix of High and Low Culture that created works that were just pensive enough to be considered Art, but certainly more entertaining which lent to their popularity. Again, I haven't read Letham so I can't certainly say, but if what you say is true about the influence of comics on his work I work categorize it completely differently from Magical Realism; say, Pulp Fantasticalism. 

I think when discussing magic in art you have to discuss it in a way that informs the worldview of the artwork. John Constantine/HellBlazer, or Preacher aren't Magical Realism (even though they discuss the religious element); they have more in common with Southern Gothic, and I'd categorize them as London Gothic and Western Gothic, respectively. Kafka, if you accept turning into cockroach is magical, isn't magical realism, it's Absurd and/or Surrealism. I don't think the US (with the exception of the Southern Gothic) can really *do* a Magical Realism based on teh nature of our piousness. The US/West *can* do magical stories though; ""American Gods"" is still on my shelf to be read but it seems closer to the Southern/Western Gothic. 

You hit the nail on the head with Drown. I felt like it was a cheap, Dominican knock-off of Carver. He did no magic in his short stories, which is why it felt fake in the novel. And holy shit, it is a little too close to Bukowski for the New Yorker.

Even if this was a hookup situation, she still has a right to change her mind, but she should have communicated that to you so that it wouldn’t have been a waste of time or money. However, you could have asked her if she changed her mind and then just accepted her answer without getting pissed at her. Remember that hookups can be risky and a lot of women are intimidated by men, so if she’s changed her mind, she could be afraid of your reaction. That doesn’t seem to be the case in this particular situation, but it could always happen.

NBN have overpriced the hell out of the ""middle leg"" of data transit to the point that ISP's can no longer provide the product people want, at a price people are prepared to pay. There are more expensive premium providers that are better, but still rarely perfect.

ADSL had line length issues, but outright congestion was a much less common issue simply because an ISP could afford to have a reasonable amount of backhaul capacity - there was enough bandwidth to go around.

Now people don't want to be paying heaps more for NBN, so retail prices haven't changed that much, but the ISP can't afford (at those prices) to put in as much backhaul so speeds suffer. This is further compounded by the fact that higher speeds than ever are on offer too (though I'm not going to complain about that fact lol).

NBN needs to lower backhaul rates to a point where at least ISP's can offer a comparable product to the ADSL everyone used to get, otherwise we're all just going backwards.

Also, every time the govt (or one of it's watchdogs, departments or whatever) blames an ISP it is just straight up covering up the inadequacy and terrible structuring and pricing of the NBN - which is of course is perfect."

If, as a nation, the society felt poor families had a right to a certain minimum level of financial means, then there are ways to enable that. I don't feel that using the minimum wage would be an effective way of achieving that goal.

868	"It's not the full reason, but [part of it is cost disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease) (Economist [article](http://www.economist.com/node/21563714)). Certain labour intensive sectors have lower productivity growth than the rest of the economy. However, to retain and employ new staff they have to keep up with rising wages in the rest of the economy. The inevitable result of this is rising prices. You see it in healthcare to a huge extent. The point raised by Baumol is very true and applies to education too:

&gt;The real problem is not the cost disease, Mr Baumol argues, but knee-jerk reactions to it. The most likely response to spiralling budgets for publicly provided medicine and education is to shift provision to the private sector. But that will not cure the underlying disease. High costs could also lead to excessive rationing, slowing development over the long term.

&gt;If it happens, such a reaction rests on a mistaken premise: that the rising costs in the stagnant sectors make people poorer. In fact, buying power is growing much faster than medicine, education and the arts are becoming dearer. Mr Baumol’s crystal ball says that in 100 years a live performance of a Mozart quartet will be vastly more expensive, but people will still be able to afford it.

As he says, our kneejerk reaction could be very damaging, especially in healthcare we are seeing this very acutely in the UK, with more and more people dying because the state isn't willing to pony up the increasing costs. 

It's also one reason why the student loan system can be good, it allows more investment. [Prior to the introduction state rationing meant lower and lower levels of investment in education.](https://i.gyazo.com/08622f13afce7ad15ea15fb72879036c.png) Of course, it doesn't solve the issue because fees are still capped at the end of the day.

Each cell inside of you has stores of adenosine triphosphate that it uses to create the necessary energy required to perform its functions. The adenosine isn't quite what's important, as long as there's a phosphate, you're golden. When you load creatine, your body converts it to creatinine phosphate that it stores similarly to the ATP. I'm not sure about how/when it uses creatinine phosphate when there is abailable ATP, but the CP will he used when ATP gets low. This store of phosphate will allow you 1-3 extra reps at a near maximal load due to your muscle cells having a ""back up tank"" of energy.

So what.  Overhead can lead to increased profits.  Marketing costs, for example, are considered overhead.  

&gt; Since we liked to have a productive economy.

Not as much as we like higher investment returns...  Individual investors value returns over aggregate economic productivity.

&gt; Yes

Exactly...

"	"&gt; Are you telling me the interview process for software developers isn't a subjective process, and that promotions aren't based on office politics?

The fact that we don't live in a perfect meritocracy doesn't mean we can throw ability out the window.  You're doubling down on this insane argument, and I'm not going there.  It's absurd.  Some engineers are simply more valuable than other engineers to their teams, companies, etc.  It's irrefutable.

&gt; Now in once point your saying biologically women are inferior at performing the job of being software developers

I never said that.  I'm suggesting that on average, males and females are different, including our brains.  That's scientific truth.

There isn't enough evidence to say that those differences should result in a higher percentage of engineers being male.  But there is enough to demonstrate we can't claim females should represent 50% of the engineering work force.

But if there were scientific evidence that say, females should make up 18% of the engineering force, that shouldn't change the feminist argument.  Females should be judged on their ability and value to the company, not their sex.  Arguments that are based on imaginary notions of idealism that could potentially be debunked by science are weak arguments.

&gt; I also don't see the negative impact of diversity

Again, neither do I.  I see a problem with mandated diversity.  I've seen more qualified people passed up.  I've seen positions created out of thin air to hire a female in order to fill a real position with a male who happened to be the most qualified for that position in order to meet diversity metrics (which is ultimately a disservice to the female going into the made up position).

This stuff happens.  You can make pretend it doesn't, or claim you don't care, but that's irrelevant.

But that's the key here. Support for vaccinations is far higher in Western Europe but I doubt that people have a much better understanding of how vaccinations works. It's not really about explaining science but that Americans lack trust in authorities. The way most Europeans sees vaccinations is ""the government said it's good, all those professors from our unis say it's good... okay a bunch of randoms disagree but why would I trust them?"". Also in most European countries you have multiple political parties, so it's not ""them vs us"".

884	"&gt; Since October of last year, (the US Olympic Committee has) been engaged in direct talks with USAG leadership on this fundamental point. New leadership at the board level is critical and you recently saw three USAG board resignations.

This includes a full turnover of leadership from the past, [which means that all current USAG directors must resign](https://www.teamusa.org/News/2018/January/24/Open-Letters-To-Team-USA-Athletes-Regarding-Nassar-Case).

A traditional and yet to be refuted case is the fact that women prefer people-oriented skills and environments where men prefer object and solo-oriented environments. Many jobs don't fall into either category very well, but the plumber example is a decent one for men.

Edit: in my personal, amateur opinion it makes more sense to combine theropods into birds than it does to combine birds into dinosaurs, birds and theropod have obvious and clear similarities in terms of body structure, which only has loose resemblances to sauropods, to say nothing of the more distantly related dinosaurs "	Games	science	1

"I'm not gonna lie... I thought the interviewer was a bit unfair to Glenn beck... I think Glenn Beck was trying to say something that was actually true; that the cathartic attacks on Donald Trump and his supporters, invigorates his base and makes him powerful. Beck goes on to explain that he understands this because he operated by exploiting the same kinds of emotions that Donald trump was and he sees how the media plays into that. In a weird way I likened what he was trying to say as a hacker explaining to cyber security people about how to prevent being hacked. 

This guy then goes on to basically insinuate that Beck doesn't really have a genuine concern, but just wants to sell his station. Maybe Glenn Beck is the type of person who deserves to be treated poorly from time time, but I understand why Beck was justifiably pissed off. This guy basically ignored everything he was saying and just psychoanalyzed him as having some weird ulterior motive. Again maybe this isn't undeserved for beck, but it really came across as quite douchy.
